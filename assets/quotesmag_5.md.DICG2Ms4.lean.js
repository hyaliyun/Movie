His films are noted for the distinct influence of Renaissance and Baroque painting, and Flemish painting in particular. Common traits in his film are the scenic composition and illumination and the contrasts of costume and nudity, nature and architecture, furniture and people, sexual pleasure and painful death. Early life Greenaway was born in Newport, Monmouthshire, Wales, to a teacher mother and a builder's merchant father. Greenaway's family left South Wales when he was three years old (they had moved there originally to avoid the Blitz) and settled in Chingford, Essex (later to become part of greater London). He attended Forest School in northeast London. At an early age Greenaway decided on becoming a painter. He became interested in European cinema, focusing first on the films of Ingmar Bergman, and then on the French nouvelle vague filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard and, most especially, Alain Resnais. He now lives in Amsterdam. Career 1962‚Äì1999 44th Venice Film Festival (1987) In 1962, Greenaway began studies at Walthamstow College of Art, where a fellow student was musician Ian Dury (later cast in The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover). Greenaway trained as a muralist for three years; he made his first film, Death of Sentiment, a churchyard furniture essay filmed in four large London cemeteries. In 1965, he joined the Central Office of Information (COI), working there fifteen years as a film editor and director. In that time he created a filmography of experimental films, starting with Train (1966), footage of the last steam trains at Waterloo station (situated behind the COI), edited to a musique concr√®te composition. Tree (1966), is a homage to the embattled tree growing in concrete outside the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank in London. By the 1970s he was confident and ambitious and made Vertical Features Remake and A Walk Through H. The former is an examination of various arithmetical editing structures, and the latter is a journey through the maps of a fictitious country. In 1980, Greenaway delivered The Falls (his first feature-length film) ‚Äì a mammoth, fantastical, absurdist encyclopaedia of flight-associated material all relating to ninety-two victims of what is referred to as the Violent Unknown Event (VUE). In the 1980s, Greenaway's cinema flowered in his best-known films, The Draughtsman's Contract (1982), A Zed & Two Noughts (1985), The Belly of an Architect (1987), Drowning by Numbers (1988), and his most successful (and controversial) film, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989). Greenaway's most familiar musical collaborator during this period is composer Michael Nyman, who has scored several films. In 1989, he collaborated with artist Tom Phillips on a television serial A TV Dante, dramatising the first few cantos of Dante's Inferno. In the 1990s, he presented Prospero's Books (1991), the controversial The Baby of M√¢con (1993), The Pillow Book (1996), and 8¬Ω Women (1999). In the early 1990s, Greenaway wrote ten opera libretti known as the Death of a Composer series, dealing with the commonalities of the deaths of ten composers from Anton Webern to John Lennon, however, the other composers are fictitious, and one is a character from The Falls. In 1995, Louis Andriessen completed the sixth libretto, Rosa ‚Äì A Horse Drama. He is currently professor of cinema studies at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland. 2000‚Äìpresent Greenaway presented the ambitious The Tulse Luper Suitcases, a multimedia project that resulted in three films, a website, two books, a touring exhibition, and a shorter feature which reworked the material of the first three films. He also contributed to Visions of Europe, a short film collection by different European Union directors; his British entry is The European Showerbath. Nightwatching and Rembrandt's J'Accuse two films on Rembrandt which were released in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Nightwatching is the first feature in the series \\"Dutch Masters\\", with the second project titled as Goltzius and the Pelican Company. On 17 June 2005, Greenaway appeared for his first VJ performance during an art club evening in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with music by DJ Serge Dodwell (aka Radar), as a backdrop, 'VJ' Greenaway used for his set a special system consisting of a large plasma screen with laser controlled touchscreen to project the ninety-two Tulse Luper stories on the twelve screens of \\"Club 11\\", mixing the images live. This was later reprised at the Optronica festival, London. On 12 October 2007, he created the multimedia installation Peopling the Palaces at Venaria Reale at the Royal Palace of Venaria that animates the Palace with 100 videoprojectors. Greenaway was interviewed for Clive Meyer's Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice (2011), and voiced strong criticisms of film theory as distinct from discussions of other media: \\"Are you sufficiently happy with cinema as a thinking medium if you are only talking to one person?\\" On 3 May 2016, he received a Honoris Causa doctorate from the University of San Mart√≠n, Argentina. Nine Classical Paintings Revisited In 2006, Greenaway began a series of digital video installations, Nine Classical Paintings Revisited, with his exploration of Rembrandt's Night Watch in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. On 30 June 2008, after much negotiation, Greenaway staged a one- night performance 'remixing' da Vinci's The Last Supper in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie\\"Leonardo's Last Supper\\" , Peter Greenaway's official site. in Milan to a select audience of dignitaries. The performance consisted of superimposing digital imagery and projections onto the painting with music from the composer Marco Robino. File:La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpgNight Watch by Rembrandt File:Paolo Veronese 008.jpgThe Wedding at Cana by Paolo Veronese (mid-16th century) Greenaway exhibited his digital exploration of The Wedding at Cana by Paolo Veronese as part of the 2009 Venice Biennial. An arts writer for The New York Times called it \\"possibly the best unmanned art history lecture you'll ever experience,\\" while acknowledging that some viewers might respond to it as \\"mediocre art, Disneyfied kitsch or a flamboyant denigration of site-specific video installation.\\" The 50-minute presentation, set to a soundtrack, incorporates closeup images of faces from the painting along with animated diagrams revealing compositional relations among the figures. These images are projected onto and around the replica of the painting that now stands at the original site, within the Palladian architecture of the Benedictine refectory on San Giorgio Maggiore. The soundtrack features music and imagined dialogue scripted by Greenaway for the 126 \\"wedding guests, servants, onlookers and wedding crashers\\" depicted in the painting, consisting of small talk and banal chatter that culminates in reaction to the miraculous transformation of water to wine, according to the Gospels the first miracle performed by Jesus. Picasso's Guernica, Seurat's Grande Jatte, works by Jackson Pollock and Claude Monet, Vel√°zquez's Las Meninas and Michelangelo's The Last Judgment are possible series subjects.Roberta Smith, \\"In Venice, Peter Greenaway Takes Veronese's Figures Out to Play,\\" The New York Times 21 June 2009 online.

It marks the beginning of the transition from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic via the interim Mesolithic (Northern Europe and Western Europe) and Epipaleolithic (Levant and Near East) periods, which together form the first part of the Holocene epoch that is generally reckoned to have begun c. 9700 BC (c. 11.7 ka) and is the current geological epoch. It is impossible to precisely date events that happened around the time of this millennium and all dates mentioned here are estimates mostly based on geological and anthropological analysis. Holocene epoch The main characteristic of the Holocene has been the worldwide abundance of Homo sapiens sapiens (humankind). The epoch began in the wake of the W√ºrm glaciation, generally known as the Last Ice Age, which began 109 ka and ended 14 ka when Homo sapiens sapiens was in the Palaeolithic (Old Stone) Age. Following the Late Glacial Interstadial from 14 ka to 12.9 ka, during which global temperatures rose significantly, the Younger Dryas began. This was a temporary reversal of climatic warming to glacial conditions in the Northern Hemisphere and coincided with the end of the Upper Palaeolithic. The Younger Dryas ceased c. 9700 BC, marking the cutover from Pleistocene to Holocene. In the geologic time scale, there are three (tentatively four) stratigraphic stages of the Holocene beginning c. 9700 BC with the \\"Greenlandian\\" (to c. 6236 BC). The starting point for the Greenlandian is the Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) sample from the North Greenland Ice Core Project, which has been correlated with the Younger Dryas. The Greenlandian was succeeded by the \\"Northgrippian\\" (to c. 2250 BC) and the \\"Meghalayan\\". All three stages were officially ratified by the International Commission on Stratigraphy in July 2018. It has been proposed that the Meghalayan should be terminated c. 1950 and succeeded by a new stage provisionally called \\"Anthropocene\\". In the Holocene's first millennium, the Palaeolithic began to be superseded by the Neolithic (New Stone) Age which lasted about 6,000 years, depending on location. The gradual transition period is sometimes termed Mesolithic (northern and western Europe) or Epipalaeolithic (Levant and Near East). The glaciers retreated as the world climate became warmer and that inspired an agricultural revolution, though at first the dog was probably the only domesticated animal. This was accompanied by a social revolution in that humans gained from agriculture the impetus to settle. Settlement is the key precursor to civilisation, which cannot be achieved by a nomadic lifestyle. The world population, c. 10,000 BC, is believed to have been more or less stable. It has been estimated that there were some five million people at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, growing to forty million by 5000 BC and 100 million by 1600 BC which is an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. from the Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age. Around 10,000 BC, most people lived in hunter-gatherer communities scattered across all continents except Antarctica and Zealandia. As the W√ºrm/Wisconsin ended, settlement of northern regions was again possible. Beginnings of agriculture Agriculture developed in different parts of the world at different times. In many places, people learned how to cultivate without outside help; elsewhere, as in western Europe, the skills were imported. The Natufian culture prevailed in the Levant through the 10th millennium and was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. An early example is 'Ain Mallaha, which may have been the first village in which people were wholly sedentary. The Natufian people are believed to have founded another early settlement on the site of Jericho (Tell es-Sultan) where there is evidence of building between 9600 BC and 8200 BC. Dates for the Natufian are indeterminate and range broadly from c. 13,050 BC to c. 7550 BC. It is possible that the early cultivation of figs began in the Jordan River valley sometime after the middle of the 10th millennium.Kislev et al. (2006a, b), Lev-Yadun et al. (2006) Besides the fig trees, the people may have begun cultivation of wild plants such as barley and pistachio; and they possibly began herding goats, pigs and cattle. Agriculture began to be developed by the various communities of the Fertile Crescent, which included the Levant, but it would not be widely practised for another 2,000 years by which time Neolithic culture was becoming well established in many parts of the Near East. Among the earliest cultivated plants were forms of millet and rice grown in the Middle East, possibly in this millennium but more likely after 9000 BC. By about 9500 BC, people in south-eastern Anatolia were harvesting wild grasses and grains. The earliest evidence of sheep herding has been found in northern Iraq, dated before 9000 BC. Pottery Prehistoric chronology is almost entirely reliant upon the dating of material objects of which pottery is by far the most widespread and the most resistant to decay. All locations and generations developed their own shapes, sizes and styles of pottery, including methods and styles of decoration, but there was consistency among stratified deposits and even shards can be classified by time and place. Pottery is believed to have been discovered independently in various places, beginning with China c. 18,000 BC, and was probably created accidentally by fires lit on clay soil. The main discovery of pottery dated to the 10th millennium has been at Ounjougou (c.9400 BC) in Central Mali, providing evidence of an independent invention of pottery in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first chronological pottery system was the Early, Middle and Late Minoan framework devised in the early 20th century by Sir Arthur Evans for his findings at Knossos. This covered the Bronze Age in twelve phases from c. 2800 BC to c. 1050 BC and the principle was later extended to mainland Greece (Helladic) and the Aegean islands (Cycladic). Dame Kathleen Kenyon was the principal archaeologist at Tell es-Sultan (ancient Jericho) and she discovered that there was no pottery there. The potter's wheel had not yet been invented and, where pottery as such was made, it was still hand-built, often by means of coiling, and pit fired. Kenyon discovered vessels such as bowls, cups and plates at Jericho which were made from stone. She reasonably surmised that others made from wood or vegetable fibres would have long since decayed. Using Evans' system as a benchmark, Kenyon divided the Near East Neolithic into phases called Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), from c. 10,000 BC to c. 8800 BC; Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), from c. 8800 BC to c. 6500 BC; and then Pottery Neolithic (PN), which had varied start- points from c. 6500 BC until the beginnings of the Bronze Age towards the end of the 4th millennium. In the 10th millennium, the Natufian culture co-existed with the PPNA which prevailed in the Levantine and upper Mesopotamian areas of the Fertile Crescent. Other cultural developments Africa Example of Saharan rock art depicting giraffes from Anakom, Niger. In North Africa, Saharan rock art engravings in what is known as the Bubalus (Large Wild Fauna) period have been dated to between 10,000 BC and 7000 BC. Wall paintings found in Ethiopia and Eritrea depict human activity; some of the older paintings are thought to date back to around 10,000 BC. The Abu Madi tel mounds in the Sinai Peninsula have been dated c. 9660 to c. 9180 BC. Americas The Clovis culture was widely distributed throughout North America. The people were hunter-gatherers and the culture's duration is believed to have been from c.9050 BC to c.8800 BC. There is evidence of increasing use of Clovis point tool technology for hunting. Elsewhere in North America, the Petroglyphs at Winnemucca Lake, in what is today northwest Nevada, were carved by this time, possibly as early as 12.8 ka or as late as 10 ka. Eurasia The sites at G√∂bekli Tepe and Hallan √áemi Tepesi, both in south-eastern Anatolia, and at Tell Qaramel in north-west Syria, may have been occupied during this millennium. In Great Britain, which was not then an island, the Star Carr site in North Yorkshire is believed to have been inhabited by Maglemosian peoples for about 800 years from c. 9335 BC to c. 8525 BC. Environmental changes In the southern hemisphere, rising sea levels had gradually formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from mainland Australia. This process is believed to have been complete by about the beginning of the 10th millennium. Bass Strait had been a plain populated by indigenous people who are thought to have first arrived around 40,000 years ago. The Wisconsin glaciation had sheeted much of North America and, as it retreated, its meltwaters created an immense proglacial lake now known as Lake Agassiz. Sometime after 10,000 BC, the retreating glaciers created the rock formation on Cannon Mountain in present- day New Hampshire that was known as the Old Man of the Mountain until its collapse in 2003. Chronological method The ongoing Quaternary System/Period represents the last 2.58 million years since the end of the Neogene and is officially divided into the Pleistocene and Holocene Series/Epochs. The Holocene has been assigned an age of 11,700 calendar years before 2000 CE which means it began c. 9700 BC in the 10th millennium. It is preceded in the geological time scale by the Late Pleistocene sub-epoch, also known as the Tarantian Stage/Age, which awaits formal ratification by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and tentatively spans the time from c. 126,000 BC to c. 9700 BC. Preceding the Late Pleistocene is the Middle Pleistocene sub-epoch, or Chibanian Stage/Age, which also awaits ratification and tentatively spans the time from c. 773,000 BC to c. 126,000 BC. The Early Pleistocene from c. 2,580,000 BC until c. 773,000 is sub-divided into two Stages/Ages which have been officially defined: the Gelasian (until c. 1,800,000 BC) and the Calabrian. The Holocene calendar, devised by Cesare Emiliani in 1993, places its epoch at 10,000 BC (with the year being rendered as 1 HE). It is complicated by the effective inclusion of a year zero, in that 10,000 coincides with the Julian year 1 BC, because Emiliani wanted 10,000 as the birth year for Jesus Christ (wrongly, as Christ was born c. 4 BC). This renders all BC years out of synch. Notes Bibliography      -90 ","title":"10th millennium BC"},{"id":"55460","text":"Do√±ana National Park is a natural reserve in Andalusia, southern Spain, in the provinces of Huelva (most of its territory), C√°diz and Seville. It covers , of which are a protected area. The park is an area of marshes, shallow streams, and sand dunes in Las Marismas, the delta where the Guadalquivir River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. It was established as a nature reserve in 1969 when the World Wildlife Fund joined with the Spanish government and purchased a section of marshes to protect it. The eco-system has been under constant threat by the draining of the marshes, the use of river water to boost agricultural production by irrigating land along the coast, water pollution by upriver mining, and the expansion of tourist facilities.A History of WWF It is named after wife of the seventh Duke of Medina-Sidonia. Do√±ana National Park has a biodiversity that is unique in Europe, although there are some similarities to the Parc Naturel R√©gional de Camargue of the Camargue river delta in France, with which Do√±ana Park is twinned. The park features a great variety of ecosystems and shelters wildlife including thousands of European and African migratory birds, fallow deer, Spanish red deer, wild boars, European badgers, Egyptian mongooses, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx. The Do√±ana nature reserve includes both the Do√±ana National Park, established in 1969, and the Natural Park, created in 1989 and expanded in 1997, creating a buffer zone of protection under the management of the regional government. The two parks, national and natural, have since been classified as a single natural landscape. Due to its strategic location between the continents of Europe and Africa and its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, Do√±ana's large expanse of salt marsh is a breeding ground as well as a transit point for thousands of European and African birds (aquatic and terrestrial), and hosts many species of migratory waterfowl during the winter, typically up to 200,000 individuals. Over 300 different species of birds may be sighted there annually. Considered the largest nature reserve in Europe, several different scientific institutions have monitoring stations within its boundaries to ensure appropriate development of adjacent lands and conservation of the threatened species that inhabit it. The area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994; in 2006 the park recorded 376,287 visitors. During the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden in 1829. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers. Geology and geomorphology Do√±ana - Aerial view of Do√±ana National Park and surrounding areas The geological profile of Do√±ana National Park reflects the development over several hundred thousand years of a deep aquifer and geomorphological features that have enhanced the biodiversity of the wildlife habitats presently found there. After the end of the last glacial period, the area was covered by freshwater and brackish marshes, ponds and sand dunes, with some marine intrusions caused by high-energy events such as tsunamis and large storms. A period of comparatively rapid rise in global sea level during the first part of the Flandrian interglacial was associated with the melting of the paleoglaciers, and reached its maximum level 6,500‚Äì7,000 years ago. At this time, Do√±ana National Park and the surrounding areas were flooded, and a lagoon, later called Lacus Ligustinus by the Romans, was formed. The pace of infilling of the lagoon has increased over the last 6,000 years, along with accelerated growth of sandspits and the creation of new inland marshes and wetlands. The extensive marshes of Do√±ana National Park now have a flat topography, with some inland depressions occupied by temporary or permanent wetlands, locally called 'lucios'. The whole area is protected by the Do√±ana spit, a wide sandy littoral barrier with mobile dune systems growing toward the southeast. History Antiquity Banks of the River Guadalquivir in Do√±ana National Park Although the topography of Do√±ana is a relatively new land feature as measured on the geological time scale, remains of Neolithic tools have been found in the area. Various ancient civilizations may have had a presence there as long as 2,800 years ago, including the Phoenicians, the Phocaean Greeks and the Tartessians, but archaeological remains attesting to such have not been found. In 1923, the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten, accompanied by Adolf Lammerer and George Bonsor, searched for the location of the ancient Tartessian capital in the Do√±ana dunes, but found nothing of interest. These excavations were carried out at Cerro del Trigo and funded by the Duke of Tarifa and Denia, then owner of Do√±ana.Schulten 2006, p. 20 Nevertheless, in 1978 Schulten found the stele of Villamanrique at the nearby town of Villamanrique de la Condesa. Surveys were made in 2007 in the Hinojos salt marsh, or \\"Marisma de Hinojos\\", of Huelva province, in an effort to discover traces of the mythical city. Noteworthy finds included the remains of Roman settlements, dating from the 2nd through the 5th centuries AD, which had been primarily engaged in fishing and fish salting or the preparation of garum. The Guadalquivir Marshes (Las Marismas del Guadalquivir), an area of marshy lowlands near the left bank of the mouth of the Guadalquivir, was then a large inland lake known as the Lacus Ligustinus in Latin. The lake slowly infilled with deposited sediment, gradually giving way to the current marshes. Middle Ages ;Alfonso X the Wise In 1262, after conquering the vassal kingdom of Niebla, King Alfonso X established a Real Cazadero (royal hunting preserve) in the Las Rocinas forest, between the Rio Tinto and the Guadalquivir, partly due to the abundance of deer there, as well as the small sanctuary of Santa Olalla, since disappeared, on the Arroyo de la Rocina. In 1297, his son Sancho IV granted Guzm√°n el Bueno the Lordship of Sanl√∫car, consisting of the territory located behind Arenas Gordas on the left bank of the Guadalquivir estuary, and which remained in the hands of the House of Medina-Sidonia for over six centuries. The noble house was established in 1369, when Henry II of Castile granted the fourth Lord of Sanl√∫car the County of Niebla. In 1493 the Catholic Monarchs donated part of the land of the present village of El Roc√≠o to the royal secretary, whose son later sold it to the town of Almonte. Previously, new breeding stock had been introduced among the local populations of wild boar and deer, while wolf hunting was encouraged for the benefit of cattle and horse ranching. Early modern Nearly a century later, Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, 7th Duke of Medina Sidonia and commander of the Spanish Armada, bought back part of the land. His wife, Ana de Silva y Mendoza, daughter of the Princess of Eboli, moved to a country retreat there called \\"Coto de Do√±a Ana\\" (Do√±a Ana Game Preserve), which was the origin of the current name \\"Do√±ana\\"; the house was renovated years later as a palace. Reference to the use of Coto Donana as a hunting lodge is made in the first verses of the La F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea), which the lyric poet Luis de G√≥ngora dedicated to the Count of Niebla, and in which he requests that the nobles suspend their hunting exploits to hear his verses. In 1624, King Philip IV stayed at the estate for several days as a guest of the 9th Duke of Medina Sidonia, and joined in some large hunts. He brought with him a great variety of comestibles, which included such luxuries as snow from the mountains for the frequent banquets he held in honor of the duke. In 1797 Francisco Goya stayed in the palace as a guest of his patrons, the 15th Duke of Medina-Sidonia and his wife, the 13th Duchess of Alba. Here Goya created his √Ålbum A, a collection of drawings, and apparently painted his famous portraits, La Maja Vestida (\\"The Clothed Maja\\") and La Maja Desnuda (\\"The Naked Maja\\"), rumored to portray the duchess. Late modern, creation of the National Park After 1854, with the publishing of a discussion of the area in a treatise called \\"Avifauna de Do√±ana: Cat√°logo de las aves observadas en algunas provincias andaluzas\\" (\\"Avifauna of Do√±ana: Catalogue of the birds observed in some Andalusian provinces\\"), by Antonio Machado y Nunez, the public began to appreciate its ecological value for the many different species of wildlife found there. Consequently, it was visited by British naturalists and hunters including Abel Chapman and Walter J. Buck, both of whom wrote books that alerted a wider audience in Europe to the strategic importance of Do√±ana for migratory birds traveling to Africa. Later, when Jos√© Joaqu√≠n √Ålvarez de Toledo y Caro (1865-1915) became the 19th Duke of Medina Sidonia, he inherited large debts and to pay them was forced to sell off various assets, including the Coto de Do√±ana, which he sold for 750,000 pesetas, finally detaching it from the noble house. When the sherry baron William Garvey bought Do√±ana from the Duke in 1901, the estate was abandoned and in a state of ruin. Garvey restored the palace to its former splendor, and upon his death it passed to his brother Joseph and his niece Maria Medina y Garvey, who was married to the Duke of Tarifa, a forest engineer. In 1934 it passed to the sister of the Duchess of Tarifa, Blanca Medina and Garvey, who was married to the Marquis of Borghetto. In 1942, the Marquis sold it to a company formed by Salvador Noguera, Manuel Gonzalez and the Marquis of M√©rito. Fifty years later the park was consolidated as a natural area. Conservation View of Do√±ana National Park from visitors' centre at El Acebuche The Spanish businessman Mauricio Gonz√°lez-Gordon y D√≠ez, Marquis of Bonanza, whose family owned a large estate in Do√±ana, became interested in its ecosystems and their birdlife, and invited ornithologists from all over Europe to visit. In 1952, the Spanish ornithologists Jos√© Antonio Valverde and Francisco Bernis visited the property, with Gonz√°lez-Gordon serving as their guide. Valverde and the Gonz√°lez-Gordon family saw that the wetlands, with their richly diverse wildlife, were threatened by the Spanish government's proposals to drain them for farming and the planting of eucalyptus trees. Mauricio, together with his father, asked Bernis to try and influence Spanish dictator Francisco Franco into abandoning the plans. The trio wrote a memorandum which was presented to Franco himself by Mauricio's father Manuel. By November 1953 Bernis had finished a report on the status of the Do√±ana which showed that the area had exceptional ecological value. The group sought and obtained international support for their goals. The efforts of Gonz√°lez-Gordon to dissuade Franco exposed him to some danger, but the Franco government conceded and the drainage plans were aborted. Valverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts ‚Äì including Guy Monfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann ‚Äìthen demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Do√±ana for development of the Matalasca√±as resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by Gonz√°lez-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Do√±ana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Do√±ana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Do√±ana and other Spanish ecosystems. El Porr√≥n observatory In 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Do√±ana National Park. That same year the Do√±ana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Econom√≠a y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called \\"Preparque Do√±ana\\" was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Do√±ana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Do√±ana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Do√±ana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Do√±ana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Do√±ana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area. Historically, these vital wetlands have been constantly threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. WWF still supports the Do√±ana, and is fighting proposals to drain the marshes and syphon off water for irrigation of agricultural land along the coast and expansion of tourist facilities. In 1998, the Aznalc√≥llar Disaster occurred when a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine owned by Boliden-Apirsa (formerly Andaluza de Piritas, S.A.), the Spanish subsidiary of Boliden, releasing a flood of toxic sludge that entered the River Guadiamar, the main water source for the park. In 2000, after this major environmental catastrophe, the Spanish Ministry of Environment promoted the \\"Do√±ana 2005\\" program, aimed at regenerating the marshes. In 2006 the responsibilities of maintaining the park were transferred to the Government of Andalusia by the Royal Decree of 9 June; the functions and services of the Nature Conservation administration thus transferred to the Andalusian state were widened, and Do√±ana National Park and the Natural Park became the \\"Natural area of Do√±ana\\", a single territory divided into areas with different levels of environmental protection. In 2008 this park was twinned with the Regional Natural Park Camargue in France, with which it shares anthropological and ethnographic aspects. During his tenure, the Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez began using Do√±ana as a vacation retreat, setting a precedent for his successors. In 2010, 9200 hectares of land on the coastline were expropriated by the former Ministry of the Environment for protection. In July 2012, Unesco approved the extension of the Biosphere Reserve of Do√±ana from 77,260 hectares to over 255,000 hectares and enabled compliance with the guidelines of the Man and Biosphere Program. This created a transition zone where the socio-economic interests of the various municipalities in the Do√±ana region are represented. In 2019, the police closed tens of illegal wells operated largely by fruit farmers around the park which had for many years been draining water away from the park's water table. Climate Do√±ana Park has a mild, typically Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and relatively wet winters resulting from variations in the polar front and the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The rainy seasons are intermediate, occurring in spring and in autumn; autumn especially can produce torrential rains caused by the accumulation during the summer of heat in nearby large bodies of water, and the arrival of polar air masses. In winter, however, thermal anticyclones may occur locally. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with maximum temperatures varying about 17 ¬∞C from winter to summer. The most significant feature of the climate is the three to five months of dry weather in the summer, when it is dominated by the subtropical anticyclone. Flora There are many species of flora in the park: trees, including pines, flowers such as roses, and shrubs. Of special interest are the species Vulpia fontquerana, Tursica linaria, Juniperus macrocarpa (maritime juniper), Micropyropsis tuberosa, Hydrocharis morsus-ranae or Thorella verticillatinundata, many of them endangered. Non- native species such as eucalyptus, Acacia longifolia, Gomphocarpus fruticosus, Nicotiana glauca or Carpobrotus edulis (cat's claw) are removed by the park service. Other notable species in the park, of the more than 875 indigenous to the Do√±ana ecosystems are: oleander, oak, the sea wallflower, sweet saltwort, the prickly tumbleweed, marram grass, heather, camarina, lavender, sea holly, reed, carnation, bulrush, common fern, sage-leaved rock rose, rushes, labi√©rnago (Phillyrea angustifolia), sea spurge, mastic, sedge, palm, pine, Scotch broom, rosemary, juniper, gorse, thyme, spurge and blackberries. Flora of the transdunes Dunes in the park The ecosystem of the mobile dunes, also known as transdunes, which are formed by the prevailing south-west wind, is almost nonexistent elsewhere in the Iberian Peninsula. The harshness of this ecosystem is evident in the adaptations made by some plant species to its special conditions: the dunes of sand and soil are inconsistent. The gradual burial of vegetation, especially of trees that emerge then die, killed by the slow movement of sand, is one of the most well-known phenomena in the beach area of the park. Fauna Animals recorded within the park include 20 species of freshwater fish, 10 species of amphibians, 13 species of reptiles, 37 species of mammals and 360 non-marine bird species, of which 127 have bred in the park. Fish Native fish such as eel inhabit Do√±ana as well as introduced species such as carp, and the gambusia, or pike, which is considered an invasive threat to local ecosystems. Reptiles Reptiles found in Do√±ana Park include the European pond turtle, Spanish pond turtle, spur-thighed tortoise, Iberian worm lizard, Bedriaga's skink, western three- toed skink, common wall gecko, spiny-footed lizard, ocellated lizard, Carbonell's wall lizard, Andalusian wall lizard, Psammodromus manuelae, Spanish psammodromus, horseshoe whip snake, ladder snake, southern smooth snake, Montpellier snake, false smooth snake, viperine snake, grass snake, Lataste's viper, loggerhead turtle and leatherback turtle. Birds Purple heron Over 300 species of bird have been recorded in the area, including range-restricted species such as Spanish imperial eagle, marbled teal, white- headed duck and red-knobbed coot. Wetland species include glossy ibis, western swamphen, ferruginous duck, Eurasian spoonbill, red-crested pochard, little and cattle egret, night and squacco heron and greater flamingo, whilst the surrounding areas can have hoopoe, stone-curlew, Spanish sparrow, lesser short-toed lark and pin-tailed sandgrouse. The site also attracts many summer migrants, which can include purple heron, gull-billed tern, greater short-toed lark, short-toed eagle, European roller, western olivaceous warbler, Savi's warbler, little bittern, booted eagle, whiskered tern and rufous scrub robin. Mammals 38 mammal species have been recorded, including twelve species of bat, red deer, European rabbit, European hedgehog, common genet, wildcat, wild boar, Iberian lynx, garden dormouse, Egyptian mongoose, greater white- toothed shrew, Eurasian otter, wood mouse, European polecat, red fox, European badger, Mediterranean pine vole, southwestern water vole and black rat. Iberian lynx, one of the most emblematic species of the park =Iberian lynx= The Iberian lynx, whose habitat is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, is the most endangered of the big cats. Precipitous drops in population counts due to the drastic reduction of fish stocks that are its main food source led to its being declared a protected species in 1966. The only extant colonies of the Iberian lynx are in the Natural Parks of Sierra de Andujar and Cardena, Montoro, and Do√±ana with its surroundings; the other mainland colonies of former times are considered extinct. In Portugal recovery efforts to preserve its remaining habitat have resulted in the creation of the Sierra Malcata Natural Reserve. The Acebuche Breeding Centre in Do√±ana has developed a captive breeding program which has achieved the survival of eleven individuals born in the centre, and of over thirty captured in the park, whose survival was otherwise doubtful. These conservation efforts are threatened by a high mortality rate among the cats and recurring violations of laws prohibiting cars from entering the park or driving on its roads, although, as some agencies have reported, the causes of death are not always clear. The precarious survival situation of this animal has become an emblematic symbol of the park for the general public. =Horses= In Do√±ana there are two indigenous breeds of horse: the marsh horse and the Retuertas horse; the latter is one of the oldest European breeds, dating to perhaps 1000 BC, and the only one living in the wild and isolated from other populations.Free as the wind, old as the hills by: Samantha Kett, Tuesday, August 7, 2007 =Camels= During the 19th and 20th centuries, a herd of feral dromedaries roamed the area. They may have been introduced during the Moorish Conquest of Spain in the 8th century, or they may have escaped from a herd introduced from the Canary Islands in 1829 by the Marquis de Molina as beasts of burden. By the 1950s, there were only eight individuals left, and these were threatened by poachers. By the early 1960s, there were only three, but more were released into the wild after being used in the filming of Lawrence of Arabia in 1962. Natural Park of Do√±ana: Preparque * Abalario‚ÄìAsperillo. The coastal area west of the national park from Matalasca√±as to Mazagon, forming a rectangle 25 km in length and reaching about 5 km inland, consists of a field of dunes, several ancient lagoons and wetlands, as well as a large forest of pine and eucalyptus trees. It shelters abundant wildlife, including the Iberian lynx. This zone includes the towns of Matalasca√±as and Mazagon, as well as the El Arenosillo test Centre, a rocket launch site for suborbital rockets, but its declaration as a national park blocked the construction of a large urban project west of Matalasca√±as. * Preparque Norte‚ÄìPinares de Hinojos (North Preparque Pinewoods of Hinojos) stretches north of the National Park from El Roc√≠o to Hinojos, with areas of marsh and forest. The Pinar del Pinto of Coto del Rey, between Aznalc√°zar and Villamanrique de la Condesa, is home to several species of raptors. * Preparque Este‚ÄìBrazo de la Torre-Entremuros. An area east of the National Park, between Brazo de la Torre and the Guadalquivir, with marshes and ca√±os (tidal channels that reach into the muddy marsh land). It attracts birds that inhabit Do√±ana during the summer and during those winters in which drought occurs. Part of the marshes have been converted to rice cultivation. Pinar de la Algaida * Pinar de la Algaida‚ÄìMarismas de Bonanza. An area southeast of the National Park and north of Sanl√∫car de Barrameda on the left bank of the River Guadalquivir, that includes a large forest of pines and marshes in Salinas. These marshes are the only ones still flooded by the tides (all the others rely solely on freshwater streams and rain for replenishment), and consequently, flamingos and avocets are found in them. \\"Algaida\\" is a word of Arabic origin, meaning generally any place covered with trees and bushes. El Pinar de la Algaida is located near the henarllo, a sanctuary dedicated to the female deity Astarte, and the site of the Roman well of Caveros. Restocking has been practised at Algaida since the early 19th century, and it now contains a large colony of black kites. Environmental Problems After the Aznalc√≥llar Dam disaster of 1998, public awareness of the environmental risks to which the countryside is exposed has increased. Various impact studies and environmental groups have warned repeatedly of problems that threaten the region's flora, fauna, water and soil. While the pressure of urbanization and its various demands on local ecosystems has been a concern throughout the years, this is not the only associated risk factor. UNESCO has reviewed the nomination of the park for inclusion in its \\"List of World Heritage in Danger\\" several times, but has yet to add it. Impact of infrastructure There have been a number of problems related to infrastructure near the park. A project to build an oil pipeline between Extremadura and the port of Huelva has been criticized by environmental groups, who allege it would significantly increase tanker traffic in the area with an associated risk of oil spills. Frequent dredging of the Guadalquivir to allow passage of ships to the port of Seville has been observed to cause serious disturbances in the biodynamics of the estuary. Adena, the Associaci√≥n de defensa de la naturaleza (Association for the defence of nature), the Spanish branch of WWF, has linked the passage of these boats with the introduction of new animals to the local ecosystems, which occurs when they discharge ballast water containing exotic species. The Port of Huelva The Port of Huelva, a few kilometers from the Natural Park, is one of its major environmental threats. Francisco Bella, PSOE senator and former mayor of the town of Almonte Huelva, considers it absurd that the pipeline project has been approved while the national government and the regional government of Andalusia invest in renewable energy. As mayor of Almonte, he noted the difficulties of implementing policies that promote employment near the park: (translation) \\"...we know almost everything about the ant and the lynx, but need to know how employment evolves in Do√±ana.\\" In line with Bella's position regarding the aqueduct, Gin√©s Morata, a biologist and former president of the Consejo de Participaci√≥n de Do√±ana (Participation Council of Do√±ana), says that the project, which involves the passage of hundreds of oil tankers per year that would unload their cargoes near Do√±ana, would lead to an increased possibility of oil spills. Overexploitation of water resources Another environmental problem is water withdrawals for irrigation, many of them illegal, which have doubled since the late 1980s to maintain water- intensive crops such as cotton, rice and more recently strawberries. The latter are grown in greenhouses, with an estimated area under plastic of between 4,500 and 6,000 hectares in the Do√±ana area, producing over 60% of the Spanish strawberry crop. The boring of illegal wells to draw irrigation water from underground aquifers has apparently proliferated, while the water demands of nearby residential complexes and inappropriate usage of the water resources of nearby rivers may also affect the hydrology of the park. Other potential risks include salinization resulting from climate change; the intrusion of salt water from the Atlantic would endanger several animal species. On the other hand, desertification could also occur; recently a transfer from the Chanza-Piedras water system was approved by the Diputaci√≥n de Huelva (Provincial Council of Huelva) to alleviate this eventuality. Impact of agriculture In 2007, the World Wildlife Fund warned that strawberry farms surrounding the park, where 95% of Spanish strawberries were produced, threatened to cause catastrophic damage to the park by depleting the surrounding groundwater, notably where illegal boreholes were involved, as well as creating considerable pesticide pollution and plastic waste which was accumulating in local creeks; AFP further reported that WWF was calling for a boycott of Spanish strawberries,\\"Call for Spain strawberry boycott\\". BBC News, 16/3/07 but this is contradicted by the remarks of a WWF-Spain spokesperson,\\"How the thirst for strawberries is draining Spain's precious water\\". The Independent, 14/2/07: and it is uncharacteristic of WWF to call for blanket boycotts. Aznalc√≥llar disaster On 25 April 1998, a holding dam burst at the Los Frailes mine operated by the mining company, Boliden- Apirsa, near Aznalc√≥llar, Seville Province, releasing 4‚Äì5 million cubic metres of mine tailings. The acidic tailings, which contained dangerous levels of several heavy metals, quickly reached the nearby River Agrio, and then its tributary the River Guadiamar, travelling about 40 kilometres along these waterways before they could be stopped. and advancing as far as the prepark. The cleanup operation took three years, at an estimated cost of ‚Ç¨240 million.. Although the spill was slowed by levees and diverted by way of the Guadalquivir to the sea, the vulnerability of Do√±ana's ecosystems to such environmental catastrophes was evident. To ensure sustainable development both in the countryside and in the surrounding provinces, as well as to counteract future environmental threats, an International Commission of Experts met in 1992 to propose solutions, and produced the Plan de Desarrollo Sostenible de Do√±ana y su Entorno (Plan for Sustainable Development of Do√±ana and its Surroundings), briefly described as: Rice field in Las Marismas, near Isla Mayor This effectively became the mission statement of the Do√±ana 21 Foundation, created in 1997 as a partnership between the Governing Council of the Andalusian Regional Government and the El Monte, San Fernando and Unicaja savings banks. The plan established among its objectives the promotion of actions beneficial to the natural environment, seeking the cooperation of national and European governmental bodies, and the various organizations with an interest in the park, economic or otherwise, for sustainable development of the area (e. g., by encouraging the organic farming of rice). Since then, representatives from Council agencies, businesses, trade unions and conservation organizations such as WWF have joined the foundation and collaborated in meeting its goals. Pipeline In 2013 the construction of a pipeline in the vicinity of the park was authorized by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment. Pilgrimage of El Roc√≠o and ecological issues Wagon bearing a Simpecado (banner with insignia that proceeds images of the Holy Virgin Mary) crosses the Coto Do√±ana on its return from the pilgrimage of El Roc√≠o, in May 2009. The municipality of Almonte, and therefore the park, is situated in an area in which public manifestations of religious fervor have been frequent throughout the centuries. The deities of nature and water were worshiped by the ancient Iberians, as in the goddess cult of Cybele. The cult rituals, similar in many ways to current Rocieras celebrations, were quickly adapted by the early Christians of these lands to be assimilated in their liturgy. They built a small basilica here, now defunct, but it was mainly after the reconquest of the area in 1262 that the Marian devotions were institutionalized. About 1270‚Äì1284, Alfonso X reconstructed the Chapel of St. Mary of Rocinas, and in 1337 Alfonso XI made the first recorded mention of the Marian cult in the area: The image of the Virgin at the Hermitage of El Roc√≠o dates probably from the 13th century, although the current iconography representing the Virgin as a lady of the royal court was adopted in the late 16th century, according to the fashion of the time. The popularity of the cult of the Virgen del Roc√≠o in modern times has raised concerns about the annual pilgrimage's effect on the natural environment of the park. The park is used by pilgrims on their way to the Romer√≠a de El Roc√≠o. As this event attracts a million pilgrims annually, it has a significant negative impact on the park's eco-system. The overcrowding of pilgrims around certain dates is evident not only in the village of El Roc√≠o where the shrine is located, but also in places within and outside the park such as the Piara del Acebuchal, the Ajol√≠ Bridge, Boca del Lobo and the Moguer road. This has been a publicity windfall for the park, but requires stepped-up park resources for fire prevention and general monitoring, and also has had a significant negative environmental impact (e.g., increased danger of wildfires, off-road SUVs damaging sensitive ground, etc.) denounced by environmentalists. Do√±ana Biological Station The Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana (Do√±ana Biological Station) is a centre dedicated to the study of terrestrial ecology. It was created jointly in 1964 by the Spanish government and the World Wildlife Federation to support scientific research on local ecosystems; in the course of this research the status of other national and international ecosystems is also investigated. The EBD, as an administrative and scientific management agency under the aegis of the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas ‚Äì CSIC), operates a research centre in Seville, the Do√±ana Biological Reserve in Almonte, and a Field Station in the Natural Park of Sierras de Cazorla, Segura and Las Villas in the province of Ja√©n. After the World Wildlife Fund was created in 1961, one of its first actions was to acquire 6,794 hectares of the Do√±ana estate 'Las Nuevas' in 1963, which it then turned over to the CSIC. The CSIC declared the area to be a Reserva Biol√≥gica (Biological Reserve) and in 1964 built the Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana. WWF bought another section of Do√±ana in 1968 totaling 3,214 hectares and later called the Reserva Biol√≥gica de Guadiamar (Guadiamar Biological Reserve). Saca de las Yeguas Another important activity of longstanding association with the park is La Saca de las Yeguas (\\"The Gathering of the Mares\\"), a livestock event pertaining to the indigenous wild horses of the salt marshes of Do√±ana. On 26 June, after the Feast of St. John the Baptist is celebrated, mares and new foals among the marisme√±os are gathered in a traditional roundup. Other points of interest Acebr√≥n Palace (Palacio del Acebr√≥n) * Acebr√≥n Palace. It was built in the 1960s by Luis Espinosa Fondevilla as a residence and hunting lodge, and currently serves as the park visitors centre. * Matalasca√±as Dune Park and Marine World Museum. * The Visitors Centre at Acebuche, located in an old farmhouse, is the point of departure for visits to the park. It has trails and bird observatories on the lake of the same name. * Ice House Visitors Centre. Located in Sanlucar de Barrameda in the mariners' barrio (neighborhood) of Bajo de Gu√≠a, this early 20th century former ice house has been repurposed for receiving visitors to Do√±ana National Park. Beside it is the dock for the Real Fernando, a boat that takes visitors up the River Guadalquivir to the town of La Plancha, where can be found marshland cabins and from which you access the Llanos de Vel√°zquez (Vel√°zquez Flats) and Llanos de la Plancha (La Plancha Flats), where there are natural observatories. * Bajo de Gu√≠a Visitors Centre.

A high-occupancy vehicle lane (also known as an HOV lane, carpool lane, diamond lane, 2+ lane, and transit lane or T2 or T3 lanes) is a restricted traffic lane reserved for the exclusive use of vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers, including carpools, vanpools, and transit buses. These restrictions may be only imposed during peak travel times or may apply at all times. According to the criteria used there are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent with concrete barriers; two-directional or reversible; and exclusive, concurrent or contraflow lanes working in peak periods. The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low- emission and other green vehicles, and/or single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll. HOV lanes are normally created to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing traffic congestion and air pollution, Budapest 29‚Äì31 October 2003. although their effectiveness is questionable. Regional and corporate-sponsored vanpools, carpools, and rideshare communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy. For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose. Slugging lines are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the HOV lane. High- occupancy toll lanes (HOT lanes), which allow solo driver vehicles to use HOV lanes on payment of a fee which varies depending on demand, have also been introduced in the United States and Canada. History United States The first freeway HOV facility opened in 1969 in the Shirley Highway in Northern Virginia. As of 2012 the I-95/I-395 HOV facility operates as a two- lane barrier-separated reversible HOV 3+ facility (center lanes) with access through elevated on- and off-ramps. The introduction of HOV lanes in the United States progressed slowly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Major growth occurred from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. The first freeway HOV lane in the United States was implemented in the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway in Northern Virginia, between Washington, DC, and the Capital Beltway, and was opened in 1969 as a bus-only lane. The busway was opened in December 1973 to carpools with four or more occupants, becoming the first instance in which buses and carpools officially shared a HOV lane over a considerable distance. Research funded partly by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and the Bullitt Foundation, pp. 3‚Äì5. In 2005, the two lanes of this HOV 3+ facility carried during the morning peak hour (6:30 am to 9:30 am) a total of 31,700 people in 8,600 vehicles (3.7 persons/veh), while the three or four general-purpose lanes carried 23,500 people in 21,300 vehicles (1.1 persons/veh). Average travel time in the HOV facility was 29 minutes, and 64 minutes in the general traffic lanes. As of 2012, the I-95/I-395 HOV facility is long, extends from Washington, D.C., to Dumfries, Virginia, and has two reversible lanes separated from the regular lanes by barriers, with access through elevated on- and off-ramps. Three or more people in a vehicle (HOV 3+) are required to travel on the facility during rush hours on weekdays. The second freeway HOV facility was the contraflow bus lane on the Lincoln Tunnel Approach and Helix in Hudson County, New Jersey, opened in 1970. Complete account published in Katherine F. Turnbull (1992), \\"HOV Project Case Studies: History and Institutional Arrangements\\" According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the Lincoln Tunnel XBL is the country's HOV facility with the highest number of peak hour persons among HOV facilities with utilization data available, with 23,500 persons in the morning peak, and 62,000 passengers during the four-hour morning peak. See p. 6 The first permanent HOV facility in California was the bypass lane at the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge toll plaza, opened to the public in April 1970. The El Monte Busway (I-10 / San Bernardino Freeway) in Los Angeles was initially only available for buses when it opened in 1973. Three-person carpools were allowed to use the bus lane for three months in 1974 due to a strike by bus operators, and then permanently at a 3+ HOV from 1976. It is one of the most efficient HOV facilities in North America and is currently being converted into a high-occupancy toll lane operation to allow low-occupancy vehicles to bid for excess capacity on the lane in the Metro ExpressLanes project. Beginning in the 1970s, the Urban Mass Transit Administration recognized the advantages of exclusive bus lanes and encouraged their funding. In the 1970s the FHWA began to allow state highway agencies to spend federal funds on HOV lanes. As a result of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, interest in ridesharing picked up, and states began experimenting with HOV lanes. In order to reduce crude oil consumption, the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act mandated maximum speed limits of on public highways and became the first instance when the U.S. federal government provided funding for ridesharing and states were allowed to spend their highway funds on rideshare demonstration projects. The 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act made funding for rideshare initiatives permanent. Also during the early 1970s, ridesharing was recommended for the first time as a tool to mitigate air quality problems. The 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) substantial authority to regulate air quality attainment. A final control plan for the Los Angeles Basin was issued in 1973, and one of its main provisions was a two-phase conversion of of freeway and arterial roadway lanes to bus/carpool lanes and the development of a regional computerized carpool matching system. However, it took until 1985 before any HOV project was constructed in Los Angeles County, and by 1993 there were only of HOV lanes countywide. A significant policy shift took place in October 1990, when a memorandum from the FHWA administrator stated that \\"FHWA strongly supports the objective of HOV preferential facilities and encourages the proper application of HOV technology.\\" Regional administrators were directed to promote HOV lanes and related facilities. Also in the early 1990s, two laws reinforced the U.S. commitment to HOV lane construction. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 included HOV lanes as one of the transportation control measures that could be included in state implementation plans to attain federal air quality standards. The 1990 amendments also deny the administrator of the EPA the authority to block FHWA from funding 24-hour HOV lanes as part of the sanctions for a state's failure to comply with the Clean Air Act, if the secretary of transportation wishes to approve the FHWA funds. On the other hand, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 encouraged the construction of HOV lanes, which were made eligible for Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds in regions not attaining federal air quality standards. CMAQ funds may be spent on new HOV lane construction, even if the HOV designation holds only at peak travel times or in the peak direction. ISTEA also provided that under the Interstate Maintenance Program, only HOV projects would receive the 90% federal matching ratio formerly available for the addition of general purpose lanes. ISTEA, in addition, permitted state authorities to define a high occupancy vehicle as having a minimum of two occupants (HOV 2+). As of 2009, California was the state with the most HOV facilities in the country, with 88, followed by Minnesota with 83 facilities, Washington with 41, Texas with 35, and Virginia with 21. By 2006, HOV lanes in California were operating at two-thirds of their capacity, and these HOV facilities carried on average 2,518 persons per hour during peak hours, substantially more people than the congested general- traffic lanes.I-495 Capital Beltway in the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Area. The facility is located in the median, has two HOV lanes in each direction with elevated on/off ramp access with a total of of lanes. As of October 2016, the longest continuous HOV facility in the U.S. is on I-15 in Utah, extending approximately from Spanish Fork to Layton with a single HOV lane in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes. While the Utah facility is the longest, the I-495 Capital Beltway in the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area extends but has two HOV lanes in each direction for a total of of HOV lanes. As of 2012, there are some 126 HOV facilities on freeways in 27 metropolitan areas in the United States, which includes over 1,000 corridor miles (1,600 km). Canada The HOV lanes on Ontario Highway 404 in Southern Ontario are separated by a striped buffer zone that breaks occasionally to allow vehicles to enter and exit the HOV lane. The first HOV facilities in Canada were opened in Greater Vancouver and Toronto in the early 1990s, followed shortly by facilities in Ottawa, Gatineau, Montreal, and later Calgary. As of 2010 there were about of highway HOV lanes in 11 locations in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and over of arterial HOV lanes in 24 locations in Greater Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and Gatineau. The Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO) in 2006 estimated that commuters in Toronto using the HOV facilities on Highways 403 and 404 were saving 14‚Äì17 minutes per trip compared to their travel time before the HOV lanes opened. The MTO also estimated that almost 40% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 eastbound in the morning peak hour, compared to 14% in 2003, and 37% of commuters were carpooling on Highway 403 westbound in the afternoon peak hour, compared to 22% in 2003. The average rush hour speed on the HOV lanes is , compared to in general-traffic lanes on Highway 403. Temporary HOV lanes were added to selections of 400-series highways in the Greater Toronto Area for the 2015 Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games. Europe As of 2012, there are a few HOV lanes in operation in Europe. The main reason for this is that, in general, European cities have better public transport services and fewer high-capacity multi-lane urban motorways than do the U.S. and Canada. However, at around 1.3 persons per vehicle, average car occupancy is relatively low in most European cities. The emphasis in Europe has been on providing bus lanes and on-street bus priority measures. The first HOV lane in Europe was opened in the Netherlands in October 1993 and operated until August 1994. Its facility was a barrier-separated HOV 3+ on the A1 near Amsterdam. The facility did not attract enough users to overcome public criticism and was converted to a reversible lane open to general traffic after the judge in a legal test case ruled that Dutch traffic law lacked the concept of a car pool and thus that the principle of equality was violated. See Section 3.1 Spain was the next European country to introduce HOV lanes, when median reversible HOV lanes were opened in Madrid's A-6 in 1995. This facility is Europe's oldest HOV facility that is still in operation. The first HOV facility in the United Kingdom opened in Leeds in 1998. The facility was implemented on A647 road near Leeds as an experimental scheme, but it became permanent. The HOV facility is long and operates as a HOV 2+ facility. A HOV 3+ facility opened in Linz, Austria, in 1999. The first HOV lane in Norway was implemented in May 2001 as an HOV 3+ on Elgeseter Street, an undivided four-lane arterial road in Trondheim. This facility was followed by HOV lanes in Oslo and Kristiansand. In France, two bus and taxi only HOV lanes are created in 2015 on the A1 road leading to Paris (initially experimented in 2009) and the A6a road leading to Paris. As of August 2020, several of these bus and taxi lanes exist across France. An experimental signage has been put in place in to allow for electric cars and carpool, but this type of HOV lane has yet to be implemented. New Zealand and Australia The first HOV lane (known as a Transit Lane T2 or T3) in Australia opened in February 1992, located on the Eastern Freeway in Melbourne travelling inbound. In May 2005, T2 Transit lanes were opened on Hoddle Street in Melbourne. As of 2012, there were also T2 and T3 facilities in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane. In Auckland, New Zealand, there are several short HOV 2+ and 3+ lanes throughout the region, commonly known as T2 and T3 lanes. There is a T2 transit lane in Tamaki Drive, in a short stretch between Glendowie and downtown Auckland. There are also T2 priority lanes on Auckland's Northern, Southern, Northwestern, and Southwestern Motorways. These priority lanes are left-side on-ramp lanes heading towards the motorway, where vehicles with two or more people can bypass the ramp meter signal. Priority lanes can also be used by trucks, buses, and motorcycles, and the priority lanes can be used by carpoolers at any time. Eleven lanes were opened to electric vehicles in a one-year trial from September 2017. There are also several short T2 and T3 facilities in North Shore City operating during rush hours. Indonesia In Jakarta, HOV 3+ is known as \\"Three in One\\" (Tiga dalam satu) and was first implemented by governor Sutiyoso. HOV 3+ is implemented on weekdays in existing roads of Sisingamangaraja Road (fast and slow lane), Jalan Jenderal Sudirman (fast and slow lane), Jalan M.H. Thamrin (fast and slow lane), Medan Merdeka Barat Road, Majapahit Road, and sections of Jalan Jenderal Gatot Subroto. The policy was originally implemented only between 7:00 am and 10:00 am. Since the introduction of Jakarta's bus rapid transit in December 2003, the policy was extended to 7:00 am ‚Äì 10:00 am and 4:00 pm ‚Äì 7:00 pm. In September 2004, the evening time was changed to 4:30 pm ‚Äì 7:00 pm. Car jockeys are paid by drivers to ride on vehicles, so that those vehicles would bypass the three in one restriction.Jockeys and Ojeks: More of a Problem Than a Solution  The Jakarta Globe 'Car jockeys' cash in on Jakarta's traffic snarl  News  Mail & Guardian On August 30, 2016 'odd and even' plate number system began to replace \\"3-in-1\\" rule, after trial operation and effective to reduce traffic jams. Odd plate number can enter ex \\"3-in-1\\" area on odd date and even plate number can enter ex \\"3-in-1\\" area on even date. China In Shenzhen, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Binhai Avenue since 25 April 2016. The policy was then extended to 7:30 am ‚Äì 9:30 am and 5:30 pm ‚Äì 9:30 pm. In Chengdu, from January 23, 2017, HOV 2+ has been implemented on Kehua Road South, Kehua Road Middle, and Tianfu Avenue Section 1 and 2, during 7:00 am-9: 00 am and 5:00 pm-7: 00 pm. In Dalian, an expressway (Northeast Expressway, or Dongbei Expressway) linking old town and new town had one lane in both outbound and inbound directions set to HOV 2+. Starting from September 20, 2017, commuters can opt to drive in HOV lane on Northeast Expressway during the morning peak hours of 06:30-08:30, and evening peak hours of 16:30-19:00. A fine of CNY100 (about USD15) will be enforced for first violators. For a second violation, the fine will double. Design and operations An HOV lane on I-24 in Nashville, Tennessee. These lanes function as HOV lanes only on weekdays during rush hour, and as regular lanes the rest of the time. HOV lanes may be either a single traffic lane within the main roadway with distinctive markings or a separate roadway with one or more traffic lanes either parallel to the general lanes or grade-separated, above or below the general lanes. For example, Interstate 110 in California has four HOV lanes on an upper deck. HOV bypass lanes to allow carpool traffic and police to bypass areas of regular congestion in many places and an HOV lane may operate as a reversible lane, working in the direction of the dominant traffic flow in both the morning and the afternoon. All lanes of a section of the Interstate 66 in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., are treated as an HOV during the rush hour in the primary direction of flow. The traffic speed differential between HOV and general- purpose lanes creates a potentially dangerous situation if the HOV lanes are not separated by a barrier. A Texas Transportation Institute study found that HOV lanes lacking barrier separations caused a 50% increase in injury crashes. Variants Business access and transit lane A business access and transit (BAT) lane is a type of HOV lane that allows for all traffic to enter the lane for a short distance in order to access other streets and business entrances. High-occupancy toll lane Because some HOV lanes were not utilized to their full capacity, users of low- or single-occupancy vehicles may be permitted to use an HOV lane if they pay a toll. This scheme is known as high-occupancy toll lane (or HOT lanes), and it has been introduced mainly in the United States. The first practical implementation was California's formerly private toll 91 Express Lanes, in Orange County, California, in 1995, followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 north of San Diego. According to the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute, by 2012 there were 294 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes and 163 corridor-miles of HOT/Express lanes under construction in the United States. See Figure 2, pp.6 FasTrak RFID station in Orange County, California Solo drivers are permitted to use the HOV lanes upon payment of a fee that varies based on demand. Tolls change throughout the day according to real-time traffic conditions, which is intended to manage the number of cars in the lanes to maintain good journey times. Proponents claim that all motorists benefit from HOT lanes, even those who choose not to use them. This argument applies only to projects that increase the total number of lanes. Proponents also claim that HOT lanes provide an incentive to use transit and ridesharing. There has been controversy over this concept, and HOT schemes have been called \\"Lexus\\" lanes, as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk for the rich. HOT tolls are collected by manned toll booths, automatic number plate recognition, or electronic toll collection systems. Some systems use RFID transmitters to monitor entry and exiting of the lane and charge drivers depending on demand. Typically, tolls increase as traffic density and congestion within the tolled lanes increase, a policy known as congestion pricing. The goal of this pricing scheme is to minimize traffic congestion within the lanes. Qualifying vehicles A slugging area, where solo drivers find a passenger to use the HOV Qualification for HOV status varies by scheme, but the following vehicles may be included: * Private cars and taxis with a minimum number of human occupants (often two or three), including babies of any age (but only after birth) * Single-occupant green vehicles, such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and battery electric vehicles * Single-occupancy vehicles upon payment of a variable fee (high-occupancy toll lane only) * Motorcycles  motorcycles are allowed via federal United States HOV lane law (Title 23, Section 166).http://www.nydailynews.com/autos/local-biker-stands-ride-hov-lane- article-1.286236 They cannot use HOV lanes in Ontario unless they have 2 passengers. * Buses designed to transport sixteen or more passengers, including the driver * Public utility vehicles when responding to emergency calls * Bicycles * Police are allowed to use the HOV lanes. New York City HOV lane codes prior to 2008 did not allow motorcycles leading to ticketing of motorcycle drivers and complaints from the American Motorcyclist Association, but have since been revised to comply with the federal regulations listed above. In some jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, taxicabs and airport limousines are allowed to use HOV lanes even when no passenger is present because that vehicle \\"will be able return to duty faster after dropping off a fare or arrive sooner to pick up a fare, thereby moving more people to their destinations in fewer vehicles\\". In Virginia, commuters form sluglines where drivers pick up one or more passengers from a designated \\"slug lines\\" to drive on HOV lanes along interstate 95/395; the driver pulls over near the sluglines and shouts out their destination, and people in the line going to that destination enter the car on a first-come, first-served basis. Compliance, enforcement, and avoidance reversible HOV lanes on Interstate 279 outside Pittsburgh. Fines are usually imposed on drivers of non-qualifying vehicles who use the lanes. Following the introduction of HOVs, some drivers placed inflatable dolls in the passenger seat, a practice that persists today, even though it is now illegal. Cameras that can distinguish between humans and mannequins or dolls were tested in the United Kingdom in 2005. In the United States, law enforcement officials have documented a variety of methods used by drivers in attempts to circumvent HOV occupancy rules: *Placing store mannequins, blow-up dolls, kickboxing dummies, or cardboard cut-outs in the passenger seat; *Taping styrofoam wig stands with wigs or balloons with faces drawn on them to the passenger seat headrest; *Buckling the passenger-side seat belt and pretending to talk to someone reclining in that seat; *Tinting the front windshield and/or lowering the passenger side visor in an effort to obstruct the view into the passenger seat; *Covering an empty infant seat with a blanket and/or placing a doll in it; *Strapping dogs, cats, or other pets into the passenger seat. In early 2006, an Arizona woman asserted that she had been improperly ticketed for using the HOV lane because the unborn child she was carrying in her womb justified her use of the lane, while noting that Arizona traffic laws do not define what constitutes a person. However, a judge subsequently ruled that to qualify as an \\"individual\\" under Arizona traffic laws, the individual must occupy a \\"separate and distinct\\" space in a vehicle. Likewise, in California, in order to use HOV lanes, there must be two (or, if posted, three) separate individuals occupying seats in a vehicle, and an unborn child does not count towards this requirement.Frequently Asked Questions of the Highway Patrol . In 2009 and 2010 it was found that non- compliance rates on HOV lanes in Brisbane, Australia, were approaching 90%. Enhanced enforcement led to increased compliance, average bus journey times dropped by about 19%, and total person throughput increased by 12%. In February 2010, a 61-year-old woman tried to pass off a life-sized mannequin as a passenger in order to use the HOV lane in New York State. A police officer on a routine HOV patrol became suspicious when he noticed that the so-called passenger was wearing sunglasses and using the visor on a cloudy morning. When the officer approached the vehicle, he discovered that the \\"passenger\\" was, in fact, a mannequin wearing lipstick, designer shades, a full-length wig, and a blue sweater. The driver was issued a traffic ticket for using the HOV lane without a human passenger, which carries a fine of $135 in 2010 and two points on a driver's license.Driver Busted Using HOV Lane With Mannequin Passenger, WPIX Newsroom (PIX 11), February 3, 2010. (see also: Driver busted using HOV lane with 'dummy' passenger .Driver Busted Using Carpool Lane With Mannequin, WPIX, February 4, 2010. In January 2013, a motorist tried to claim that the Articles of Incorporation of his business, which had been placed unbuckled on the passenger‚Äôs seat, constituted a person, citing the principle of corporate personhood and California's state Vehicle Code, which defines a person as \\"natural persons and corporations\\". This argument was rejected in traffic court, where the presiding judge commented, \\"Common sense says carrying a sheaf of papers in the front seat does not relieve traffic congestion.\\" In March 2015, a motorist tried to use a cardboard cutout of actor Jonathan Goldsmith to access an HOV lane in Fife, Washington. The officer noted that other drivers had used sleeping bags in earlier attempts to access the HOV lane. Effectiveness According to 2009 data from the U.S. census, 76% drive to work alone and only 10% rideshare. For suburban commuters working in a city, the solo driving rate is 82%. Some underused HOV lanes in several states have been converted to high-occupancy toll lanes (HOT), which offer solo drivers access to HOV lanes after paying a toll. HOV lanes are also an effective way to manage traffic after natural disasters, as seen in New York City after Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. At the time Mayor Bloomberg banned passenger cars with fewer than three occupants from entering Manhattan. The restriction affected all bridges and tunnels entering the city except the George Washington Bridge. Criticism Critics have argued that HOV lanes are underused. It is unclear whether HOV lanes are sufficiently used to compensate for delays in the other mixed-use lanes. Las Vegas, Nevada is a city where its HOV lanes on US-95 have been considered useless and underused due to it being far from a \\"nine-to-five\\" city, but were built because federal funding was earmarked for the project. For the same reason, further criticism was made during the 2009 recession in the decision to build an HOV flyover exit to and from Summerlin Parkway, a freeway that lacked HOV lanes until 2017. The situations have caused social problems in Indonesia, where some people become \\"car jockey\\", people who make their living by offering drivers to fill their car in order to meet the occupancy limit. Reportedly, the situation caused people stay in unemployment for doing so, increased congestion and let parents profit from their babies.http://www.smh.com.au/world/jakartas-jockeys-in- demand-as-gridlock-drives-city-to-despair-20120203-1qxpn.htmlEnd of the road: Jakarta's 'passengers for hire' targeted by carpooling crackdown April 4, 2016 The Guardian Retrieved July 13, 2016Passenger for hire: Dying profession of the Jakarta Jockey April 7, 2016 BBC Retrieved July 13, 2016Jockeys and Ojeks: More of a Problem Than a Solution  The Jakarta Globe Gallery File:MUTCD R3-10.svgStandard restrictive traffic sign in the United States.

He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, it uses a distinctive non-chronological third-person omniscient narration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot. The novel is set during World War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life of antihero Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of Italy, though it also covers episodes from basic training at Lowry Field in Colorado and Air Corps training at Santa Ana Army Air Base in California. The novel examines the absurdity of war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home. The book was made into a film adaptation in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the 1961 novel entitled Closing Time.  Synopsis  The development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1‚Äì11) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944. The second (chapters 12‚Äì20) flashes back to focus primarily on the \\"Great Big Siege of Bologna\\" before once again jumping to the chronological present of 1944 in the third part (chapter 21‚Äì25). The fourth (chapters 26‚Äì28) flashes back to the origins and growth of Milo's syndicate, with the fifth part (chapter 28‚Äì32) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four. The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story's present, but takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general.Clinton S. Burhans, Jr. Spindrift and the Sea: Structural Patterns and Unifying Elements in Catch 22. Twentieth Century Literature, Vol. 19, No. 4, pp. 239‚Äì250, 1973. JSTOR online access Previously the reader had been cushioned from experiencing the full horror of events, but in the final section, the events are laid bare. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair (Doc Daneeka and the Chaplain), disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particular the rape and murder of the innocent young woman, Michaela. In Chapter 41 the full details of the gruesome death of Snowden are finally revealed. Nevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning of Orr's miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.  Style  Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from each iteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect. Much of Heller's prose in Catch-22 is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of a Catch-22. Circular reasoning is widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels in paradox. For example: \\"The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him\\"; and \\"The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with.\\" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book. While a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any \\"minor characters\\". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims. Although its nonchronological structure may at first seem random, Catch-22 is highly structured. It is founded on a structure of free association; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled \\"The Texan\\", ends with \\"everybody but the CID man, who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.\\" Chapter 2, titled \\"Clevinger\\", begins with \\"In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.\\" The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.  Themes   Paradox  Yossarian comes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that \\"they\\" are \\"out to get him\\". The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions, Colonel Cathcart increases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almost jaundice. In Yossarian's words: : The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.  Tragedy and farce  Much of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.  Theodicy  Yossarian questions the idea that God is all- powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he \\"believes in the God he doesn't believe in\\", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage: > \\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways\\", Yossarian continued, > hurtling over her objections. \\"There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's > not working at all. He's playing or else He's forgotten all about us. That's > the kind of God you people talk about‚Äîa country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, > brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you > have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as > phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world > was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He > robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the > world did he ever create pain? ‚Ä¶ Oh, He was really being charitable to us > when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a > doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system > of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. > Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't > He? ‚Ä¶ What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity > and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly > little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost > staggering. ‚Ä¶\\" Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39): > \\"Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled > with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked > through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a > victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must > have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the > midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to > intervene...\\"  Anti-capitalism  While the military's enemies are Germans, none appears in the story as an enemy combatant. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's Mess Officer, Milo Minderbinder, to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates a military‚Äìindustrial complex. Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without \\"evil intent.\\" Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.  Characters   Influences  Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as a bombardier during World War II inspired Catch-22; Heller later said that he \\"never had a bad officer\\". In a 1977 essay on Catch-22, Heller stated that the \\"antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book\\" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War and McCarthyism. The influence of the 1950s on Catch-22 is evident through Heller's extensive use of anachronism. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms like loyalty oaths and computers (IBM machines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s. Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s: * Milo Minderbinder's maxim \\"What's good for M&M; Enterprises is good for the country\\" alludes to the former president of General Motors Charles Erwin Wilson's statement before the Senate: \\"What's good for General Motors is good for the country.\\" * The question of \\"Who promoted Major Major?\\" alludes to Joseph McCarthy's questioning of the promotion of Major Peress, an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths. Czech writer Arno≈°t Lustig recounts in his book 3x18 that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have written Catch-22 had he not first read The Good Soldier ≈†vejk by Jaroslav Ha≈°ek. In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities to Louis Falstein's 1950 novel, Face of a Hero. Falstein never raised the issue between Catch-22's publication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced by C√©line, Waugh and Nabokov. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.  Concept  A \\"Catch-22\\" is \\"a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule.\\"catch-22, Merriam-Webster. Retrieved March 8, 2012 http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/catch%2022 For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them ‚Äî a Catch-22. The term \\"Catch-22\\" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation. In the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifying bureaucratic operation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains: > There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a > concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate > was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All > he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and > would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and > sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them > he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and > had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this > clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5) Other forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: \\"Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating.\\" Another character explains: \\"Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.\\" Yossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs. The motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994's Closing Time, Heller's sequel to Catch-22. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters in Catch-22, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.  Literary allusions  Catch-22 contains allusions to many works of literature. Howard Jacobson, in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was \\"positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites ‚Äì between Shakespeare and Rabelais and Dickens and Dostoevsky and Gogol and C√©line and the Absurdists and of course Kafka on the one hand, and on the other vaudeville and slapstick and Bilko and Abbott and Costello and Tom and Jerry and the Goons (if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).\\"Random House Vintage Classics One critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel: \\"Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare ‚Äì in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.\\"McDonald, Paul. Reading Catch-22. Humanities E-Books  Historical context  The idea for Catch-22 was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber pilots felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers and loyalty oaths. The war experience turned Heller into a \\"tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being\\". After publication in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. Catch-22 seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and author John W. Aldridge wrote a piece in The New York Times celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing of \\"Catch-22\\". He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come: > The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a > reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world > in which we live and hope to survive. Although Catch-22 is considered by many to be an anti-war novel, Heller stated in a talk he gave at the New York Public Library on August 31, 1998 that he and the other men he knew in World War II considered the war to be \\"noble\\" and \\"nobody really objected to fighting it\\". The anti-war reputation of the novel was fueled instead by the pacifist, anti-war ethos among young Americans surrounding the Vietnam War.  Title  The title is a reference to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation which embodies forms of illogical and immoral reasoning. The opening chapter of the novel was originally published in New World Writing as Catch-18 in 1955, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, requested that he change the title of the novel, so it would not be confused with another recently published World War II novel, Leon Uris's Mila 18. The number 18 has special meaning in Judaism (it refers to chai, meaning \\"alive\\", in Gematria), and was relevant to early drafts of the novel, which had a somewhat greater emphasis on Jewish themes in the novel.N James. \\"The Early Composition History of Catch-22\\". In Biographies of Books: The Compositional Histories of Notable American Writings, J Barbour, T Quirk (edi.) pp. 262‚Äì290. Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1996. The title Catch-11 was suggested, with the duplicated 1 paralleling the repetition found in a number of character exchanges in the novel, but because of the release of the 1960 movie Ocean's Eleven, this was also rejected. Catch-17 was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II film Stalag 17, as was Catch-14, apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a \\"funny number\\". Eventually, the title came to be Catch-22, which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number of d√©j√† vu-like events common in the novel.  Publication and movie rights  Catch-22 was sold to Simon & Schuster, where it had been championed by editor Robert Gottlieb, who, along with Nina Bourne, would edit and oversee the marketing of the book. Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along with Peter Schwed and Justin Kaplan. Henry Simon, a vice president at Simon & Schuster, found it repetitive and offensive. The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions; he signed for . Officially published on October 10, 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though twelve thousand copies were sold by Thanksgiving, it never entered the New York Times Bestseller List. It received good notices and was nominated for the National Book Award in March 1962, though Walker Percy's The Moviegoer won. Catch-22 went through four printings in hardcover but sold well on only the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents. Upon publication in Great Britain, the book became the #1 best-seller. Don Fine of Dell Paperbacks bought the paperback reprint rights to Catch-22 for $32,000. Between the paperback's release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1 million copies. In August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights to Columbia Pictures for $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay.  Reception  The initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews from The Nation (\\"the best novel to come out in years\\"), the New York Herald Tribune (\\"A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book\\") and The New York Times (\\"A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights\\"). On the other hand, The New Yorker (\\"doesn't even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper\\", \\"what remains is a debris of sour jokes\\") and a second review from the New York Times (\\"repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest\\") disliked it. One commentator of Catch-22 recognized that \\"many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it\\". The book had a cult following though, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller remarks that in 1962, after appearing on the Today show he went out drinking with the host at the time, John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading \\"YOSSARIAN LIVES\\". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building. Although the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century. Scholar and fellow World War II veteran Hugh Nibley said it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military.Hugh Nibley and Alex Nibley, Sergeant Nibley PhD.: Memories of an Unlikely Screaming Eagle, Salt Lake City: Shadow Mountain, 2006, p. 255 ten million copies have been sold. Although he continued writing, including a sequel novel Closing Time, Heller's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success of Catch-22. When asked by critics why he'd never managed to write another novel as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, \\"Who has?\\"  Rankings  * The Modern Library ranked Catch-22 as the 7th (by review panel) and 12th (by public) greatest English-language novel of the 20th century.Randomhouse.com Modern Library's 100 best novels of the 20th century * The Radcliffe Publishing Course rank Catch-22 as number 15 of the 20th century's top 100 novels. * The Observer listed Catch-22 as one of the 100 greatest novels of all time. * TIME puts Catch-22 in the top 100 English- language modern novels (1923 onwards, unranked). * The Big Read by the BBC ranked Catch-22 as number 11 on a web poll of the UK's best-loved book.The BBC's Big Read  Adaptations  Opening title of the film adaptation * Catch-22 was adapted into a feature film of the same name in 1970, directed by Mike Nichols.

The first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents. Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is presented as an autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer) ‚Äì a castaway who spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near the coasts of Venezuela and Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers, before ultimately being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called \\"M√°s a Tierra\\", now part of Chile, which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. Despite its simple narrative style, Robinson Crusoe was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. It is generally seen as a contender for the first English novel. Before the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television, and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade. Plot summary Pictorial map of Crusoe's island, the \\"Island of Despair\\", showing incidents from the book Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name \\"Kreutznaer\\") set sail from Kingston upon Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his lust for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, as the ship is taken over by Sal√© pirates (the Sal√© Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation. Years later, Crusoe joins an expedition to bring slaves from Africa, but he is shipwrecked in a storm about forty miles out to sea on an island near the Venezuelan coast (which he calls the Island of Despair) near the mouth of the Orinoco river on 30 September 1659. He observes the latitude as 9 degrees and 22 minutes north. He sees penguins and seals on his island. As for his arrival there, only he and three animals, the captain's dog and two cats, survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar. By using tools salvaged from the ship, and some which he makes himself, he hunts, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society. More years pass and Crusoe discovers native cannibals, who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat prisoners. At first he plans to kill them for committing an abomination but later realizes he has no right to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. He dreams of obtaining one or two servants by freeing some prisoners; when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new companion \\"Friday\\" after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe then teaches him English and converts him to Christianity. After more natives arrive to partake in a cannibal feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of the natives and save two prisoners. One is Friday's father and the other is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday's father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port. Before the Spaniards return, an English ship appears; mutineers have commandeered the vessel and intend to maroon their captain on the island. Crusoe and the ship's captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship. With their ringleader executed by the captain, the mutineers take up Crusoe's offer to be marooned on the island rather than being returned to England as prisoners to be hanged. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers how he survived on the island and states that there will be more men coming. Crusoe leaves the island 19 December 1686 and arrives in England on 11 June 1687. He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father's will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England from Portugal to avoid traveling by sea. Friday accompanies him and, en route, they endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing the Pyrenees.

Religion Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719 during the Enlightenment period of the 18th century. In the novel Crusoe sheds light on different aspects of Christianity and his beliefs. The book can be considered a spiritual autobiography as Crusoe's views on religion drastically change from the start of his story and then the end. In the beginning of the book Crusoe is concerned with sailing away from home, whereupon he meets violent storms at sea. He promises to God that if he survived that storm he would be a dutiful Christian man and head home according to his parent's wishes. However, when Crusoe survives the storm he decides to keep sailing and notes that he could not fulfil the promises he had made during his turmoil. After Robinson is shipwrecked on his island he begins to suffer from extreme isolation. He turns to his animals to talk to, such as his parrot, but misses human contact. He turns to God during his time of turmoil in search of solace and guidance. He retrieves a Bible from a ship that was washed along the shore and begins to memorize verses. In times of trouble he would open the Bible to a random page where he would read a verse that he believed God had made him open and read, and that would ease his mind. Therefore, during the time in which Crusoe was shipwrecked he became very religious and often would turn to God for help. When Crusoe meets his servant Friday, he begins to teach him scripture and about Christianity. He tries to teach Friday to the best of his ability about God and what Heaven and Hell are. His purpose is to convert Friday into being a Christian and to his values and beliefs. ‚ÄúDuring the long time that Friday has now been with me, and that he began to speak to me, and understand me, I was not wanting to lay a foundation of religious knowledge in his mind; particularly I ask'd him one time who made him?‚Äù Sources and real-life castaways Statue of Robinson Crusoe at Alexander Selkirk's birthplace of Lower Largo by Thomas Stuart Burnett Book on Alexander Selkirk There were many stories of real-life castaways in Defoe's time. Most famously, Defoe's suspected inspiration for Robinson Crusoe is thought to be Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who spent four years on the uninhabited island of M√°s a Tierra (renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966) in the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands off the Chilean coast. Selkirk was rescued in 1709 by Woodes Rogers during an English expedition that led to the publication of Selkirk's adventures in both A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World and A Cruising Voyage Around the World in 1712. According to Tim Severin, \\"Daniel Defoe, a secretive man, neither confirmed or denied that Selkirk was the model for the hero of his book. Apparently written in six months or less, Robinson Crusoe was a publishing phenomenon. The author of Crusoe's Island, Andrew Lambert states, \\"the ideas that a single, real Crusoe is a 'false premise' because Crusoe's story is a complex compound of all the other buccaneer survival stories.\\" However, Robinson Crusoe is far from a copy of Rogers' account: Becky Little argues three events that distinguish the two stories: # Robinson Crusoe was shipwrecked while Selkirk decided to leave his ship thus marooning himself; # the island Crusoe was shipwrecked on had already been inhabited, unlike the solitary nature of Selkirk's adventures. # The last and most crucial difference between the two stories is Selkirk was a privateer, looting and raiding coastal cities during the War of Spanish Succession. \\"The economic and dynamic thrust of the book is completely alien to what the buccaneers are doing,\\" Lambert says. \\"The buccaneers just want to capture some loot and come home and drink it all, and Crusoe isn‚Äôt doing that at all. He's an economic imperialist: He's creating a world of trade and profit.\\" Other possible sources for the narrative include Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, and Spanish sixteenth-century sailor Pedro Serrano. Ibn Tufail's Hayy ibn Yaqdhan is a twelfth-century philosophical novel also set on a desert island, and translated from Arabic into Latin and English a number of times in the half- century preceding Defoe's novel. Pedro Luis Serrano was a Spanish sailor who was marooned for seven or eight years on a small desert island after shipwrecking in the 1520s on a small island in the Caribbean off the coast of Nicaragua. He had no access to fresh water and lived off the blood and flesh of sea turtles and birds. He was quite a celebrity when he returned to Europe; before passing away, he recorded the hardships suffered in documents that show the endless anguish and suffering, the product of absolute abandonment to his fate, now held in the General Archive of the Indies, in Seville. It is very likely that Defoe heard his story in one of his visits to Spain before becoming a writer; by then the tale was 200 years old, but still very popular. Yet another source for Defoe's novel may have been the Robert Knox account of his abduction by the King of Ceylon Rajasinha II of Kandy in 1659 in An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon.see Alan Filreis Severin (2002) unravels a much wider, and more plausible range of potential sources of inspiration, and concludes by identifying castaway surgeon Henry Pitman as the most likely: :An employee of the Duke of Monmouth, Pitman played a part in the Monmouth Rebellion. His short book about his desperate escape from a Caribbean penal colony, followed by his shipwrecking and subsequent desert island misadventures, was published by John Taylor of Paternoster Row, London, whose son William Taylor later published Defoe's novel. Severin argues that since Pitman appears to have lived in the lodgings above the father's publishing house and that Defoe himself was a mercer in the area at the time, Defoe may have met Pitman in person and learned of his experiences first-hand, or possibly through submission of a draft. Severin also discusses another publicised case of a marooned man named only as Will, of the Miskito people of Central America, who may have led to the depiction of Friday. Secord (1963) analyses the composition of Robinson Crusoe and gives a list of possible sources of the story, rejecting the common theory that the story of Selkirk is Defoe's only source. Reception and sequels Plaque in Queen's Gardens, Hull, showing him on his island The book was published on 25 April 1719. Before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions. By the end of the nineteenth century, no book in the history of Western literature had more editions, spin-offs, and translations (even into languages such as Inuktitut, Coptic, and Maltese) than Robinson Crusoe, with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children's versions with pictures and no text. The term \\"Robinsonade\\" was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to Robinson Crusoe. Defoe went on to write a lesser-known sequel, The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1719). It was intended to be the last part of his stories, according to the original title page of the sequel's first edition, but a third book was published (1720) Serious Reflections During the Life and Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe: With his Vision of the Angelick World.  Interpretations  Friday after he frees him from the cannibals Novelist James Joyce noted that the true symbol of the British Empire is Robinson Crusoe, to whom he ascribed stereotypical and somewhat hostile English racial characteristics: > \\"He is the true prototype of the British colonist. ... The whole Anglo-Saxon > spirit in Crusoe: the manly independence, the unconscious cruelty, the > persistence, the slow yet efficient intelligence, the sexual apathy, the > calculating taciturnity.\\" In a sense Crusoe attempts to replicate his society on the island. This is achieved through the use of European technology, agriculture and even a rudimentary political hierarchy. Several times in the novel Crusoe refers to himself as the \\"king\\" of the island, whilst the captain describes him as the \\"governor\\" to the mutineers. At the very end of the novel the island is explicitly referred to as a \\"colony\\". The idealised master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday can also be seen in terms of cultural imperialism. Crusoe represents the \\"enlightened\\" European whilst Friday is the \\"savage\\" who can only be redeemed from his barbarous way of life through assimilation into Crusoe's culture. Nonetheless Defoe also takes the opportunity to criticise the historic Spanish conquest of South America. According to J.P. Hunter, Robinson is not a hero but an everyman. He begins as a wanderer, aimless on a sea he does not understand, and ends as a pilgrim, crossing a final mountain to enter the promised land. The book tells the story of how Robinson becomes closer to God, not through listening to sermons in a church but through spending time alone amongst nature with only a Bible to read. Conversely, cultural critic and literary scholar Michael Gurnow views the novel from a Rousseauian perspective: The central character's movement from a primitive state to a more civilized one is interpreted as Crusoe's denial of humanity's state of nature. Robinson Crusoe is filled with religious aspects. Defoe was a Puritan moralist and normally worked in the guide tradition, writing books on how to be a good Puritan Christian, such as The New Family Instructor (1727) and Religious Courtship (1722). While Robinson Crusoe is far more than a guide, it shares many of the themes and theological and moral points of view. \\"Crusoe\\" may have been taken from Timothy Cruso, a classmate of Defoe's who had written guide books, including God the Guide of Youth (1695), before dying at an early age ‚Äì just eight years before Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe. Cruso would have been remembered by contemporaries and the association with guide books is clear. It has even been speculated that God the Guide of Youth inspired Robinson Crusoe because of a number of passages in that work that are closely tied to the novel. A leitmotif of the novel is the Christian notion of providence, penitence, and redemption. Crusoe comes to repent of the follies of his youth. Defoe also foregrounds this theme by arranging highly significant events in the novel to occur on Crusoe's birthday. The denouement culminates not only in Crusoe's deliverance from the island, but his spiritual deliverance, his acceptance of Christian doctrine, and in his intuition of his own salvation. When confronted with the cannibals, Crusoe wrestles with the problem of cultural relativism. Despite his disgust, he feels unjustified in holding the natives morally responsible for a practice so deeply ingrained in their culture. Nevertheless, he retains his belief in an absolute standard of morality; he regards cannibalism as a \\"national crime\\" and forbids Friday from practising it. In classical, neoclassical and Austrian economics, Crusoe is regularly used to illustrate the theory of production and choice in the absence of trade, money, and prices. Crusoe must allocate effort between production and leisure and must choose between alternative production possibilities to meet his needs. The arrival of Friday is then used to illustrate the possibility of trade and the gains that result. The work has been variously read as an allegory for the development of civilisation; as a manifesto of economic individualism; and as an expression of European colonial desires. Significantly, it also shows the importance of repentance and illustrates the strength of Defoe's religious convictions. Critic M.E. Novak supports the connection between the religious and economic themes within Robinson Crusoe, citing Defoe's religious ideology as the influence for his portrayal of Crusoe's economic ideals, and his support of the individual. Novak cites Ian Watt's extensive researchwhich explores the impact that several Romantic Era novels had against economic individualism, and the reversal of those ideals that takes place within Robinson Crusoe. In Tess Lewis's review, \\"The heroes we deserve\\", of Ian Watt's article, she furthers Watt's argument with a development on Defoe's intention as an author, \\"to use individualism to signify nonconformity in religion and the admirable qualities of self-reliance\\". This further supports the belief that Defoe used aspects of spiritual autobiography in order to introduce the benefits of individualism to a not entirely convinced religious community. J. Paul Hunter has written extensively on the subject of Robinson Crusoe as apparent spiritual autobiography, tracing the influence of Defoe's Puritan ideology through Crusoe's narrative, and his acknowledgement of human imperfection in pursuit of meaningful spiritual engagements ‚Äì the cycle of \\"repentance [and] deliverance.\\" This spiritual pattern and its episodic nature, as well as the re-discovery of earlier female novelists, have kept Robinson Crusoe from being classified as a novel, let alone the first novel written in English ‚Äì despite the blurbs on some book covers. Early critics, such as Robert Louis Stevenson, admired it, saying that the footprint scene in Crusoe was one of the four greatest in English literature and most unforgettable; more prosaically, Wesley Vernon has seen the origins of forensic podiatry in this episode. It has inspired a new genre, the Robinsonade, as works such as Johann David Wyss' The Swiss Family Robinson (1812) adapt its premise and has provoked modern postcolonial responses, including J. M. Coetzee's Foe (1986) and Michel Tournier's Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique (in English, Friday, or, The Other Island) (1967). Two sequels followed: Defoe's The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1719) and his Serious reflections during the life and surprising adventures of Robinson Crusoe: with his Vision of the angelick world (1720). Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) is in part a parody of Defoe's adventure novel. Legacy Influence on language The book proved so popular that the names of the two main protagonists have entered the language. During World War II, people who decided to stay and hide in the ruins of the German-occupied city of Warsaw for a period of three winter months, from October to January 1945, when they were rescued by the Red Army, were later called Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw (Robinsonowie warszawscy). Robinson Crusoe usually referred to his servant as \\"my man Friday\\", from which the term \\"Man Friday\\" (or \\"Girl Friday\\") originated. Influence on literature Robinson Crusoe marked the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. Its success led to many imitators, and castaway novels, written by Ambrose Evans, Penelope Aubin, and others, became quite popular in Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these have fallen into obscurity, but some became established, including The Swiss Family Robinson, which borrowed Crusoe's first name for its title. Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, published seven years after Robinson Crusoe, may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man, Warren Montag argues that Swift was concerned about refuting the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. In Treasure Island, author Robert Louis Stevenson parodies Crusoe with the character of Ben Gunn, a friendly castaway who was marooned for many years, has a wild appearance, dresses entirely in goat skin, and constantly talks about providence. In Jean-Jacques Rousseau's treatise on education, Emile, or on Education, the one book the protagonist is allowed to read before the age of twelve is Robinson Crusoe. Rousseau wants Emile to identify himself as Crusoe so he can rely upon himself for all of his needs. In Rousseau's view, Emile needs to imitate Crusoe's experience, allowing necessity to determine what is to be learned and accomplished. This is one of the main themes of Rousseau's educational model. Robinson Crusoe bookstore on ƒ∞stiklal Avenue, Istanbul In The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, Beatrix Potter directs the reader to Robinson Crusoe for a detailed description of the island (the land of the Bong tree) to which her eponymous hero moves. In Wilkie Collins' most popular novel, The Moonstone, one of the chief characters and narrators, Gabriel Betteredge, has faith in all that Robinson Crusoe says and uses the book for a sort of divination. He considers The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe the finest book ever written, reads it over and over again, and considers a man but poorly read if he had happened not to read the book. French novelist Michel Tournier published Friday, or, The Other Island (French Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique) in 1967. His novel explores themes including civilization versus nature, the psychology of solitude, as well as death and sexuality in a retelling of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe story. Tournier's Robinson chooses to remain on the island, rejecting civilization when offered the chance to escape 28 years after being shipwrecked. Likewise, in 1963, J. M. G. Le Cl√©zio, winner of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Literature, published the novel Le Proces- Verbal. The book's epigraph is a quote from Robinson Crusoe, and like Crusoe, the novel's protagonist Adam Pollo suffers long periods of loneliness. \\"Crusoe in England\\", a 183 line poem by Elizabeth Bishop, imagines Crusoe near the end of his life, recalling his time of exile with a mixture of bemusement and regret. J. M. Coetzee's 1986 novel Foe recounts the tale of Robinson Crusoe from the perspective of a woman named Susan Barton. Comics adaptations The story was also illustrated and published in comic book form by Classics Illustrated in 1943 and 1957. The much improved 1957 version was inked / penciled by Sam Citron, who is most well known for his contributions to the earlier issues of Superman. British illustrator Reginald Ben Davis drew a female version of the story titled Jill Crusoe, Castaway (1950-1959). Stage adaptations A pantomime version of Robinson Crusoe was staged at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1796, with Joseph Grimaldi as Pierrot in the harlequinade. The piece was produced again in 1798, this time starring Grimaldi as Clown. In 1815, Grimaldi played Friday in another version of Robinson Crusoe.Findlater, pp. 60, 76; Grimaldi (box edition), pp. 184‚Äì185, 193; and McConnell Stott, p. 101 Jacques Offenbach wrote an op√©ra comique called Robinson Cruso√©, which was first performed at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris on 23nbsp;November 1867. This was based on the British pantomime version rather than the novel itself. The libretto was by Eug√®ne Cormon and Hector- Jonathan Cr√©mieux. There have been a number of other stage adaptations, including those by Isaac Pocock, Jim Helsinger and Steve Shaw and a musical by Victor Prince. Film adaptations There is a 1927 silent film titled Robinson Crusoe. The Soviet 3D film Robinson Crusoe was produced in 1947. Luis Bu√±uel directed Adventures of Robinson Crusoe starring Dan O'Herlihy, released in 1954. Walt Disney later comedicized the novel with Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N., featuring Dick Van Dyke. In this version, Friday became a beautiful woman, but named 'Wednesday' instead. Peter O'Toole and Richard Roundtree co- starred in a 1975 film Man Friday which sardonically portrayed Crusoe as incapable of seeing his dark-skinned companion as anything but an inferior creature, while Friday is more enlightened and sympathetic. In 1988, Aidan Quinn portrayed Robinson Crusoe in the film Crusoe. A 1997 movie entitled Robinson Crusoe starred Pierce Brosnan and received limited commercial success. Variations on the theme include the 1954 Miss Robin Crusoe, with a female castaway, played by Amanda Blake, and a female Friday, and the 1964 film Robinson Crusoe on Mars, starring Paul Mantee, with an alien Friday portrayed by Victor Lundin and an added character played by Adam West. The 2000 film Cast Away, with Tom Hanks as a FedEx employee stranded on an island for many years, also borrows much from the Robinson Crusoe story. In 1964 a French film production crew made a 13 part serial of The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. It starred Robert Hoffmann. The black and white series was dubbed into English and German. In the UK, the BBC broadcast it on numerous occasions between 1965 and 1977. In 1981 Czechoslovakian director and animator Stanislav L√°tal made a version of the story under the name Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a Sailor from York combining traditional and stop-motion animation. The movie was coproduced by regional West Germany broadcaster S√ºdwestfunk Baden-Baden. Animated adaptations In 1988, an animated cartoon for children called Classic Adventure Stories Robinson Crusoe was released. Crusoe's early sea travels are simplified, as his ship outruns the Sal√© Rovers pirates but then gets wrecked in a storm. TV adaptations Two 2000s reality television series, Expedition Robinson and Survivor, have their contestants try to survive on an isolated location, usually an island. The concept is influenced by Robinson Crusoe.  Inverted Crusoeism  The term inverted Crusoeism is coined by J. G. Ballard. The paradigm of Robinson Crusoe has been a recurring topic in Ballard‚Äôs work. Whereas the original Robinson Crusoe became a castaway against his own will, Ballard's protagonists often choose to maroon themselves; hence inverted Crusoeism (e.g., Concrete Island). The concept provides a reason as to why people would deliberately maroon themselves on a remote island; in Ballard‚Äôs work, becoming a castaway is as much a healing and empowering process as an entrapping one, enabling people to discover a more meaningful and vital existence. Musical references Musician Dean briefly mentions Crusoe in one of his music videos. In the official music video for Instagram, there is a part when viewers hear Dean's distorted voice; \\"Sometimes, I feel alone ... I feel like I'm Robinson Crusoe ...\\" Robinson Crusoe is also mentioned in the song \\"I'm a Dog\\" by Canadian band Crash Test Dummies. Written from the perspective of a dog puzzling over human philosophy, the song has this stanza: ::There's some debate about whether instincts should be held in check ::Well, I suppose that I'm a liberal in this respect ::I can't say I liked Robinson Crusoe ::But at least he didn't tie his dogs up at night Editions * The life and strange surprizing adventures of Robinson Crusoe: of York, mariner: who lived twenty eight years all alone in an un-inhabited island on the coast of America, near the mouth of the great river of Oroonoque; ...

He signed his cartoons Chas Addams. Some of the recurring characters, who became known as the Addams Family, have been the basis for spin-offs in several other forms of media. Biography Life Addams was born in Westfield, New Jersey. The son of Grace M. (n√©e Spear; 1879‚Äì1960) and Charles Huey Addams (1882‚Äì1963), a piano company executive who had studied to be an architect, he was known as \\"something of a rascal around the neighborhood\\" as childhood friends recalled. Addams was distantly related to U.S. presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, despite the different spellings of their last names, and was a first cousin twice removed to noted social reformer Jane Addams, as well as Emmy Award-winning producer John Addams Harper. A house on Elm Street, and another on Dudley Avenue into which police once caught him breaking and entering, are said to be the inspiration for the Addams Family mansion in his cartoons. College Hall, the oldest building on the current campus of the University of Pennsylvania, where Addams studied, was also an inspiration for the mansion. He was fond of visiting the Presbyterian Cemetery on Mountain Avenue. One friend said of him: \\"His sense of humor was a little different from everybody else's.\\" He was also artistically inclined, \\"drawing with a happy vengeance,\\" according to a biographer. His father encouraged him to draw, and Addams did cartoons for the Westfield High School student literary magazine, Weathervane. He attended Colgate University in 1929 and 1930. At the corners of West Kendrick and Maple Avenues in Hamilton, is another home, and myth, that may have inspired the Addams Family house. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania, where a fine-arts building on campus is named for him, in 1930 and 1931. In front of the building is a sculpture of the silhouettes of Addams Family characters, while the library at Penn State contains a mural which he created in 1952 and depicts prominent Addams Family members.Sketchbook by Charles Addams: The Addams Family Secret He then studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City in 1931 and 1932. In 1933, Charles Addams joined the layout department of True Detective magazine, where he had to retouch photos of corpses that appeared in the magazine's stories to remove the blood from them. Addams complained: \\"A lot of those corpses were more interesting the way they were.\\" Addams' first drawing for The New Yorker, a sketch of a window washer, ran on February 6, 1932, and his cartoons ran regularly in the magazine from 1937, when he drew the first in the series that came to be called The Addams Family, until his death. He was a freelancer throughout that time. During World War II, Addams served at the Signal Corps Photographic Center in New York, where he made animated training films for the U.S. Army. In late 1942, he met his first wife, Barbara Jean Day, who purportedly resembled his cartoon character Morticia Addams. The marriage ended eight years later, after Addams, who hated small children, refused to adopt one. She later married New Yorker colleague John Hersey, author of the book Hiroshima. Addams married his second wife, Barbara Barb (Estelle B. Barb), in 1954. A practicing lawyer, she \\"combined Morticia-like looks with diabolical legal scheming,\\" by which she wound up controlling The Addams Family television and film franchises and persuaded her husband to give away other legal rights. At one point, she got her husband to take out a US $100,000 insurance policy. Addams consulted a lawyer on the sly, who later humorously wrote: \\"I told him the last time I had word of such a move was in a picture called Double Indemnity starring Barbara Stanwyck, which I called to his attention.\\" In the movie, Stanwyck's character plotted her husband's murder. The couple divorced in 1956. The Addams Family television series began after David Levy,\\"David Levy; Producer Created Addams Family\\" , Los Angeles Times, 31 January 2000 a television producer, approached Addams with an offer to create it with a little help from the humorist. All Addams had to do was give his characters names and more characteristics for the actors to use in portrayals. The series ran on ABC for two seasons, from 1964 to 1966. Addams was \\"sociable and debonair\\". A biographer described him as being \\"a well- dressed, courtly man with silvery back-combed hair and a gentle manner, he bore no resemblance to a fiend\\". Figuratively a \\"ladykiller\\", Addams accompanied women such as Greta Garbo, Joan Fontaine and Jacqueline Kennedy on social occasions. Later, Addams married his third and final wife, Marilyn Matthews Miller, best known as \\"Tee\\" (1926-2002), in a pet cemetery. In 1985, the Addamses moved to Sagaponack, New York, where they named their estate \\"The Swamp\\". Death Addams died on September 29, 1988, at the age of 76, at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in New York City, having suffered a heart attack after parking his automobile. An ambulance took him from his apartment to the hospital, where he died in the emergency room. As he had requested, a wake was held rather than a funeral; he had wished to be remembered as a \\"good cartoonist\\". In accordance with Addams' wishes, he was cremated, and his ashes were interred in the pet cemetery of his estate \\"The Swamp\\". Cartoons Addams' cartoons regularly appeared in The New Yorker, and he also created a syndicated single-panel comic, Out of This World, which ran 1955-1957. There are many collections of his work, including Drawn and Quartered (1942) and Monster Rally (1950), the latter with a foreword by John O'Hara. Typical of Addams' work, one cartoon shows two men standing in a room labeled \\"Patent Attorney\\". One is pointing a bizarre gun out the window toward the street and saying: \\"Death ray, fiddlesticks! Why, it doesn't even slow them up!\\". Dear Dead Days (1959) is not a collection of his cartoons (although it reprints a few from previous collections); it is a scrapbook-like compendium of vintage images (and occasional pieces of text) that appealed to Addams' sense of the grotesque, including Victorian woodcuts, vintage medicine-show advertisements, and a boyhood photograph of Francesco Lentini, who had three legs. Addams drew more than 1,300 cartoons over the course of his life. Those that did not appear in The New Yorker were often in Collier's and TV Guide. In 1961, Addams received, from the Mystery Writers of America, a Special Edgar Award for his body of work. His cartoons appeared in books, calendars, and other merchandising. Singer-guitarist Dean Gitter's 1957 recording Ghost Ballads, an album of folk songs with supernatural themes, was packaged with cover art by Addams showing a haunted house. The films The Old Dark House (1963) and Murder by Death (1976) feature title sequences illustrated by Addams. In 1946, Addams met science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury after having drawn an illustration for Mademoiselle magazine's publication of Bradbury's short story \\"Homecoming\\", the first in a series of tales chronicling a family of Illinois vampires named the Elliotts. The pair became friends and planned to collaborate on a book of the Elliott Family's complete history with Bradbury writing and Addams providing the illustrations, but it never materialized. Bradbury's stories about the \\"Elliott Family\\" were finally anthologized in From the Dust Returned in October 2001, with a connecting narrative and an explanation of his work with Addams, and Addams' 1946 Mademoiselle illustration used for the book's cover jacket. Although Addams' own characters were well-established by the time of their initial encounter, in a 2001 interview, Bradbury stated: \\"[Addams] went his way and created the Addams Family, and I went my own way and created my family in this book.\\" Janet Maslin, in a review of an Addams biography for The New York Times, wrote: \\"Addams's persona sounds cooked up for the benefit of feature writers... was at least partly a character contrived for the public eye,\\" noting that one outr√© publicity photo showed the humorist wearing a suit of armor at home, \\"but the shelves behind him hold books about painting and antiques, as well as a novel by John Updike.\\" Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock was a friend of Addams, and owned two pieces of original Addams art. Hitchcock references Addams in his 1959 film North by Northwest. During the auction scene, Cary Grant discovers two of his adversaries with someone whom he also thinks is against him and says: \\"The three of you together. Now that's a picture only Charles Addams could draw.\\" The University of Pennsylvania has a Charles Addams Fine Arts Hall on its campus at 36th and Walnut Streets in Philadelphia. There is a small sculpture of the Addams Family in front of the building. Bibliography By Addams Dear Dead Days, with the Addams Family on the cover.

Persian Bay√°n, Exordium.Browne, E.G. Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf, p. 15 who manifests his will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestations of God (Arabic: ). It has no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of whom are concentrated in Iran.Barret (2001), p. 246 It was founded by  ªAli Muhammad Shirazi who first assumed the title of B√°b ( \\"Gate\\") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imam. However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the B√°b progressively outlined his teachings.Lambden, Stephen. The Evolving Clains and Titles of Mirza  ªAli Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819-1850 CE) Founded in 1844, the B√°bi Faith flourished in Persia until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the Ottoman Empire, especially Cyprus, as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the B√°b√≠ movement signaled a break with Shia Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While B√°bism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the B√°b as a predecessor to their own. Bah√° º√≠ sources maintain that the remains of the Bab were clandestinely rescued by a handful of B√°bis and then hidden. Over time the remains were secretly transported according to the instructions of Bah√° ºu'll√°h and then  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° through Isfahan, Kirmanshah, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut, and then by sea to Acre on the plain below Mount Carmel in 1899. On 21 March 1909, the remains were interred in a special tomb, the Shrine of the B√°b, erected for this purpose by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, on Mount Carmel in present-day Haifa, Israel. Etymology B√°bism, a term originating from Orientalists rather than the followers of the religion, comes from the Perso-Arabic noun bab (Arabic: ), meaning gate. Additionally, Bay√°n√≠ comes from the triliteral root B-Y-N which forms a class of words relating to concepts of clarity, differentiation, and separation, including Bay√°n which can refer to explanation, commentary, or exposition as well as the branch of Arabic rhetoric dealing with metaphors and interpretation.Espito, John L. The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, p. 39. Beliefs and teachings The B√°b's teachings can be grouped into three broad stages which each have a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the Quran and other Islamic traditions. While this interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to the philosophical elucidation and finally to legislative pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the B√°b gives an explanation of the metaphysics of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles are explicitly united. An analysis of the B√°b's writings throughout the three stages shows that all of his teachings were animated by a common principle that had multiple dimensions and forms. Hidden Imam In Twelver Shi ªa Islamic belief there were twelve Imams, the last of which, known as Imam Mahdi, who communicated with his followers only through certain representatives. According to the Twelver's belief, after the last of these representatives died, the Imam Mahdi went into a state of Occultation; while still alive, he was no longer accessible to his believers. Shi ªa Muslims believe that when the world becomes oppressed, the Imam Mahdi (also termed the Qa'im) will come out of occultation and restore true religion on Earth before the cataclysmic end of the world and judgement day. In B√°b√≠ belief the B√°b is the return of the Imam Mahdi, but the doctrine of the Occultation is implicitly denied; instead the B√°b stated that his manifestation was a symbolic return of the Imam, and not the physical reappearance of the Imam Mahdi who had died a thousand years earlier. In B√°b√≠ belief the statements made from previous revelations regarding the Imam Mahdi were set forth in symbols. The B√°b also stated that he was not only the fulfillment of the Shi ªi expectations for the Q√°'im, but that he also was the beginning of a new prophetic dispensation. Resurrection, Judgment Day and cyclical revelation The B√°b taught that his revelation was beginning an apocalyptic process that was bringing the Islamic dispensation to its cyclical end, and starting a new dispensation. He taught that the terms \\"resurrection\\", \\"Judgement Day\\", \\"paradise\\" and \\"hell\\" used in Shi ªa prophecies for the end-times are symbolic. He stated that \\"Resurrection\\" means that the appearance of a new revelation, and that \\"raising of the dead\\" means the spiritual awakening of those who have stepped away from true religion. He further stated that \\"Judgement Day\\" refers to when a new Manifestation of God comes, and the acceptance or rejection of those on the Earth. Thus the B√°b taught that with his revelation the end times ended and the age of resurrection had started and that the end-times were symbolic as the end of the past prophetic cycle. In the Persian Bay√°n, the B√°b wrote that religious dispensations come in cycles, as the seasons, to renew \\"pure religion\\" for humanity. This notion of continuity anticipated future prophetic revelations after the B√°b. Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest While the B√°b claimed a station of revelation, he also claimed no finality for his revelation. One of the core B√°b√≠ teachings is the great Promised One, whom the B√°b termed He whom God shall make manifest, promised in the sacred writings of previous religions would soon establish the Kingdom of God on the Earth. In the books written by the B√°b he constantly entreats his believers to follow He whom God shall make manifest when he arrives and not behave like the Muslims who have not accepted his own revelation. Religious law The B√°b abrogated Islamic law and in the Persian Bay√°n promulgated a system of B√°b√≠ law, thus establishing a separate religion distinct from Islam. Some of the new laws included changing the direction of the Qibla to the B√°b's house in Shiraz, Iran and changing the calendar to a solar calendar of nineteen months and nineteen days (which became the basis of the Bah√° º√≠ calendar) and prescribing the last month as a month of fasting. The B√°b also created a large number of rituals and rites. Some of these rituals include the carrying of arms only in times of necessity, the obligatory sitting on chairs, the advocating of the cleanliness displayed by Christians, the non-cruel treatment of animals, the prohibition of beating children severely, the recommendation of the printing of books, even scripture and the prohibition on the study of logic or dead languages. Other laws include elaborate regulations regarding pilgrimage, fasting, the manufacture of rings, the use of perfume, and the washing and disposal of the dead. History Antecedents Twelver Shi ªi Muslims regard the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, as the last of the Imams. They contend that Muhammad al-Mahdi went into the Occultation in 874 CE, at which time communication between the Imam and the Muslim community could only be performed through mediators called BƒÅbs \\"gates\\" or NƒÅ'ibs \\"representatives\\". In 940, the fourth nƒÅ'ib claimed that Imam Muhammad al- Mahdi had gone into an indefinite \\"Grand Occultation\\", and that he would cease to communicate with the people. According to Twelver belief, the Hidden Imam is alive in the world, but in concealment from his enemies, and that he would only emerge shortly before the Last Judgment. At that time, acting as al-QƒÅ'im (\\"He who will arise\\"), a messianic figure also known as the Mahdi (\\"He who is rightly guided\\"), the Hidden Imam would start a holy war against evil, would defeat the unbelievers, and would start a reign of justice. In 1830s Qajar Persia, Sayyid Kazim Rashti was the leader of the Shaykhis, a sect of Twelvers. The Shaykhis were a group expecting the imminent appearance of al- QƒÅ æim. At the time of Kazim's death in 1843, he had counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Lord of the Age whose advent would soon break on the world. Origin The room in the B√°b's house in Shiraz where he declared his mission to Mulla Husayn. On 22 May, 1844 Mull√° Husayn of Boshruyeh in Khorasan, a prominent disciple of Sayyid KƒÅ·∫ìim, entered Shiraz following the instruction by his master to search for al-QƒÅ'im. Soon after he arrived in Shiraz, Mull√° Husayn came into contact with the B√°b. On the night of 22 May 1844, Mulla Husayn was invited by the B√°b to his home; on that night Mull√° Husayn told him that he was searching for the possible successor to Sayyid KƒÅ·∫ìim, al-QƒÅ'im, and the B√°b told Mull√° Husayn privately that he was Sayyid KƒÅ·∫ìim's successor and the bearer of divine knowledge. Through the night of the 22nd to dawn of the 23rd, Mulla Husayn became the first to accept the B√°b's claims as the gateway to Truth and the initiator of a new prophetic cycle; the B√°b had replied in a satisfactory way to all of Mull√° Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long commentary on the surah of Yusuf, which has come to be known as the Qayy≈´mu l-AsmƒÅ' and is often considered the B√°b's first revealed work, though he had before then composed a commentary on Surat al-Fatihah and Surat al- Baqara.Lawson, Todd. \\"The Authority of the Feminine and Fatima's Place in an Early Work by the Bab.\\" The Most Learned of the Shi ªa: The Institution of the Marja ºTaqlid (2007): 94-127. This night and the following day are observed in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith as a holy day since then. After Mulla Husayn accepted the B√°b's claim, the B√°b ordered him to wait until 17 others had independently recognized the station of the B√°b before they could begin teaching others about the new revelation. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Sayyid KƒÅ·∫ìim had independently recognized the B√°b as a Manifestation of God. Among them was one woman, Zarrin TƒÅj BaraghƒÅni, a poet, who later received the name of T√°hirih (the Pure). These 18 disciples were later to be known as the Letters of the Living and were given the task of spreading the new faith across Iran and Iraq. The B√°b emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who along with himself, made the first \\"Unity\\" of his religion. After his declaration, he soon assumed the title of the B√°b. Within a few years the movement spread all over Iran, causing controversy. His claim was at first understood by some of the public at the time to be merely a reference to the Gate of the Hidden Im√°m of Muhammad, but this understanding he publicly disclaimed. He later proclaimed himself, in the presence of the heir to the Throne of Persia and other notables, to be al-QƒÅ'im. In the B√°b's writings, the B√°b appears to identify himself as the gate (b√°b) to Muhammad al-Mahdi and later he begins to explicitly proclaim his station as equivalent to that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God. Saiedi states the exalted identity the B√°b was claiming was unmistakable, but due to the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam. To his circle of early believers, the B√°b was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them that he was not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and al-QƒÅ'im himself. During his early meetings with Mull√° Husayn, the B√°b described himself as the Master and the Promised One; he did not consider himself just Sayyid KƒÅ·∫ìim Rashti's successor, but claimed a prophetic status, with a sense of deputyship delegated to him not just from the Hidden Imam, but from Divine authority; His early texts, such as the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, used Qur ºanic language that implied divine authority and identified himself effectively with the Imam. When MullƒÅ  øAlƒ´ Bas·π≠ƒÅmƒ´, the second Letter of the Living, was put on trial in Baghdad for preaching about the B√°b, the clerics studied the Commentary on the Sura of Yusuf, recognized in it a claim to divine revelation, and quoted from it extensively to prove that the author had made a messianic claim. Spread The B√°b's message was disseminated by the Letters of the Living through Iran and southern Iraq. One of these initial activities was communicated to the West starting 8 January 1845 as an exchange of diplomatic reports concerning the fate of Mull√°  øAli-e BastƒÅmi, the second Letter. These were exchanges between Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet who wrote first to Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. Followups continued until in 1846 he was sentenced by the Ottomans to serve in the naval shipyards at hard labor‚Äîthe Ottoman ruler refusing to banish him as it would be \\"difficult to control his activities and prevent him spreading his false ideas.\\" Qudd√∫s and other early followers then were sent on to Shiraz to begin public presentations of the new religion. Indeed various activities the B√°b initiated were devolved to various Letters of the Living like preaching activities and answering questions from the community. In particular as these first public activities multiplied opposition by the Islamic clergy arose and prompted the Governor of Shiraz to order the B√°b's arrest. The B√°b, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. This series of events become the first public account of the new religion in the West when they were published 1 Nov 1845 in The Times. The story was also carried from 15 Nov by the Literary Gazette\\"Mahometan Schism\\", Literary Gazette, 15 Nov. 1845, p. 757, 1st column, below middle which was subsequently echoed widely.for example see: * \\"Mahomedan Schism\\", Vermont Watchman and State Journal, 19 Feb 1845, p. 4, second column, top * \\"Mahometan Schism\\", Signal of Liberty, p. 3, center top of full page view * \\"Mahometan Schism\\", The Eclectic Magazine of Foreign Literature, Science, and Art, Jan/Feb 1846, p. 142, bottom left then top of right columns * \\"A modern Mahomet\\", Boon's Lick Times, 4 Apr 1846, p. 1, fourth column, half way down * \\"Mahometan Schism\\", Morning Chronicle, 4 Apr 1846, p. 4, 5th column, top, as highlighted * \\"Mahometan Schism\\", South Australian, 7 April 1846 p. 3, bottom of second column, top of next, as highlighted * \\"Persia\\", South Australian Register, 11 Apr 1846, p. 3, 5th column near bottom, as highlighted * \\"Mahometan Schism\\", New Zealand Spectator Cook's Strait Guardian, 15 July 1846, p. 3, near bottom of text selection The B√°b was placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle, and was restricted in his personal activities, until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846. The B√°b was released and departed for Isfahan. There, many came to see him at the house of the im√°m jum'ih, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the B√°b debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared. After the death of the Governor of Isfahan, Manouchehr Khan Gorji, an Iranian Georgian,Cheyne, The Reconciliation of Races and Religions, 29. who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, Mohammad Shah Qajar, ordering the B√°b to Tehran in January, 1847. After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the B√°b could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the B√°b to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, and later Maku and Chehriq, where he was confined. During his confinement, he was said to have impressed his jailers with his patience and dignity. Communication between the B√°b and his followers was not completely severed but was quite difficult, and more responsibilities were devolved to the Letters as he was not able to elucidate his teachings to the public. With B√°b√≠ teachings now mostly spread by his followers, they faced increasing persecution themselves. The role played by T√°hirih in KarbalƒÅ æ was particularly significant. She began an effort of innovation in religion based on her station as a Letter of the Living and the incarnation of Fatimah. In his early teachings, the B√°b emphasized observing Sharia and extraordinary acts of piety. However, his claim of being the BƒÅb, i.e. the authority direct from God, was in conflict with this more conservative position of supporting Sharia. T√°hirih innovated an advance in the understanding of the priority of the B√°b's station above that of Islamic Sharia by wedding the concept of the BƒÅb's overriding religious authority with ideas originating in Shaykhism pointing to an age after outward conformity. She seems to have made this connection circa 1262/1846 even before the BƒÅb himself. The matter was taken up by the community at large at the Conference of Badasht. This conference was one of the most important events of the B√°b√≠ movement when in 1848 its split from Islam and Islamic law was made clear. Three key individuals who attended the conference were Bah√° ºu'll√°h, Qudd√∫s, and T√°hirih. T√°hirih, during the conference, was able to persuade many of the others about the B√°b√≠ split with Islam based on the station of the B√°b and an age after outward conformity. She appeared at least once during the conference in public without a veil, heresy within the Islamic world of that day, signalling the split. During this same month the B√°b was brought to trial in Tabriz and made his claim to be the Mahdi public to the Crown Prince and the Shi ªa clergy. Several sources agree that by 1848 or 1850 there were 100,000 converts to Babism. In the fall of 1850 newspaper coverage fell behind quickly unfolding events. Though the B√°b was namedSummary of General News, The Moreton Bay Courier, 4 January 1851, page 1s, 4th column, a bit down from the top for the first time he had in fact already been executed. Uprisings and massacres By 1848 the increased fervour of the B√°b√≠s and the clerical opposition had led to a number of confrontations between the B√°b√≠s and their government and clerical establishment. After the death of Mohammad Shah Qajar, the shah of Iran, a series of armed struggles and uprisings broke out in the country, including at Tabarsi. These confrontations all resulted in B√°b√≠ massacres; Bah√° º√≠ authors give an estimate of 20,000 B√°b√≠s killed from 1844 to present, with most of the deaths occurring during the first 20 years. Former Professor of Islamic Studies Denis MacEoin studied documented deaths, both for individuals and for round figures, from B√°b√≠, Bah√° º√≠, European, and Iranian sources, and confirmed at most two to three thousand. He stated that he could not find evidence for any higher figures. Supporters of the B√°b√≠s paint their struggle as basically defensive in nature; Shi ªi writers on the other hand point to this period as proof of the subversive nature of B√°b√≠sm. MacEoin has pointed out that the B√°b√≠s did arm themselves, upon the B√°b's instructions, and originally intended an uprising, but that their eventual clashes with state forces were defensive, and not considered an offensive jihad. In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, Amir Kabir, was convinced that the B√°b√≠ movement was a threat and ordered the execution of the B√°b which was followed by the killings of many B√°b√≠s. Shrine of Shaykh ·π¨abars√≠ =Fort Tabarsi= Of the conflicts between the B√°b√≠s and the establishment, the first and best known took place in MƒÅzandarƒÅn at the remote shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi, about 22 kilometres southeast of BƒÅrfarush (modern Babol). From October 1848 until May 1849, around 300 B√°b√≠s (later rising to 600), led by Qudd√∫s and Mull√° Husayn, defended themselves against the attacks of local villagers and members of the Shah's army under the command of Prince Mahdi Qoli Mirza. They were, after being weakened through attrition and starvation, subdued through false promises of safety, and put to death or sold into slavery. =Zanjan upheaval= The revolt at the fortress of  øAli Mardan Khan in Zanjan in northwest Iran was by far the most violent of all the conflicts. It was headed by MullƒÅ Muhammad  ªAli Zanjani, called Hujjat, and also lasted seven or eight months (May 1850 ‚Äì January 1851). The B√°b√≠ community in the city had swelled to around 3000 after the conversion of one of the town's religious leaders to the B√°b√≠ movement. The conflict was preceded by years of growing tension between the leading Islamic clergy and the new rising B√°b√≠ leadership. The city governor ordered that the city be divided into two sectors, with hostilities starting soon thereafter. The B√°b√≠s faced resistance against a large number of regular troops, and led to the death of several thousand B√°b√≠s. After Hujjat was killed, and the B√°b√≠ numbers being greatly reduced, the B√°b√≠s surrendered in January 1851 and were massacred by the army. =Nayriz upheaval= Meanwhile, a serious but less protracted struggle was waged against the government at Neyriz in Fars by Yahya Vahid Darabi of Nayriz. Vahid had converted around 1500 people in the community and had thus caused tensions with the authorities which led to an armed struggle in a nearby fort. The B√°b√≠s resisted attacks by the town's governor as well as further reinforcements. After being given a truce offer on 17 June 1850, Vahid told his followers to give up their positions, which led to Vahid and the B√°b√≠s being killed; the B√°b√≠ section of the town was also plundered, and the property of the remaining B√°b√≠s seized. Later, in March 1853 the governor of the city was killed by the B√°b√≠s. These further events led to a second armed conflict near the city where the B√°b√≠s once again resisted troop attacks until November 1853, when a massacre of B√°b√≠s happened, with their women being enslaved. After the execution of the B√°b The Shrine of the B√°b in Haifa The revolts in Zanjan and Nayriz were in progress when in 1850 the B√°b, with one of his disciples, was brought from his prison at Chehriq citadel, which was called jabal alshadid meaning mount extreme by B√°b, to Tabriz and publicly shot in front of the citadel. The body, after being exposed for some days, was recovered by the B√°b√≠s and conveyed to a shrine near Tehran, whence it was ultimately removed to Haifa, where it is now enshrined. Most western scholars who reviewed the Faith of the B√°b after 1860 saw it as a way of letting in Western and Christian ideals into \\"a closed and rigid Moslem system\\" and giving the B√°b himself sometimes less or more credit for being authentic in the process. However some went further. In 1866 British diplomat Robert Grant Watson (b. 8 February 1834, d. 28 October 1892) published a history of the first 58 years of the 19th century of PersiaA History of Persia from the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century to the Year 1858 by Robert Grant Watson, pages 347‚Äì352, 385‚Äì393, 407‚Äì410, London: Smith, Elder and Co., 1866A History of Persia from the Beginning of the Nineteenth Century to the Year 1858 by Robert Grant Watson, 1866. and would serve in several diplomatic capacitiessee: * Mar√≠a Luz Incident * The diplomatic service; an abstract and examination of evidence taken by the Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1870 (1871) Watson summarizes the impact of the B√°b in Persia: Latter commentators also noted these kinds of views: Ernest Renan,*The Origins of Christianity: The apostles, Volume 2 of The Origins of Christianity, by Ernest Renan, Publisher Carleton, 1866,* Under \\"Some New Books\\", \\"vi\\", The Sun, New York New York, 11 September 1898, p. 22, 5th column near bottom to 6th column top Stephen Greenleaf Bulfinch,Babism, Studies in the evidences of Christianity, 1869, pp. 129 ‚Äì 140 son of Charles Bulfinch, and others. For the next two years comparatively little was heard of the B√°b√≠s. The B√°b√≠s became polarized with one group speaking of violent retribution against Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, while the other, under the leadership of Baha ºu'll√°h, looked to rebuild relationships with the government and advance the Bab√≠ cause by persuasion and the example of virtuous living.The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and violence, by Moojan Momen, 2011The Attempted Assassination of Nasir al Din Shah in 1852: Millennialism and Violence, by Moojan Momen, 2011 The militant group of Babis was between thirty and seventy persons, only a small number of the total Babi population of perhaps 100,000. Their meetings appear to have come under the control of a \\"Husayn Jan\\", an emotive and magnetic figure who obtained a high degree of personal devotion to himself from the group. Meanwhile Tahirih and Baha'u'llah, visible leaders of the community previously, were removed from the scene ‚Äì Tahirih by arrest and in the case of Baha'u'llah an invitation to go on pilgrimage to Karbila. On 15 August 1852, three from this small splinter group, acting on their own initiative, attempted to assassinate Naser al-Din Shah Qajar as he was returning from the chase to his palace at NiavarƒÅn. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire B√°b√≠ community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand B√°b√≠s followed, starting on 31 August 1852 with some thirty B√°b√≠s, including T√°hirih. Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, then the Shah's physician, was an eye-witness to her execution. Bah√° ºu'll√°h surrendered himself and he along with a few others were imprisoned in the SiƒÅhchƒÅl \\"Black Pit\\", an underground dungeon in Tehran. Meanwhile echoes of the newspaper coverage of the violence continued into 1853.Persian Heretics and Executioners under \\"English Extracts\\", New Zealand Spectator and Cook's Strait Guardian, 26 March 1853, Page 3, (near the middle) Succession In most of his prominent writings, the B√°b alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\", and that he himself was \\"but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest.\\" Within 20 years of the B√°b's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Shortly before the B√°b's execution, a follower of the B√°b, Abd al-Karim, brought to the B√°b's attention the necessity to appoint a successor; thus the B√°b wrote a certain number of tablets which he gave to Abd al-Karim to deliver to Subh-i Azal and Bah√° ºu'll√°h. These tablets were later interpreted by both Azalis and Bah√° º√≠s as proof of the B√°b's delegation of leadership. Some sources state that the B√°b did this at the suggestion of Bah√° ºu'll√°h. In one of the tablets, which is commonly referred to as the Will and Testament of the B√°b, Subh-i Azal is viewed to have been appointed as leader of the B√°bis after the death of the movement's founder; the tablet, in verse 27, orders Subh-i Azal \\"...to obey Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest.\\" At the time of the apparent appointment Subh-i Azal was still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the B√°b√≠ movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bah√° ºu'll√°h. All of this lends credence to the Bah√° º√≠ claim that the B√°b appointed Subh-i Azal the head of the B√°b√≠ Faith so as to divert attention away from Bah√° ºu'll√°h, while allowing B√°b√≠s to visit Bah√° ºu'll√°h and consult with him freely, and allowing Bah√° ºu'll√°h to write B√°b√≠s easily and freely. Subh-i Azal's leadership was controversial. He generally absented himself from the B√°b√≠ community spending his time in Baghdad in hiding and disguise; and even went so far as to publicly disavow allegiance to the B√°b on several occasions. Subh-i Azal gradually alienated himself from a large proportion of the B√°b√≠s who started to give their alliance to other claimants. During the time that both Bah√° ºu'll√°h and Subh-i- Azal were in Baghdad, since Subh-i Azal remained in hiding, Bah√° ºu'll√°h performed much of the daily administration of the B√°b√≠ affairs. Bah√° ºu'll√°h claimed that in 1853, while a prisoner in Tehran, he was visited by a \\"Maid of Heaven\\", which symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Ten years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration to be He whom God shall make manifest to a small number of followers, and in 1866 he made the claim public. Bah√° ºu'll√°h's claims threatened Subh-i Azal's position as leader of the religion since it would mean little to be leader of the B√°b√≠s if \\"Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest\\" were to appear and start a new religion. Subh-i-Azal responded by making his own claims, but his attempt to preserve the traditional B√°b√≠sm was largely unpopular, and his followers became the minority. A Baha'i Community (1910) An Azali Community in Iran Eventually Bah√° ºu'll√°h was recognized by the vast majority of B√°b√≠s as \\"He whom God shall make manifest\\" and his followers began calling themselves Bah√° º√≠s. By 1908, there were probably from half a million to a million Bah√° º√≠s, and at most only a hundred followers of Subh-i Azal. Subh-i Azal died in Famagusta, Cyprus in 1912, and his followers are known as Azalis or Azali B√°bis. MacEoin notes that after the deaths of those Azali Babis who were active in the Persian Constitutional Revolution, the Azali form of Babism entered a stagnation from which it has not recovered as there is no acknowledged leader or central organization. Some few have coined the term Bay√°n√≠ faith though it died out in Cyprus.This has been the standard term which the modern followers of B√°bism have adopted in order to identify themselves, however it has not been popular within scholarship, modern and contemporary to the religion's founders, the majority of scholars ‚Äì such as Browne for instance ‚Äì choosing to refer to the religion as B√°bism or the B√°b√≠ Faith (Persian: , Bay√°n√≠). Current estimates of Azalis are that there are no more than a few thousand, living mainly in Iran. Writings :See also Writings of the B√°b The B√°b's major writings include the Qayy√∫mu'l-Asm√° º (a commentary on the Sura of Joseph), and the Persian Bay√°n, which the B√°b√≠s saw as superseding the Qur ºan. The latter has been translated into French; only portions exist in English. Unfortunately, most of the writings of the B√°b have been lost. The B√°b himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur ºan, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text. Nab√≠l-i-Zarand√≠, in The Dawn-Breakers, mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur ºan, revealed during the B√°b's imprisonment at M√°h-K√∫, which have been lost without a trace. Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the B√°b's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries. Most works were revealed in response to specific questions by B√°b√≠s. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as Paul of Tarsus. Three- quarters of the chapters of the New Testament are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them.On letters as a medium of the composition of the New Testament, see Norman Perrin, The New Testament: An Introduction, Proclamation and Parenesis, Myth and History (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, 1974), 96‚Äì97. Sometimes the B√°b revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and witnesses. The Archives Department at the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre currently holds about 190 Tablets of the B√°b. Excerpts from several principal works have been published in an English language compilation of the B√°b's writings: Selections from the Writings of the B√°b, other publications include Prayers from the Bab: The Remembrance of God. Denis MacEoin, in his Sources for Early BƒÅbƒ´ Doctrine and History, gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the B√°b revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur ºan, and many khutbihs or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations. Criticism Denis MacEoin, a former member of the Baha'i faith and now a critic, considers B√°b√≠ law as a \\"mishmash of rules and regulations that at times are little more than mere whimsy, revolving around some of the Bab's own obsessions about cleanliness, polite behaviour, and elegance. It is a shari'a, but not in any practical sense. Certainly, it does not seem to be going anywhere...Here and there we find indications that the Bab had been impressed by Europeans and that he wanted his followers to emulate them.\\" He further states: \\"One comes away from the Bayan with a strong sense that very little of this is to be taken seriously. It is a form of a game, never actually intended to be put into practice, much in the same way that whole sections of the Bab's later books don't, in fact, mean anything very much, but are elaborate exercises in interesting things you can do with Arabic roots. Or the way so many of the Bab's early writings, described as tafsirs on this or that sura of the Qur ºan, are really not commentaries at all.\\" He further criticizes the Babi laws stating \\"The average Babi could hardly hope to afford the three diamonds, four yellow rubies, six emeralds, and six red rubies that he was expected to give to the Babi Messiah, let alone find time to observe all the rules and regulations laid down in the book. For all that, the Babi shari'a made an impact.\\" Nader Saiedi states that the severe laws of the Bay√°n were never meant to be put in practice, because their implementation depended on the appearance of He whom God shall make manifest, while at the same time all of the laws would be abrogated unless the Promised One would reaffirm them. Saiedi concludes that these can then only have a strategic and symbolic meaning, and were meant to break through traditions and to focus the B√°b's followers on obedience to He whom God shall make manifest.

When Leo's rival, the Italian gangster Johnny Caspar, announces his intent to kill bookie Bernie Bernbaum, Leo goes against Tom's advice and extends his protection to Bernie, who is the brother of Verna, who has begun a relationship with Leo ‚Äì while also carrying on an affair with Tom. Tom tries everything he can to convince Leo to give Bernie up to Caspar to prevent a war; he attempts to convince Leo that Verna is playing him to protect her brother but Leo will not be swayed. After an assassination attempt on Leo, Tom reveals his affair with Verna to Leo to prove that she is dishonest. Leo beats Tom and turns his back on both of them. Tom then approaches Caspar looking for work and Caspar commands him to kill Bernie in the woods at Miller's Crossing to prove his loyalty. Bernie pleads with Tom to spare him, saying \\"Look in your heart\\". Tom fires his gun to fake the killing and tells Bernie to run and hide. Caspar assumes Leo's position as boss of the city, controlling the police and using them to destroy Leo's operations. Tom begins sowing discord between Caspar and his trusted enforcer, the brutal Eddie \\"the Dane\\" Dane. Upon finding that his men didn't actually see Tom kill Bernie, Dane takes Tom back to Miller's Crossing to see if Bernie's body is there. Tom nearly cracks as they approach the location but they find a body that had been shot in the face and disfigured by birds. Unknown to Tom, Bernie returned to town and killed Mink, who was the Dane's lover, and placed the body where his should have been. Bernie holds this over Tom's head and tries to blackmail Tom into killing Caspar. Tom uses Mink's unknown whereabouts to convince Caspar that Eddie Dane has betrayed him. Dane denies it and Caspar has to decide whom he believes, and whom he will kill. In a rage, he beats Eddie Dane before shooting him in the head. Tom then arranges a meeting with Bernie but sends Caspar instead on the pretext that he will be meeting Mink. Bernie arrives before Caspar and kills him. Tom arrives and tricks Bernie into giving up his gun, saying they can blame Eddie Dane, then reveals that Dane is dead and that he intends to kill Bernie in retribution for blackmailing him. Bernie again begs for mercy, saying \\"Look in your heart\\" but Tom asks \\"What heart?\\" and shoots him. With Caspar and Eddie Dane dead, Leo resumes his post as boss. Verna has won her way back into Leo's good graces and she reacts coldly to Tom. On the day Bernie is buried, Leo announces that Verna has proposed to him and offers Tom his job back but Tom turns him down and stays behind, watching as Leo departs.  Cast   Production  While writing the screenplay, the Coen brothers tentatively titled the film The Bighead‚Äîtheir nickname for Tom Reagan. The first image they conceived was that of a black hat coming to rest in a forest clearing; then, a gust of wind lifts it into the air, sending it flying down an avenue of trees. This image closes the film's opening credit sequence. Because of the intricate, dense plot, the Coens suffered from writer's block with the script. They stayed with a close friend of theirs at the time, William Preston Robertson in St. Paul, Minnesota, hoping that a change of scenery might help. After watching Baby Boom one night, they returned to New York City and wrote Barton Fink (in three weeks) before resuming the Miller's Crossing screenplay. The budget was reported by film industry magazines as around $14 million, but the Coens have said that the film cost \\"substantially less\\" than that. According to Paul Coughlin, \\"The casting of Byrne allows for the psychological assurance, self- confidence and icy demeanour to be physically reproduced in the sturdy and unruffled presence of the tall and lean actor. Tom is 'a man who walks behind a man, whispers in his ear', he is the brains behind Leo's operation, and he is the heartless centre of Miller's Crossing.\\" Although he was a native Irishman playing a lieutenant to an Irish mobster, the Coens did not originally want Gabriel Byrne to use his own accent in the film. Byrne argued that his dialogue was structured in such a way that it was a good fit for his accent and after he tried it, the Coens agreed; Byrne and Finney used Irish accents in the film.Jackson, Matthew. \\"13 Fascinating Facts About Miller's Crossing\\", Mental Floss, October 10, 2015 During casting they had envisioned Trey Wilson (who played Nathan Arizona in their previous film Raising Arizona) as gangster boss Leo O'Bannon but two days before principal photography began, Wilson died from a brain hemorrhage and Finney was cast. Roger Westcombe calls Finney's portrayal of Leo \\"perfectly nuanced in a brilliant performance\\". Finney also appears in drag in a cameo as an elderly female ladies' room attendant. The Coens cast family and friends in minor roles. Sam Raimi, director and friend of the Coens, appears as the snickering gunman at the siege of the Sons of Erin social club, while Frances McDormand, Joel Coen's wife, appears as the mayor's secretary. The role of The Swede was written for Peter Stormare but he could not be cast since he was playing Hamlet (a role often referred to as \\"the Dane\\"). J. E. Freeman was cast and the name of the character was changed to The Dane, while Stormare went on to be featured in Fargo and The Big Lebowski. The city in which the story takes place is unidentified but the film was shot in New Orleans as the Coen Brothers were attracted to its look. Ethan Coen commented in an interview, \\"There are whole neighborhoods here of nothing but 1929 architecture. New Orleans is sort of a depressed city; it hasn't been gentrified. There's a lot of architecture that hasn't been touched, store-front windows that haven't been replaced in the last sixty years.\\" Principal photography ran from January 27 to April 28, 1989.  Influences  Westcombe finds in the opening title sequence of a fedora being blown off its bed of fallen leaves in the forest, a subtle homage to Jean-Pierre Melville's 1963 French crime film Le Doulos, which ends with the gangster protagonist's fate underlined wistfully by the shot of his fedora coming to rest, alone in the frame, in the soil of the forest floor. Writing in The Atlantic, Christopher Orr sees in the opening scene, in which Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito) confronts Leo O'Bannon (Albert Finney) and Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) \\"an obvious nod to the opening of The Godfather\\".Orr, Christopher. \\"30 Years of Coens: Miller's Crossing\\", The Atlantic, September 10, 2014 Miller's Crossing quotes many gangster films and films noir. Many situations, characters and dialogue are derived from the work of Dashiell Hammett, particularly his 1931 novel The Glass Key. There are some parallels between the two stories and many scenes and lines are lifted from this novel. The relationship between Tom and Leo in the film mirrors the relationship between Ned Beaumont and Paul Madvig, the principal characters of the Hammett novel.Moraes, Francis. (March 17, 2010). Miller's Crossing. Another important Hammett source was his 1929 novel Red Harvest, which details the story of a gang war in a corrupt Prohibition-era American city, a war initiated by the machinations of the main character. While Miller's Crossing follows the plot and main characters of The Glass Key fairly closely, the film has no direct scenes, characters, or dialogue from Red Harvest. Orr also notes, \\"The ending of Miller‚Äôs Crossing makes even clearer reference to the immaculate final scene of The Third Man: a funeral, a protagonist abandoned by his car, who watches as the last person he cares for in the world walks away down a dirt road hemmed by trees\\".  Reception  Miller's Crossing opened in limited release in New York City on September 22, 1990, after premiering at the New York Film Festival the day before. It was a box-office failure at the time, making slightly more than $5 million, out of its $10‚Äì$14 million budget. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though possibly more notable for its distinctive style than an airtight story, this Coen brothers take on the classic gangster flick features sharp dialogue, impressive cinematography, and a typically quirky cast of characters.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Film critic David Thomson calls the film \\"a superb, languid fantasia on the theme of the gangster film that repays endless viewing\\".Thomson, David (2008), \\"Have You Seen...?\\", New York City: Knopf, p. 554. Of Turturro's performance he says \\"This could be the finest work of one of our best supporting actors\\". Roger Ebert gave it 3/4 stars, stating \\"It is likely to be most appreciated by movie lovers who will enjoy its resonance with films of the past\\". Miller's Crossing won the Critic's Award at the 2nd Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival in February 1991. It was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. Frank Moraes says, \\"Gabriel Byrne does an excellent job in this film, ... this film lives and dies on his performance\\". Taking particular note of the work of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and production designer Dennis Gassner, Christopher Orr observed, \\"Miller's Crossing is an aesthetic pleasure of the highest order on nearly every level\\".  Soundtrack  The score was written by Carter Burwell, his third collaboration with the Coen brothers. The main theme is based on the Irish folk ballad \\"Lament for Limerick\\". Burwell takes a traditional piece of music with some culturally relevant connection and uses it as the central motif of the broader arrangement. The main theme has been utilized in trailers for a number of other films, including The Shawshank Redemption, as well as in an ad for Caffrey's Irish Ale. The soundtrack includes jazz tunes, such as \\"King Porter Stomp\\", reflective of the era in which the film is set. Other songs include \\"Danny Boy\\", sung by Frank Patterson, an Irish tenor, which is heard in Leo's house. Patterson can also be heard singing Jimmy Campbell's \\"Goodnight Sweetheart\\" in a scene in the Shenandoah Club.

Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor. Her work is of interest to social historians as well as readers of literature. Her first novel, Mary Barton, was published in 1848. Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront√´, published in 1857, was the first biography of Charlotte Bront√´. In this biography, she wrote only of the moral, sophisticated things in Bront√´‚Äôs life; the rest she left out, deciding that certain, more salacious aspects were better kept hidden. Among Gaskell's best known novels are Cranford (1851‚Äì53), North and South (1854‚Äì55), and Wives and Daughters (1865), each having been adapted for television by the BBC. Early life Gaskell was born Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson on 29 September 1810 in Lindsey Row, Chelsea, London, at the house that is now 93 Cheyne Walk. She was the youngest of eight children; only she and her brother John survived infancy. Her father, William Stevenson, a Unitarian from Berwick-upon-Tweed, was minister at Failsworth, Lancashire, but resigned his orders on conscientious grounds; he moved to London in 1806 with the intention of going to India after he was appointed private secretary to the Earl of Lauderdale, who was to become Governor General of India. That position did not materialise, however, and instead, Stevenson was nominated Keeper of the Treasury Records. His wife, Elizabeth Holland, came from a family established in Lancashire and Cheshire that was connected with other prominent Unitarian families, including the Wedgwoods, the Martineaus, the Turners and the Darwins. When she died 13 months after giving birth to her youngest daughter, she left a bewildered husband who saw no alternative but to send Elizabeth to live with her mother's sister, Hannah Lumb, in Knutsford, Cheshire. Elizabeth's future while she was growing up was uncertain, as she had no personal wealth and no firm home, though she was a permanent guest at her aunt and grandparents' house. Her father remarried, to Catherine Thomson, in 1814. They had a son, William, in 1815, and a daughter, Catherine, in 1816. Although Elizabeth spent several years without seeing her father, to whom she was devoted, her older brother John often visited her in Knutsford. John was destined for the Royal Navy from an early age, like his grandfathers and uncles, but he did not obtain preferment into the Service and had to join the Merchant Navy with the East India Company's fleet. John went missing in 1827 during an expedition to India. Character and influences A beautiful young woman, Elizabeth was well-groomed, tidily dressed, kind, gentle, and considerate of others. Her temperament was calm and collected, joyous and innocent, she reveled in the simplicity of rural life. Much of Elizabeth's childhood was spent in Cheshire, where she lived with her aunt Hannah Lumb in Knutsford, the town she immortalized as Cranford. They lived in a large red-brick house called The Heath (now Heathwaite).Heathside (now Gaskell Avenue), which faces the large open area of Knutsford Heath. From 1821 to 1826 she attended a school run by the Misses Byerley at Barford House and afterward at Avonbank in Stratford-on-Avon, where she received the traditional education in arts, the classics, decorum and propriety given to young ladies from relatively wealthy families at the time. Her aunts gave her the classics to read, and she was encouraged by her father in her studies and writing. Her brother John sent her modern books, and descriptions of his life at sea and his experiences abroad. After leaving school at the age of 16, Elizabeth traveled to London to spend time with her Holland cousins. She also spent some time in Newcastle upon Tyne (with the Rev William Turner's family) and from there made the journey to Edinburgh. Her stepmother's brother was the miniature artist William John Thomson, who in 1832 painted a portrait of Elizabeth Gaskell in Manchester. A bust was sculpted by David Dunbar at the same time. Married life and writing career George Richmond On 30 August 1832 Elizabeth married a Unitarian minister, William Gaskell, in Knutsford. They spent their honeymoon in North Wales, staying with her uncle, Samuel Holland, near Porthmadog. The Gaskells then settled in Manchester, where William was the minister at Cross Street Unitarian Chapel. Manchester's industrial surroundings influenced Elizabeth's writing in the industrial genre. Their first child, a daughter, was stillborn in 1833. Their other children were Marianne (1834), Margaret Emily, known as Meta (1837), Florence Elizabeth (1842), and Julia Bradford (1846). Marianne and Meta boarded at the private school conducted by Rachel Martineau, sister of Harriet, a close friend of Elizabeth. Florence married Charles Crompton, a barrister and Liberal politician, in 1863. In March 1835 Gaskell began a diary documenting the development of her daughter Marianne: she explored parenthood, the values she placed on her role as a mother; her faith, and, later, relations between Marianne and her sister, Meta. In 1836 she co-authored with her husband a cycle of poems, Sketches among the Poor, which was published in Blackwood's Magazine in January 1837. In 1840 William Howitt published Visits to Remarkable Places containing a contribution entitled Clopton Hall by \\"A Lady\\", the first work was written and published solely by her. In April 1840 Howitt published The Rural Life of England, which included a second work titled Notes on Cheshire Customs. In July 1841 the Gaskells traveled to Belgium and Germany. German literature came to have a strong influence on her short stories, the first of which she published in 1847 as Libbie Marsh's Three Eras, in Howitt's Journal, under the pseudonym \\"Cotton Mather Mills\\". But other influences including Adam Smith's Social Politics enabled a much wider understanding of the cultural milieu in which her works were set. Her second story printed under the pseudonym was The Sexton's Hero. And she made her last use of it in 1848, with the publication of her story Christmas Storms and Sunshine. A son, William, (1844‚Äì45), died in infancy, and this tragedy was the catalyst for Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton. It was ready for publication in October 1848, shortly before they made the move south. It was an enormous success, selling thousands of copies. Ritchie called it a \\"great and remarkable sensation.\\" It was praised by Thomas Carlyle and Maria Edgeworth. She brought the teeming slums of manufacturing in Manchester alive to readers as yet unacquainted with crowded narrow alleyways. Her obvious depth of feeling was evident, while her turn of phrase and description was described as the greatest since Jane Austen.Ritchie, p. xviii. In 1850 the Gaskells moved to a villa at 84 Plymouth Grove.Uglow J. Elizabeth Gaskell: A Habit of Stories (Faber and Faber; 1993) () She took her cow with her. For exercise, she would happily walk three miles to help another person in distress. In Manchester, Elizabeth wrote her remaining literary works, while her husband held welfare committees and tutored the poor in his study. The Gaskells' social circle included writers, journalists, religious dissenters, and social reformers such as William and Mary Howitt and Harriet Martineau. Poets, patrons of literature and writers such as Lord Houghton, Charles Dickens and John Ruskin visited Plymouth Grove, as did the American writers Harriet Beecher Stowe and Charles Eliot Norton, while the conductor Charles Hall√©, who lived close by, taught piano to one of their daughters. Elizabeth's friend Charlotte Bront√´ stayed there three times, and on one occasion hid behind the drawing room curtains as she was too shy to meet the Gaskells' other visitors. Gaskell House, Plymouth Grove, Manchester In early 1850 Gaskell wrote to Charles Dickens asking for advice about assisting a girl named Pasley whom she had visited in prison. Pasley provided her with a model for the title character of Ruth in 1853. Lizzie Leigh was published in March and April 1850, in the first numbers of Dickens's journal Household Words, in which many of her works were to be published, including Cranford and North and South, her novella My Lady Ludlow, and short stories. In June 1855 Patrick Bront√´ asked Gaskell to write a biography of his daughter Charlotte, and The Life of Charlotte Bront√´ was published in 1857. This played a significant role in developing Gaskell's own literary career. In the biography, Gaskell chose to focus more on Bront√´ as a woman than as a writer of Romantic fiction.Stone, Donald D. The Romantic Impulse in Victorian Fiction. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1980, p. 141. In 1859 Gaskell traveled to Whitby to gather material for Sylvia's Lovers, which was published in 1863. Her novella Cousin Phyllis was serialized in The Cornhill Magazine from November 1863 to February 1864. The serialization of her last novel, Wives and Daughters, began in August 1864 in The Cornhill. She died of a heart attack in 1865, while visiting a house she had purchased in Holybourne, Hampshire. Wives and Daughters was published in book form in early 1866, first in the United States and then, ten days later, in Britain. Reputation and re-evaluation Gaskell's reputation from her death to the 1950s was epitomized by Lord David Cecil's assessment in Early Victorian Novelists (1934) that she was \\"all woman\\" and \\"makes a creditable effort to overcome her natural deficiencies but all in vain\\" (quoted in Stoneman, 1987, from Cecil, p. 235). A scathing unsigned review of North and South in The Leader accused Gaskell of making errors about Lancashire which a resident of Manchester would not make and said that a woman (or clergymen and women) could not \\"understand industrial problems\\", would \\"know too little about the cotton industry\\" and had no \\"right to add to the confusion by writing about it\\". Gaskell's novels, with the exception of Cranford, gradually slipped into obscurity during the late 19th century; before 1950, she was dismissed as a minor author with good judgement and \\"feminine\\" sensibilities. Archie Stanton Whitfield wrote that her work was \\"like a nosegay of violets, honeysuckle, lavender, mignonette and sweet briar\\" in 1929. Cecil (1934) said that she lacked the \\"masculinity\\" necessary to properly deal with social problems (Chapman, 1999, pp. 39‚Äì40). However, the critical tide began to turn in Gaskell's favour when, in the 1950s and 1960s, socialist critics like Kathleen Tillotson, Arnold Kettle and Raymond Williams re-evaluated the description of social and industrial problems in her novels (see Moore, 1999 for an elaboration), and‚Äîrealizing that her vision went against the prevailing views of the time‚Äîsaw it as preparing the way for vocal feminist movements.Stoneman, Patsy (1987). Elizabeth Gaskell. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. , p. 3. In the early 21st century, with Gaskell's work \\"enlisted in contemporary negotiations of nationhood as well as gender and class identities\\",, p. 9. North and South ‚Äì one of the first industrial novels describing the conflict between employers and workers ‚Äì was recognized as depicting complex social conflicts and offering more satisfactory solutions through Margaret Hale: spokesperson for the author and Gaskell's most mature creation.Pearl L. Brown. \\"From Elizabeth Gaskell's Mary Barton To Her North And South: Progress Or Decline For Women?\\" Victorian Literature and Culture, 28, pp. 345‚Äì358. In her introduction to The Cambridge Companion to Elizabeth Gaskell (2007), a collection of essays representing the current Gaskell scholarship, Jill L. Matus stresses the author's growing stature in Victorian literary studies and how her innovative, versatile storytelling addressed the rapid changes during her lifetime. Legacy The house on Plymouth Grove remained in the Gaskell family until 1913, after which it stood empty and fell into disrepair. The University of Manchester acquired it in 1969 and in 2004 it was acquired by the Manchester Historic Buildings Trust, which then raised money to restore it. Exterior renovations were completed in 2011 and the house is now open to the public. On 25 September 2010, a memorial to Elizabeth Gaskell was dedicated to Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. It takes the form of a panel in the Hubbard memorial window, above the tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer. The panel was dedicated by her great-great-great-granddaughter Sarah Prince and a wreath was laid. Manchester City Council have created an award in Gaskell's name, given to recognize women's involvement in charitable work and improvement of lives. A bibliometric Mrs. Gaskell and me: Two Women, Two Love Stories, Two centuries Apart, by Nell Stevens was published in 2018.\\"A Funny Heartfelt Tribute to a Literary Giant\\", Irish Times, 29 September 2018. Literary style and themes A scene from Cranford Gaskell's first novel, Mary Barton, was published anonymously in 1848. The best-known of her remaining novels are Cranford (1853), North and South (1854), and Wives and Daughters (1865). She became popular for her writing, especially her ghost stories, aided by Charles Dickens, who published her work in his magazine Household Words. Her ghost stories are in the \\"Gothic\\" vein, making them quite distinct from her \\"industrial\\" fiction. Even though her writing conforms to Victorian conventions, including the use of the name \\"Mrs. Gaskell\\", she usually framed her stories as critiques of contemporary attitudes. Her early works focused on factory work in the Midlands. She usually emphasized the role of women, with complex narratives and realistic female characters.Excluding reference to Gaskell's Ghost Stories, Abrams, M. H., et al. (eds), \\"Elizabeth Gaskell, 1810‚Äì1865\\". The Norton Anthology of English Literature, The Major Authors: The Romantic Period through the Twentieth Century, 7th ed., Vol. B. New York, London: W.W. Norton & Company, 2001. . DDC 820.8‚Äîdc21. LC PR1109.N6. Gaskell said she was influenced by the writings of Jane Austen. She then felt qualified to write a book on one of the greatest authors of all time, smoothing over patches in her life that were too rough for the sophisticated society woman. Her treatment of class continues to interest social historians as well as fiction lovers. Themes Unitarianism urges comprehension and tolerance toward all religions and even though Gaskell tried to keep her own beliefs hidden, she felt strongly about these values which permeated her works; in North and South, \\"Margaret the Churchwoman, her father the Dissenter, Higgins the Infidel, knelt down together. It did them no harm.\\" Dialect usage Gaskell's style is notable for putting local dialect words into the mouths of middle-class characters and the narrator. In North and South Margaret Hale suggests redding up (tidying) the Bouchers' house and even offers jokingly to teach her mother words such as knobstick (strike- breaker).Ingham, P. (1995). Introduction to the Penguin Classics edition of North and South. In 1854 she defended her use of dialect to express otherwise inexpressible concepts in a letter to Walter Savage Landor: She also used the dialect word \\"nesh\\" (soft), which goes back to Old English, in Mary Barton: and later in \\"The Manchester Marriage\\" [1858]: ::Now, I'm not above being neshed for other folks myself. I can stand a good blow, and never change colour; but, set me in the operating-room in the Infirmary, and I turn as sick as a girl. ::At Mrs Wilson's death Norah came back to them, as a nurse to the newly-born little Edwin; into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father; who declared that if he found out that Norah ever tried to screen the boy by falsehood, or to make him nesh either in body or mind, she should go that very day..

Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  Design  NeWS started by implementing a PostScript interpreter running in a cooperative multitasking fashion, since, unlike PostScript in a printer, NeWS would be displaying a number of PostScript programs at the same time on one screen. It also added a complete view hierarchy, based on viewports known as canvases, and a synchronous event distribution system, supporting events, interests, threads and monitors. Like the view system in most GUIs, NeWS included the concept of a tree of embedded views along which events were passed. For instance, a mouse click would generate an event that would be passed to the object directly under the mouse pointer, say a button. If this object did not respond to the event, the object \\"under\\" the button would then receive the message, and so on. NeWS included a complete model for these events, including timers and other automatic events, input queues for devices such as mice and keyboards, and other functionality required for full interaction. The input handling system was designed to provide strong event synchronization guarantees that were not possible with asynchronous protocols like X. To support user interface widgets, NeWS expanded the original PostScript stack-based language into a complete object oriented (OO) programming style with inheritance. This eliminated the need for an external OO language to build a complete application. Since all of these additions were implemented as extensions to PostScript, it was possible to write simple PostScript code that would result in a running, onscreen, interactive program. Two popular demonstration programs were an onscreen clock, which required about two pages of code, and a program which drew a pair of eyes that followed the cursor as it moved around the screen. The eyeball program was shown at SIGGRAPH in 1988 and was the inspiration for the later well-known X application xeyes. NeWS included several libraries of user interface elements (widgets), themselves written in NeWS. These widgets ran all of their behavior in the NeWS interpreter, and only required communications to an outside program (or more NeWS code) when the widget demanded it. For example, a toggle button's display routine can query the button's state (pressed or not) and change its display accordingly. The button's PostScript code can also react to mouse clicks by changing its state from \\"pressed\\" to \\"not pressed\\" and vice versa. All this can happen in the windowing server without interaction with the client program, and only when the mouse is released on the button will an event be sent off for handling. This was more sophisticated than the X Window System server model, which can only report \\"mouse button was clicked down here\\", \\"mouse is now here\\", \\"mouse button was released here\\" events to a client, which then has to figure out if the event is in the button, switch the state, and finally instruct the server to display the new state. If client and server are not on the same machine, these interactions must travel over the network, which results in a delay in responding. NeWS was architecturally similar to what is now called AJAX, except that NeWS coherently: * used PostScript code instead of JavaScript for programming. * used PostScript graphics instead of DHTML and CSS for rendering. * used PostScript data instead of XML and JSON for data representation. TNT-based applications The best example of such a library is TNT (The NeWS Toolkit) which Sun released in 1989. Sun also shipped an earlier \\"Lite\\" toolkit intended for example purposes and making small programs.  Licensing  Although adoption was never widespread, several companies licensed NeWS and adapted it for various uses. * SGI used a version of it named 4Sight to replace their proprietary MEX windowing system. * Grasshopper Group created a Macintosh port called MacNeWS. * Architech Corporation ported NeWS to OS/2James Gosling, David S. H. Rosenthal, Michelle J. Arden (1989). The NeWS Book. Springer Verlag. p. 193. . Google Book Search. Retrieved 2009-03-29.  Applications  The OPEN LOOK version of the FrameMaker desktop publishing program, developed by Frame Technology Corp. with funding mainly from Sun Microsystems and NSA, was one of the few commercial products that ran on NeWS. HyperLook, developed by Arthur van Hoff at The Turing Institute, was an interactive application design system.HyperLook (aka HyperNeWS (aka GoodNeWS)) Don Hopkins developed a NeWS version of SimCity that was built with HyperLook. A commercial drawing program, Altsys Virtuoso, was produced for NeWS; it was a port of FreeHand with additional functionality that took advantage of the PostScript environment. Unfortunately Sun announced the end of support for NeWS just as Virtuoso became ready to ship.  Competition with X Window System  Compared to X, NeWS was vastly more powerful, but also slower (especially for local connections). The C API was very low level and difficult to use, so most NeWS programs tended to be entirely written in PostScript. Another factor in the popularity was that Sun charged a fee to license the NeWS source code, while the MIT X11 code was free of cost. The first versions of NeWS emulated the X10 protocol by translating the calls into NeWS PostScript. Speed problems plus the existence of programs that relied on the exact pixel results of X10 calls, and the obsolescence of X10, forced Sun to release an X11/NeWS hybrid called Xnews which ran an X11 server in parallel with the PostScript interpreter. This seriously degraded the NeWS interpreter performance and was not considered a very good X11 server either. Sun also implemented the OPEN LOOK user interface specification in several toolkits: The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an OPEN LOOK toolkit written in PostScript that ran in the NeWS server. OLIT was built on the same Xt (X Intrinsics) base as Motif, and XView used the same APIs as Sun's earlier SunView window system. After it was clear that OPEN LOOK had lost out to Motif in popularity, and after Adobe acquired FrameMaker, Sun stopped supporting NeWS, and products on NeWS simply vanished.

It is built from the Arabic words Abd, al- and Nasser. The name means \\"servant of the Helper\\", An-Nasser being a Muslim theophoric name. The letter a of the al- is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by u. The short \\"u\\" is taken from the classical Arabic nominative case ending, whereby the first element of the name is \\"'Abdu\\". Because the letter n is a sun letter, the letter l of the al- can be assimilated to it. Thus although the name is written in Arabic with letters corresponding to Abd al-Nasser, the pronunciation can correspond to Abd an-Nasser.

He has been credited with helping to redefine R&B; and hip hop, earning nicknames such as \\"the King of R&B;\\", \\"the King of Pop-Soul\\", and the \\"Pied Piper of R&B;\\". Kelly is known for songs including \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", \\"Bump N' Grind\\", \\"Your Body's Callin'\\", \\"Gotham City\\", \\"Ignition (Remix)\\", \\"If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time\\", \\"The World's Greatest\\", \\"I'm a Flirt (Remix)\\", and the hip-hopera \\"Trapped in the Closet\\". In 1998, Kelly won three Grammy Awards for \\"I Believe I Can Fly.\\" Although Kelly is primarily a singer and songwriter, he has written, produced, and remixed songs, singles, and albums for many artists. In 1996, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for writing Michael Jackson's song \\"You Are Not Alone\\". Kelly has sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him the most successful R&B; male artist of the 1990s and one of the world's best-selling music artists. He is the 55th best-selling music artist in the United States, with over 32 million album sales. Kelly was named by Billboard as the Top R&B;/Hip Hop Artist between 1985-2010 and the most successful R&B; artist in history. Since the 1990s, Kelly has been the subject of numerous allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, often with underage girls, all charges he denies. In 2002, he was indicted on 13 counts of child pornography, but was acquitted of all charges in 2008. In January 2019, a widely viewed Lifetime docuseries titled Surviving R. Kelly detailed allegations of sexual abuse by multiple women, allegations Kelly denies. Facing pressure from the public using the Mute R. Kelly hashtag, RCA Records dropped Kelly. On February 22, 2019, Kelly was indicted on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. On July 11, 2019, Kelly was arrested on federal charges alleging sex crimes, human trafficking, child pornography, racketeering, and obstruction of justice.\\"R. Kelly arrested in Chicago after being indicted by federal grand jury on new sex crime charges\\", Chicago Tribune, July 11, 2019. Kelly faces a total of 18 federal counts, including child pornography, kidnapping and forced labor, as of July 12, 2019. As a result, he is currently incarcerated at Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. Early life Robert Sylvester Kelly was born at Chicago Lying-in Hospital in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago on January 8, 1967. He is the third of four children with an older sister and brother and a younger brother. His mother, Joanne Kelly, was a professional singer who raised her children in the Baptist church, where she sang lead in the choir. The identity of his father, who has always been absent in Kelly's life, is not publicly known. His family lived in the Ida B. Wells Homes public housing project in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. Kelly's high school music teacher Lena McLin described Kelly's childhood home: \\"It was bare. One table, two chairs. There was no father there, I knew that, and they had very little.\\" Kelly began singing in the church choir at age eight. Kelly grew up in a house full of women, who he said would act differently when his mother and grandparents were not home. From age eight to 14, Kelly was sexually abused by an older female family member. Explaining why he never told anyone, Kelly wrote in his 2012 autobiography Soulacoaster that he was \\"too afraid and too ashamed\\". Around age 10, Kelly was also sexually abused by an older male who was a friend of the family. At age 11, Kelly was shot in the shoulder while riding his bike; the bullet is reportedly still lodged in his shoulder. While Kelly himself stated that he was shot by boys who were attempting to steal his bike, a family friend stated that Kelly shot himself while attempting suicide. Kelly was eight when he had his first girlfriend, Lulu. They would hold hands and eat make-believe meals inside their playhouse built from cardboard, where they \\"vowed to be boyfriend and girlfriend forever.\\" Kelly wrote in his autobiography that their last play date turned tragic when, after fighting with some older children over a play area by a creek, Lulu was pushed into the water. A fast-moving current swept her away while she screamed \\"Rob\\", his childhood nickname. Shortly thereafter, her lifeless body was found downstream. Kelly calls Lulu his very first musical inspiration. Kelly entered Kenwood Academy in Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood in the fall of 1981, where he met music teacher Lena McLin, who encouraged Kelly to perform the Stevie Wonder classic \\"Ribbon in the Sky\\" in the high school talent show. A shy Kelly put on sunglasses, was escorted onto the stage, sang the song and won first prize. Dr. McLin had encouraged a young Kelly to leave the high school basketball team and concentrate on music. She said he was furious at first, but after his performance in the talent show, he changed his mind. McLin remains Kelly's voice coach and spiritual adviser. Kelly played basketball with the late Illinois state champion basketball player Ben Wilson and sang \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" at Wilson's funeral. An undiagnosed and untreated learning disability, believed to be dyslexia, left Kelly unable to read or write. He dropped out of high school and as a teenager, Kelly began street performing under the Chicago Transportation Authority \\"El\\" tracks and eventually formed a group with friends Marc McWilliams, Vincent Walker and Shawn Brooks. In 1989, they formed the group MGM (Musically Gifted Men). In 1990, MGM recorded and released one single \\"Why You Wanna Play Me\\"; after its release the group disbanded. In 1991, Kelly signed with Jive Records. Kelly was extremely close to his mother Joanne, who took him with her to church and a local club where she performed. She died from cancer in 1993. He would later name his eldest daughter after her. Career 1992‚Äì1996: Born Into the 90's, 12 Play and R. Kelly R. Kelly gained national recognition in 1989 when he, along with Marc McWilliams, Vincent Walker and Shawn Brooks, participated on the talent TV show Big Break, hosted by Natalie Cole. Kelly went on to win the $100,000 grand prize. Subsequently, Kelly's debut album Born into the 90's was released in early 1992 (credited as R. Kelly and Public Announcement). Released during the new jack swing period of the early 1990s, the album yielded the R&B; hits \\"She's Got That Vibe\\", \\"Honey Love\\", \\"Dedicated\\", and \\"Slow Dance (Hey Mr. DJ)\\", with Kelly singing lead vocals. During late 1992, Kelly and Public Announcement embarked on a tour entitled \\"60653\\" after the zip code of their Chicago neighborhood. This would be the only album co-credited with Public Announcement. Kelly separated from the group in January 1993. Kelly's first solo album, 12 Play, was released on November 9, 1993, and yielded the singer's first number-one hit, \\"Bump N' Grind\\", which spent a record-breaking 12 weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot R&B; Singles chart. Subsequent hit singles: \\"Your Body's Callin'\\" (U.S. Hot 100: #13, U.S. R&B;: #2) and \\"Sex Me\\" (U.S. Hot 100: #20, U.S. R&B;: #8). Both singles sold 500,000 copies in the United States and were certified Gold by the RIAA. In 1994, 12 Play was certified Gold by the RIAA, eventually going six times platinum. In 1995, Kelly garnered his first Grammy nominations; two for writing, producing and composing Michael Jackson's last number one hit \\"You Are Not Alone\\". On November 14, 1995, Kelly's success continued with the release of R. Kelly, his eponymous second studio album. Critics praised him for his departure from salacious bedroom songs to embracing vulnerability. New York Times contributor Stephen Holden described Kelly as \\"The reigning king of pop-soul sex talks a lot tougher than Barry White, the father of such fluffed-up pillow talk and along with Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, [both] major influences for Kelly.\\" Also in December 1995, Professor Michael Eric Dyson critiqued Kelly's self- titled album \\"R. Kelly\\" for VIBE. Dyson described Kelly's growth from the 12 Play album: \\"Kelly reshapes his personal turmoil to artistic benefit\\" and noted that Kelly is \\"reborn before our very own ears.\\" The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming Kelly's first number one album on the chart, and reached number one on the R&B; album charts; his second. The R. Kelly album spawned three platinum hit singles: \\"You Remind Me of Something\\" (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&B;: #1), \\"I Can't Sleep (Baby If I)\\" (U.S. Hot 100: #5, U.S. R&B;: #1), and \\"Down Low (Nobody Has To Know)\\" (U.S. Hot 100: #4, U.S. R&B;: #1); a duet with Ronald Isley. Kelly's self-titled album sold four million copies, receiving 4√ó platinum certification from the RIAA. Kelly promoted the album with a 50-city \\"Down Low Top Secret Tour\\" with LL Cool J, Xscape, and Solo. On November 26, 1996, Kelly released \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", an inspirational song originally released on the soundtrack for the film Space Jam. \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 1 on the UK charts for three weeks and won three Grammy Awards in 1998. 1997‚Äì2001: Basketball, R. and TP-2.COM In 1997, Kelly signed a contract to play professional basketball with the Atlantic City Seagulls of the USBL. Kelly wore the number 12 in honor of his album 12 Play. Kelly said \\"I love basketball enough to not totally let go of my music, but just put it to the side for a minute and fulfill some dreams of mine that I've had for a long time.\\" Kelly's USBL contract contained a clause that would allow him to fulfill a music obligation when necessary. \\"If Whitney Houston needs a song written\\", said Ken Gross, the Seagulls owner who signed Kelly, \\"he would be able to leave the team to do that and come back\\". \\"It wasn't a gimmick,\\" Gross continued, \\"he's a ballplayer. He can play.\\" Kelly is the first music artist to play professional basketball.Demasio, Nunyo. \\"A Shooting Star: R. Kelly Lights Up USBL's Seagulls.\\" Daily Newslocation=New York, May 30, 1997. www.nydailynews.com/archives. Retrieved October 29, 2013. In 1998, Kelly wrote and produced the debut album of another prot√©g√© Sparkle, which was released under his Rockland label and distributed through Interscope. In 2000, Sparkle went platinum due in part to the success of the first single,\\"Be Careful\\", a duet with R. Kelly. On November 17, 1998, Kelly released his fourth studio and first double album, R. Musically, the album spans different genres from pop (Celine Dion), street rap (Nas and Jay-Z) to Blues (\\"Suicide\\"). Dave Hoekstra of the Los Angeles Times described the album as \\"easily the most ambitious project of his career.\\" As the year 2000 commenced, Kelly racked up a slew of new awards reflecting his status as an established R&B; superstar. In January 2000, Kelly had won Favorite Male Soul/R&B; Artist at the American Music Awards and, in February, was nominated for several Grammy Awards, including Best Male R&B; Vocal Performance (\\"When a Woman's Fed Up\\"), Best R&B; Album (R.), and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group (\\"Satisfy You\\") with P. Diddy. On November 7, 2000, Kelly released his fifth studio album TP-2.com, a project harking back to his breakthrough album, 12 Play. Unlike Kelly's previous effort, R., all songs on TP-2.com was written, arranged, and produced entirely by Kelly. AllMusic's Jason Birchmeier gave TP-2.com 4 stars and described Kelly's style: \\"Kelly knows how to take proven formulas and funnel them through his own stylistic aesthetic, which usually means slowing down the tempo, laying on lush choruses of strings and background vocals, taming down the lyrics for radio, and catering his pitch primarily to wistful women. In 2001, Kelly won the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Music of Black Origin or MOBO Awards and Billboard magazine ranked TP-2.com number 94 on the magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade. 2002‚Äì2003: The Best of Both Worlds and Chocolate Factory \\"The World's Greatest\\", from the Ali soundtrack, was a hit, and Kelly performed at the closing ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. On January 24, 2002, at the press conference announcing The Best of Both Worlds completion, celebrities such as Johnnie Cochran, Russell Simmons, Luther Vandross, and Sean Combs lined up to praise the album, with Jay-Z stating that he hoped the collaboration represents \\"more unity for black people on a whole.\\" Black Electorate described the collaboration as \\"one of the greatest power moves in black music history.\\" MTV's Shaheem Reid wrote: \\"And if Jay and Kelly can put their egos to the side long enough to wrap up and promote their album, then their labels‚ÄîDef Jam and Jive, respectively‚Äîcan surely figure out a way to join forces and make cheddar together. As determined by a coin toss, the album will be distributed on Roc-A-Fella/Def Jam in the U.S. and Canada, while Jive will handle distribution internationally.\\" When the joint album leaked on February 22, 2002, it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, to push the album's release date up from March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z expressed his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: \\"It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, but on the other hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [want it to]. Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life. You take parts of your life and you put it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [is frustrating]. The release date for The Best of Both Worlds was eventually moved back to the planned date, March 26. The album sold 285,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. In May 2002, Kelly's initial sixth studio album, Loveland, leaked and was delayed to release in November. 2004‚Äì2005: Happy People/U Saved Me and TP.3 Reloaded The Unfinished Business tour was plagued by a rivalry between the two stars and Kelly reportedly showing up late or not at all to gigs. The singer, according to Jay-Z, often complained that the touring lights were not directed towards him and often left during the middle of sets. Another night during the concert, Kelly stayed on his tour bus for two hours before finally coming out to perform an uninspired set. Jay-Z eventually removed R. Kelly halfway through the tour, after a member of Jay-Z's entourage attacked R. Kelly with Mace or pepper spray. On April 25, 2006, it was confirmed that Jay-Z's younger cousin, Tyran (Ty-Ty) Smith confessed in a Manhattan Criminal Court to pepper-spraying R. Kelly and four of his bodyguards at Madison Square Garden in October 2004. Smith had been charged with assault, but was allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct for four days of community service. After the original incident, Jay-Z made Smith an executive of Def Jam Records. Kelly also launched a $75-million lawsuit against Jay-Z for removing him from the tour, which received a countersuit by Jay-Z which was thrown out by the judge.  2006‚Äì2008: Double Up, Studio work and \\"I Believe\\"  Kelly's other single from Double Up titled \\"Rise Up\\" was a tribute to the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting. The song was officially released as a digital download May 15, 2007. Proceeds were donated to the Hokie Spirit Memorial Fund, a fund that helped family members of the victims of the shootings. Kelly began his Double Up tour with Ne-Yo, Keyshia Cole and J. Holiday opening for him. After two shows, promoter Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo removed from the tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges that the reason for the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans, even though he performed at just two shows. Ne-Yo filed a lawsuit against Rowe Entertainment. Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly failed to appear at another preliminary court hearing on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah. The judge threatened to revoke Kelly's bond, but eventually decided against it. In 2008, Kelly released a rap track titled \\"I'm a Beast\\" in which he coarsely attacked his detractors, though Kelly himself never mentioned by name the subjects for the song. In 2008, Billboard reported that Kelly had plans to release his newest album titled 12 Play: Fourth Quarter in the summer of that year but the album was postponed. Billboard also named Kelly among the most successful artists ever for its 50th Anniversary List. In the spring, the first promotional single \\"Hair Braider\\", peaked at No. 56 on Billboard's R&B; chart. On July 28, the entire album leaked online. 2009: Untitled, Africa and Soulacoaster In January 2009, after separating in the fall of 2005, Kelly and his wife Andrea Kelly finalized their divorce. The couple were married for 11 years. On June 3, Kelly released his first ever mixtape, The Demo Tape (Gangsta Grillz) presented by DJ Skee and DJ Drama as a way to reintroduce himself to fans. While at the Velvet Room in Atlanta in February 2009, Kelly announced that he was out there working on a new album and that it would be called Untitled. The album was given a September 29 release date. Kelly performed for the first time in Africa headlining the Arise African Fashion Awards in Johannesburg, South Africa, on June 20, 2009. Kelly performed in Cape Town before heading to Nigeria as part of the annual ThisDay music and fashion festival in July. Kelly also performed in Kampala, Uganda, in January 2010. He was scheduled to perform in London as part of his first international tour in eight years, but he did not make his London concert. \\"I'm very excited about my first visit to Africa, I've dreamed about this for a long time and it's finally here,\\" Kelly said in a statement. \\"It will be one of the highlights of not only my career but my life. I can't wait to perform in front of my fans in Africa‚Äîwho have been some of the best in the world.\\" In December 2009, Kelly teamed up with biographer David Ritz and Tavis Smiley's SmileyBooks publications to write his memoirs entitled Soulacoaster. SmileyBooks publisher and founder Tavis Smiley stated that the memoir's main focus would not be about Kelly's trials and tribulations. Smiley was quoted saying \\"If anyone thinks this book is going to fixate on [R. Kelly's trials], they are going to be sadly mistaken. It is going to be a holistic look at his life thus far and the life and legacy that he's building.\\"R. Kelly To Address Controversy In New Book. Yahoo Music 2010: Epic and Love Letter Kelly performed the song \\"Sign of a Victory\\" at the 2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on June 11, 2010.

The group features 2Face from Nigeria, Ali Kiba from Tanzania, Congolese singer Fally Ipupa, 4X4 from Ghana, hip-hop artist Movaizhaleine from Gabon, Zambia's JK, Ugandan hip-hop star Navio and Kenya's Amani, the only female in the group.

USA Today Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"Kelly is a single- bound kind of leaper who dips into everything from soft porn to opera in his music. His supreme chutzpah, a quality he shares with Streisand, allows him to feel secure within pop's traditions while taking them wherever he pleases. He made Davis' musical program, which at times got lost amid the chatter of the A-list crowd, come alive.

In a statement the organizers said, \\"Kelly's unforeseen and unavoidable health issues will prevent him from making a scheduled appearance on the music festival.\\" Johnny Gourzong, Sumfest Productions executive director, also commented, saying, \\"We are truly going to miss his presence on the festival.\\" On July 20, 2011, in a press release, representatives for R.

And y'all know, I love music and I feel like I can do anything when it comes to music because I am music‚Äîjust like y'all.\\" 2016: 12 Nights of Christmas Originally slated to be released in late 2014, Kelly presented his first Christmas album, and fourteenth studio album, 12 Nights of Christmas, on October 21, 2016. Artistry Musical style and influences Kelly's music took root in R&B;, hip hop and soul. One of Kelly's earliest musical memories is listening to his mother, Joanne Kelly, sing. He and his mother used to play records by Donny Hathaway and Marvin Gaye who became inspirations for young Robert. In reference to Hathaway, Kelly declared: \\"A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice that I always wanted in mine. He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time.\\" Kelly was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R&B; Lothario image. \\"I had to make a 'baby-makin' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it,\\" Kelly said. While Kelly has created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, from the beginning of his career the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. \\"Sex Me\\", \\"Bump n' Grind\\", \\"Your Body's Callin'\\", and \\"Feelin' on Yo Booty\\" are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry. Vocal style and lyrical themes Kelly's voice easily shifts from booming baritone to seductive alto. Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly's lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and spirituality. Chicago Sun-Times reporters Jim DeRogatis and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: \\"...the image he liked to project was that of the \\"R&B; Thug\\"...bringing the streetwise persona of the gangsta rapper into the more polite world of R&B.;\\" Kelly has said that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself in being versatile. Larry Khan, senior vice president of Jive's urban marketing and promotion, has said that Kelly's musical compass is second to none. DeRogatis and Pallasch reported that at concerts where Kelly would go from singing \\"Like a Real Freak\\" to \\"I Wish\\": \\"Many fans found these abrupt shifts between the transcendent and the venal, the inspirational and the X-rated jarring.\\" Rockland Records In 1998 Kelly launched his own label, the Interscope Records-distributed Rockland Records. The label's roster included artists Sparkle, Boo & Gotti, Talent, Vegas Cats, Lady, Frankie, Secret Weapon, and Rebecca F. Also in 1998, the label's first artist, Sparkle released her debut self-titled album, Sparkle. In addition to producing and writing the project, Kelly made vocal contribution to the hit duet \\"Be Careful,\\" which contributed largely to the album's success. The album was certified platinum in December 2000. In 1999, Kelly wrote and produced the soundtrack to the Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy movie Life, which features tracks from K-Ci & JoJo, Maxwell, M√Ωa, and Destiny's Child. The soundtrack was released on the Rockland label. The label is currently inactive but Kelly still owns the Rockland Records imprint. Controversies Illegal marriage According to Vibe and the Chicago Sun-Times, 27-year-old Kelly and 15-year-old prot√©g√©e Aaliyah were illegally married in a secret ceremony on August 31, 1994, in Cook County. Published in print as \\"R. Kelly's underage girlfriends.\\" Upon meeting Kelly and prior to the nuptials, Aaliyah admitted she had falsely stated she was 18. In a 2008 interview, Kelly's tour manager, Demetrius Smith, said that he facilitated the wedding by obtaining falsified identification for Aaliyah which listed her as 18 years of age. Kelly had been introduced to Aaliyah by her uncle, Barry Hankerson, just three years prior when she was 12 years old. In 2019, a contemporaneous video surfaced showing R. Kelly stating that Aaliyah was aged 14 years less than a year before the marriage took place. The marriage was annulled in February 1995 at the behest of Aaliyah's family by a Michigan judge. Kelly and Aaliyah, however, both denied that the marriage occurred and even denied that their relationship had ever moved beyond friendship. Despite denials of marriage, in May 1997 Aaliyah filed a lawsuit in Cook County to have her existing marriage records expunged, claiming that she was underage at the time of marriage and lied by signing the marriage certificate as an 18-year-old, and that she could not legally enter into marriage without parental consent. The expungement request was in the middle of a lawsuit filed by Tiffany Hawkins, who was seeking to use the marriage documents in her case against Kelly. Hawkins later accepted a settlement of $250,000 from Kelly, subject to a confidentiality agreement, in 1998. In 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Kelly with bribery related to the 1994 purchase of a fake ID for Aaliyah in order to obtain a marriage license. Allegations of child pornography and abuse booking photo In 1998, Kelly paid Tiffany Hawkins $250,000 after she claimed Kelly had induced her to have group sex with other teenage girls when she was 15 years old. On February 3, 2002, a video surfaced allegedly showing Kelly engaging in sex with, and urinating on, an underage girl. The story, which was released by an unknown source, was sent to the Chicago Sun-Times, the newspaper that broke the story on February 8, 2002. This news surfaced as Kelly was to perform at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Kelly said in interviews that he was not the man in the video. In June 2002, Kelly was indicted in Chicago on 21 counts of child pornography. That same month, Kelly was arrested by the Miami Police Department on a Chicago arrest warrant at his Florida vacation home, Kelly was later released after spending one night in jail on a bail bond posted of $750,000. The alleged victim refused to testify at the trial, and a Chicago jury found Kelly not guilty of 14 out of 14 counts of child pornography in June 2008. While investigating the photographs reported in the Chicago Sun-Times, Polk County Sheriff's Office conducted a search of Kelly's residence in Davenport, Florida. During the search, officers recovered 12 images of an alleged underage girl on a digital camera ‚Äì wrapped in a towel in a duffel bag ‚Äì which allegedly depicted Kelly \\"involved in sexual conduct with the female minor.\\" According to the Chicago Sun-Times, the girl in the images obtained from Kelly's Florida home also appears in the videotape which got Kelly indicted in Chicago. Kelly was arrested in January 2003 on those charges. In March 2004, these charges were dropped due to a lack of probable cause for the search warrants. Alleged sex cult Jim DeRogatis reported for BuzzFeed News on July 17, 2017, that Kelly was accused by three sets of parents of holding their daughters in an \\"abusive cult\\". Kelly and the alleged victims deny the allegations. In March 2018, BBC World Service aired a documentary entitled R Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotape presented by reporter Ben Zand that explored the 2017 allegations. This was followed up in May with the BBC Three documentary R Kelly: The Sex Scandal Continues which included interviews with the parents of the Savage daughters. Kelly was again accused of misconduct on April 17, 2018, by a former partner of his who claimed that Kelly \\"intentionally\\" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. A representative for Kelly stated that he \\"categorically denies all claims and allegations\\". In a January 2019 BBC News article, a woman named Asante McGee whom Kelly had met in 2014 and taken to live with him some months later, said that she lived with not only Kelly alone, but with other women. She said: \\"He controlled every aspect of my life, while I lived with him.\\" McGee later moved out on her own accord. Allegations of preteen child molestation In a divorce court filing unsealed in 2020, R. Kelly's former wife claims that R. Kelly was accused of molesting a preteen girl in 2009. Boycott and industry response In May 2018, the Women of Color branch of the Time's Up movement called for a boycott of Kelly's music and performances over the many allegations against him. The boycott was accompanied by a social media campaign called Mute R. Kelly. In response, his management said that Kelly supports the movement in principle, but targeting him was \\"the attempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture\\". The music streaming service Spotify announced on May 10 that it was going to stop promoting or recommending music by both R. Kelly and XXXTentacion. Spotify stated, \\"We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions‚Äîwhat we choose to program‚Äîto reflect our values.\\" Two days later, Apple Music and Pandora also announced that they will no longer be featuring or promoting R. Kelly's music. Spotify received criticism from members of the music industry who expressed worries of a \\"slippery slope\\" of muting artists, since R. Kelly had not ever actually been convicted of any crime. Spotify ultimately reversed this decision. Allegations of music industry complicity The Washington Post ran a lengthy article in May 2018 alleging that music industry executives had been aware of Kelly's sexually abusive behavior toward young women for years but did little or nothing about them due to his success as a performer and songwriter. As early as 1994, the newspaper reported, his tour manager had urged Jive Records' founder Clive Calder to tell Kelly he would not release the singer's records if he continued to have \\"incidents\\" with women after every concert he gave. Calder told the Post that he regretted not having done more at the time, saying \\"Clearly, we missed something.\\" Former Jive president Barry Weiss told the newspaper that during 20 years with the label he never concerned himself with Kelly's private life and was unaware of two lawsuits filed against Kelly and the label by women alleging sexual misconduct, suits in which the label had successfully argued it was not liable. Larry Khan, another Jive executive who worked closely with the singer even after viewing the sex tape, likewise implied it was not the label's responsibility, and pointed to Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis as musicians whose labels continued to release and promote their records despite public awareness that they were involved with young women. Executives at Epic Records also took a similarly relaxed attitude towards allegations of Kelly's sexual misconduct, the Post claimed. In 2002, after he signed with the label, executive David McPherson allegedly avoided viewing a copy of a tape purportedly showing the singer having sex with an underage girl, even as he had warned Kelly's assistant that if it turned out to be Kelly on that tape, the label would drop him. McPherson did not respond to the Posts requests for comment. An intern with the label whose work suffered after she began a relationship with Kelly, ultimately costing her the position, settled with Epic for $250,000; Cathy Carroll, the executive she worked for, regularly rebuked her former subordinate for having an affair with a married man whenever the two met at social functions for years afterwards, and the damage to the woman's reputation led her to abandon her career in the music industry. Carroll told the newspaper the woman was \\"starstruck ... A lot of times it's not really the men.\\" The Washington Post also suggested the labels were complicit in the sex-cult allegations from the previous summer's BuzzFeed piece. Employees at the studios where Kelly recorded were required to sign non-disclosure agreements and not enter certain rooms, which they said they believed were where Kelly made the women stay while he worked. Despite the agreements, the newspaper was able to publish screenshots of text exchanges where women in the rooms asked Kelly's assistants to let them out so they could go to the bathroom or get food. The newspaper also published pictures taken after Kelly had concluded a six-week session at a Los Angeles studio, paid for by his then-current label, RCA Records, showing a cup of urine sitting on a piano and urine stains on the wooden floor of another room. Musical response to allegations Kelly released the 19-minute long \\"I Admit\\" on SoundCloud on July 23, 2018, as a response to his accusers. The song does not contain any criminal admissions despite its title and chorus, which repeats the lyric \\"I admit it, I did it\\". In \\"I Admit\\", Kelly denies allegations of domestic violence and pedophilia, asserting that they are matters of opinion. Kelly also denounces Jim DeRogatis and repudiates his investigative report's claim of Kelly operating a \\"sex cult\\". Addressing the Mute R. Kelly social media campaign, Kelly sings, \\"only God can mute me\\". The song was criticized by reviewers, who described it as an act of trolling. Andrea Kelly and Carey Killa Kelly, R. Kelly's ex-wife and brother, responded to \\"I Admit\\" with a remix and a diss track. Surviving R. Kelly In January 2019, Lifetime began airing a six-part documentary series detailing sexual abuse and misconduct allegations against Kelly. Within two weeks, Kelly launched a Facebook page where he sought to discredit the accusers who appeared in the docuseries. Facebook removed the page for violating their standards as it appeared to contain personal contact information for his accusers. The second season titled Surviving R. Kelly Part II: The Reckoning premiered on January 2, 2020. Alleged sexual abuse of minors On February 22, 2019, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office in Illinois charged Kelly with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. The charges allege that from 1998 to 2010, Kelly sexually abused four females, three of whom were teen minors at the time, with evidence including a video provided by Michael Avenatti that allegedly depicts a new crime. Kelly turned himself in on the day the charges were announced and was arrested by the Chicago Police Department and taken into custody.. The judge set a $1 million bond, and ordered Kelly to have no contact with any minor under 18 or alleged victim. Kelly pleaded not guilty to all charges, which he called lies. He was released on bail after two nights in jail at Cook County. On March 6, 2019, Gayle King interviewed Kelly on CBS This Morning, where Kelly insisted on his innocence and blamed social media for the allegations. During the interview, Kelly had an emotional outburst where he stood up, pounded his chest, and yelled. Additionally, two women who reside with Kelly, whose parents say are brainwashed captives, declared love for Kelly and defended him during the broadcast. On July 11, 2019, Kelly was arrested on federal charges alleging sex crimes and obstruction of justice by U.S. Homeland Security investigators and NYPD detectives in Chicago.\\"R. Kelly arrested in Chicago after being indicted by federal grand jury on new sex crime charges\\", Chicago Tribune, July 11, 2019. On July 12, 2019, federal prosecutors from New York and Chicago indicted Kelly on 18 charges, including child sexual exploitation, child pornography production, kidnapping, forced labor, racketeering, and obstruction of justice. He was first denied bail in October 2019 and denied bail release again in April 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is currently incarcerated at Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. On August 5, 2019, a Minnesota prosecutor charged Kelly with soliciting a minor and prostitution following a 2001 allegation of inviting a girl up to his hotel room and paying her $200 to remove her clothing and dance with him. Kelly's attorney, Steve Greenberg, stated: \\"That case is a pure publicity grab by the prosecutor.\\" Greenberg also tweeted: \\"Re: New charges @RKelly give me a break. This is beyond absurd\\". Hennepin County State's Attorney Mike Freeman said: \\"...Minnesota victims deserve their day in court and that's why we're here. In my view, too many prosecutors are ignoring victims. This one doesn't.\\" Other legal issues After a July 1996 brawl at a Lafayette, Louisiana health club involving Kelly and his entourage, Kelly was placed on a year's unsupervised probation starting August 13, 1997, after being found guilty of battery. One of the victims needed 110 facial stitches. Also that year, a 20-year-old accused Kelly in civil court of having sexual relations with her when he was 24 and she was 15. Kelly settled the lawsuit in 1998 for $250,000, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. On April 8, 1998, Kelly was arrested on three misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct, including one charge on violating noise ordinance for playing his music extremely loud from his car. Prosecutors from the district attorney's office dropped the first two charges on May 7 and the noise charge on July 22 that year. On March 6, 2019, Kelly was taken back to the Cook County Jail after failing to pay $161,633 in child support. On March 9, 2019, he was released after someone, who did not want to be identified, paid off the child support. His lawyer says he could not discuss the payment due to a gag order. Influence R. Kelly performs in the \\"Mr. Show Biz Presents: The Light it Up Tour\\" of 2006 Kelly is considered to be one of the most successful R&B; artists since the mid-1980s. He is also one of the best-selling music artists in the United States with over 30 million albums sold as well as only the fifth black artist to enter the top 50 of the same list. Rolling Stone magazine called him \\"arguably the most important R&B; figure of the 1990s and 2000s.\\" Music executive Barry Weiss described Kelly as \\"the modern-day Prince, although there's a bit of Marvin Gaye in him, and a bit of Irving Berlin.\\" In addition to his solo and collaboration success, Kelly has also written and produced several hit songs, such as \\"Fortunate\\" for Maxwell, \\"You Are Not Alone\\" for Michael Jackson, \\"G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T.\\" for Changing Faces, \\"Bump, Bump, Bump\\" for B2K, and many more. R. Kelly has been compared to artists like Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye. Personal life Marriage In 1996, Kelly married Andrea Kelly, his former backup dancer and mother of his three children. In 1997, he built a house in Olympia Fields and moved in. Andrea filed a restraining order against Kelly in September 2005 after a physical altercation, ultimately filing for divorce in 2006. In January 2009, it was reported that Kelly's divorce was finalized. Philanthropy Kelly has contributed to various U.S. and international charities through donations and the proceeds of special performances. In 1995, Kelly donated ¬£20,000 to a U.K.charity, accepted by representative and former footballer Garth Crooks. In 2003, Kelly donated $50,000 to the Texas Military Family Foundation after the fund raising gig he staged for them. Kelly has also been in charity events in efforts to bring awareness for the fight against breast cancer. In 2003, Kelly released the single \\"Soldier's Heart\\" and donated all the proceeds of the song to the families of American soldiers. In 2007, Kelly released the song \\"Rise Up\\" for Virginia Tech after the 2007 school shooting, and donated the net proceeds to the families of the victims. In 2010, R. Kelly performed at a benefit concert for the Special Olympics of Angola and donated several specially-designed wheelchairs and the same year he also penned the song \\"Sign of a Victory\\" for the FIFA World Cup and all proceeds benefited African charities.

Kelly performed at a charity event in Chicago benefiting Clara's House, a now-shuttered (Jan 2018) facility designed to build employment, housing, health care, and education in the projects of Chicago. In 2016, Kelly donated cases of water to the Flint water crisis. Honors and awards Kelly has been awarded and nominated for multiple awards during his career, as a songwriter, producer, and singer.

Kelly"},{"id":"55525","text":"The liturgical year, also known as the church year or Christian year, as well as the kalendar, consists of the cycle of liturgical seasons in Christian churches that determines when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed, and which portions of Scripture are to be read either in an annual cycle or in a cycle of several years. Distinct liturgical colours may appear in connection with different seasons of the liturgical year. The dates of the festivals vary somewhat between the different churches, though the sequence and logic is largely the same. Liturgical cycle The liturgical year of some western churches, indicating the liturgical colours. The liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their own mood, theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colours of paraments and vestments for clergy, scriptural readings, themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home. In churches that follow the liturgical year, the scripture passages for each Sunday (and even each day of the year in some traditions) are specified in a lectionary. After the Protestant Reformation, Anglicans and Lutherans continued to follow the lectionary of the Roman Rite. Following a decision of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church revised that lectionary in 1969, adopting a three-year cycle of readings for Sundays and a two-year cycle for weekdays. Adaptations of the revised Roman Rite lectionary were adopted by Protestants, leading to the publication in 1994 of the Revised Common Lectionary for Sundays and major feasts, which is now used by many Protestant denominations, including also Methodists, Reformed, United, etc. This has led to a greater awareness of the traditional Christian year among Protestants, especially among mainline denominations. Biblical calendars Scholars are not in agreement about whether the calendars used by the Jews before the Babylonian exile were solar (based on the return of the same relative position between the sun and the earth), lunisolar (based on months that corresponded to the cycle of the moon, with periodic additional months to bring the calendar back into agreement with the solar cycle) like the present-day Jewish calendar of Hillel II, or purely lunar, as the Hijri calendar. The first month of the Hebrew year was called ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë (Aviv), evidently adopted by Moses from Ipip as the eleventh month of the non-lunar Egyptian calendar (that is also the origin of Abib as the tenth month of the non-lunar Ethiopian calendar),\\"This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you\\" (). \\"This day came ye out in the month Aviv\\" () meaning the month of green ears of grain. Having to occur at the appropriate time in the spring, it thus was originally part of a tropical calendar. At about the time of the Babylonian exile, when using the Babylonian civil calendar, the Jews adopted as the name for the month the term ◊†◊ô◊°◊ü (Nisan),\\"In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar\\" (), based on the Babylonian name Nisanu. Thomas J Talley says that the adoption of the Babylonian term occurred even before the exile. In the earlier calendar, most of the months were simply called by a number (such as \\"the fifth month\\"). The Babylonian-derived names of the month that are used by Jews are: # Nisan (March‚ÄìApril) # Iyar (April‚ÄìMay) # Sivan (May‚ÄìJune) # Tammuz (June‚ÄìJuly) # Av (July‚ÄìAugust) # Elul (August‚ÄìSeptember) # Tishrei (September‚ÄìOctober) # Marcheshvan (October‚ÄìNovember) # Kislev (November‚ÄìDecember) # Tevet (December‚ÄìJanuary) # Shevat (January‚ÄìFebruary) # Adar 1 (February; only during leap years) # Adar (February‚ÄìMarch) In Biblical times, the following Jewish religious feasts were celebrated: * Pesach (Passover) ‚Äì 14 Nisan (sacrifice of a lamb), 15 Nisan (Passover seder) * Chag HaMatzot (Unleavened Bread) ‚Äì 15-21 Nisan * Reishit Katzir (Firstfruits) ‚Äì 16 Nisan * Shavuot (Weeks) ‚Äì Fiftieth day counted from Passover, normally 6 Sivan * Rosh Hashanah (Trumpets) ‚Äì 1 Tishrei * Yom Kippur (Atonement) ‚Äì 10 Tishrei * Sukkot (Ingathering) ‚Äì 15-21 Tishrei * Shemini Atzeret (Assembly) ‚Äì 22 Tishrei * Chanukah (Dedication) ‚Äì 25 Kislev-2/3 Tevet (instituted in 164 BC) * Purim (Lots) ‚Äì 14-15 Adar (instituted in c. 400 BC) Eastern Christianity East Syriac Rite East Syriac Catholic churches. The Liturgical Calendar of the Catholic churches of East Syriac Rite (i.e. the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church) is fixed according to the flow of salvation history. With a focus upon the historical life of Jesus Christ, believers are led to the eschatological fulfilment (i.e. the heavenly bliss) through this special arrangement of liturgical seasons.Pathikulangara, Varghese. Mar Toma Margam, (A New Catechism for the St. Thomas Christians of India), Kottayam: Denha Services, 2004 The liturgical year is divided into 8 seasons of approximately 7 weeks each but adjusted to fit the solar calendar. The arrangement of the Seasons in the Liturgical Year is based on seven central events on celebrations of the Salvation History. They are: # Nativity of Christ # Epiphany of Christ # Resurrection of Christ # Pentecost # Transfiguration # Glorious Cross # Parousia (the Dedication of Church after Christ's second coming) The biblical reading and prayers during Mass and Liturgy of the Hours vary according to different seasons in the liturgical calendar. =Liturgical Calendar= The various seasons of the liturgical calendar of Syro Malabar Church and Chaldean Catholic Church are given below. Annunciation (Subara) Weeks of Annunciation (Subara) is the first season of the liturgical year. The liturgical year begins with the proclamation and celebration of the historical encounter between God and man in the person of Jesus Christ, the human appearance of the Divine Person. The Syriac word Subara, 'Annunciation', with which the Church qualify the first five or six weeks of her liturgical year, is, in fact, an announcement and proclamation with celebration with this supreme glad news of divine condescension to the human frailty in order to raise it up to the divine sublimity. The season begins on the Sunday just before the first of December and ends with the feast of Epiphany that is the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. This season is developed in the context of the mystery of incarnation completed in the fullness of time. The Church recalls during these days the announcement of the birth of John the Baptist, the predecessor of Jesus, and also the joyful event of the birth of John the Baptist. As a preparation for the celebration of the mystery of incarnation, this season also recalls creation, the disobedience of our first parents and its consequences, the miserable state of the broken humanity, the promise of salvation offered by God, God's covenant with humanity, and the prophecies about the Saviour. During this season the church also meditates on the role of Mary in the history of the plan of salvation. The whole importance of Mary, and hence her veneration in the Church, depends on her relation to Jesus, the most special being His mother. Her celebration is also underlined with two very solemn festivals of her: Immaculate Conception on December 8 and Congratulations to Mary as Mother of Jesus on the last Friday of this season. The Church practices abstinence during December 1‚Äì25 in preparation for Christmas; this period is called \\"25 days Lent\\". Feasts celebrated during this season * Feast of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, mother of Jesus (December 8) * Feast of Miraculous Cross of Mylapore (Saint Thomas Christian cross) (December 18) in Syro Malabar Church *Nativity of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ or Christmas (December 25) * Feast of Holy Infants (December 28) * Feast of Name Iso (January 1) * Feast of Mary, mother of Jesus (last Friday of Season) Epiphany (Denha) Weeks of Epiphany begins on the Sunday closest to the feast of Epiphany and runs to the beginning of Great Fast. The word Denha in Syriac means sunrise. During the period the faithful meditate on the manifestation of Holy Trinity and revelation of Christ the light of the world. Baptism in Jordan was the first historical event when the Holy Trinity is revealed to humans in the humanity of Jesus Christ. During the season the church celebrates the feasts of Saints in connection with the manifestation of the Lord. Feasts celebrated during the period *Feast of Epiphany or Feast of Baptism of the Lord (January 6) *Feast of Saint John the Baptist on first Friday of Epiphany *Feast of Apostles Peter (Kepha) and Paul on second Friday of Epiphany *Feast of Evangelists on third Friday of Epiphany *Feast of Saint Stephan on fourth Friday of Epiphany *Feast of Fathers of Church on fifth Friday of Epiphany *Feast of Patron Saint of Church on sixth Friday of Epiphany *Feast of all departed faithful on last Friday of Epiphany Great Fast (Sawma Rabba) During these weeks the faithful reflect on and meditate over the public life of Jesus and especially on its culmination in his passion, death and burial. The season begins 50 days before Easter on Peturta Sunday and comprises the whole period of Great Lent and culminates on Resurrection Sunday. Word Peturta in Syriac means \\"looking back\\" or \\"reconciliation\\". It is a God-given time for turning to one's own life more deeply and to become convinced of the abundant blessings of the loving God ‚Äì the creation, the providential caring, the human fall, the helplessness of man to save himself, the promise of salvation, the redemption through His Son Jesus and the Passion of the Christ. Faithful enter the weeks of Great Fast, celebrating the memory of all the Faithful Departed on the last Friday of Denha. According to the ecclesial and liturgical vision of this tradition, the weeks of Great Fast is also an occasion to keep up the memory of the beloved Departed through special prayers, renunciation, almsgiving, and so on and thus prepare oneself for a good death and resurrection in Jesus Christ. During the fast faithful of Syro Malabar Church do not use meat, fish, egg, many dairy products, and most favorite food items, and also avoid sexual contacts on all days including Sundays and Feast days. Before European colonization, Indian Nasranis used to take food only once a day (after 3:00 pm) on all days during Great Fast. Feasts in the Lenten Season *Peturta Sunday on First Sunday of Great Fast *Ash Monday or Clean Monday on the first day (Monday) of Great Fast *Lazarus Friday on the sixth Friday of Great Fast *Oshana Sunday on the seventh Sunday of Great Fast *Thursday of Pesha *Friday of Passion or Good Friday *Great Saturday or Saturday of Light The following feasts are always in the Lenten Season: *Feast of Mar Cyril of Jerusalem (March 18) *Feast of Saint Joseph (March 19) *Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) Resurrection (Qyamta) The weeks of Great Resurrection begin on the Resurrection Sunday and run to the feast of Pentecost. The Church celebrates the Resurrection of our Lord during these seven weeks: Jesus‚Äô victory over death, sin, suffering and Satan. It is the Season to exult in the new life obtained through the Resurrection of the Saviour. The church also commemorates various events that occurred after the resurrection of Christ, such as the visits of Jesus to Apostles and the ascension of Jesus. According to eastern Christianity, the Feast of Resurrection is the most important and the greatest feast in a liturgical year. Therefore, the season commemorating the resurrection of Christ is also of prime importance in the church liturgy. The first week of the season is celebrated as the 'Week of weeks' as it is the week of the resurrection of Christ. Feasts celebrated during the period: * Feast of Resurrection of Christ *Feast of All Confessors (Saints) on the first Friday of Qyamta *New Sunday or St. Thomas Sunday on the second Sunday of Qyamta * Feast of Ascension of Jesus on the sixth Friday of Qyamta The following feasts are always in the season of resurrection: *Feast of Saint George (April 24) *Feast of Mark the Evangelist (April 25) *Feast of Saint Joseph, the worker(May 1) *Feasts of Saint Philip and Saint James the apostles (May 3) Apostles (Slihe) Weeks of apostles (Slihe) starts on the feast of Pentecost, fiftieth day of the Resurrection Sunday. During these days the church commemorates the inauguration of church and the acts of apostles and church fathers through which the foundation of the church was laid. Church meditates on the virtues of the early church: fellowship, breaking of bread and sharing of wealth, and the fruits and gifts of Holy Spirit. The spread of the church all over the world as well as her growth is also remembered during this season. Feast celebrated during the season: *Feast of Pentecost on first Sunday of Slihe * Feast of Friday of Gold: The first commemoration of the first miracle of apostles done by Saint Peter. The following feasts are commemorated in the season of Slihe *Feast of Mar Aphrem (June 10) *Feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul (June 29) *Feast of Mar Thoma, founding father of east Syriac churches (July 3) *Feast of Mar Quriaqos and Yolitha (July 15) Qaita (Summer) Along the weeks of Qaita maturity and fruitfulness of church are commemorated. The Syriac word Qaita means ‚Äúsummer‚Äù. Summer is the time when grains and fruits mature and ripen. Thus it is a time of plentiful harvest for the Church. The fruits of the Church are those of holiness and martyrdom. While the sprouting and infancy of the Church were celebrated in 'the Weeks of the Apostles,' her development in different parts of the world by reflecting the image of the heavenly Kingdom and giving birth to many saints and martyrs are proclaimed during this season. Fridays of this Season are set apart for honoring Saints and Martyrs. Feast celebrated during the season: *Feast of twelve of apostles and Nusardeil on the first Sunday of Qaita. (Nusardeil is a Persian word which means ‚ÄúGod-given New Year Day‚Äù.) *Feast of Mar Jacob of Nisibis on the first Friday of Qaita. *Feast of Mar Mari on the second Friday of Qaita. *Feast of Marta Simoni and her Seven Children on the fifth Friday of Qaita. *Feast of Mar Shimun Bar Sabbai and Companions on the sixth Friday of Qaita. *Feast of martyr Mar Quardag on the seventh Friday of Qaita. The following feasts are commemorated in the season of Qaita *Feast of seventy disciples of Jesus (July 27) *Feast of Saint Alphonsa in Syro Malabar Catholic Church (July 28) *Feast of Transfiguration of Jesus (August 6) *Feast of Assumption of Mary (August 15) Eliyah- Sliba-Moses The name of the seasons of Eliyah-Sliba-Moses takes their origin from the feast of the transfiguration of Jesus. And the seasons revolve around the exaltation of the cross on the feast of the glorious cross on September 14. During the seasons of Eliyah and Sliba church reminds the faithful of the heavenly bliss which is promised to be inherited at the end of earthly life and the church commemorates the exaltic experience of the bliss through various holy sacraments. While during the season of Moses church meditates upon the end of time and the last judgment. Many at times the season of Moses is regarded as a distinct and separate season from the other two since it has a distinct theme. Season of Eliyah has a length of one to three Sundays. Season of Sliba starts on Sunday on or after the feast of the glorious cross and has a length of three to four weeks. The first Sunday of Sliba is always considered as the fourth Sunday of the combined season. The season of Moses always has four weeks. Feast celebrated during the seasons: *Feast of the glorious Cross The following feasts are commemorated in the seasons of Eliyah-Sliba-Moses * Feast of Nativity of Mary on September 8 and the eight day fast in preparation to the feast Eastern Orthodox Church The liturgical year in the Eastern Orthodox Church is characterized by alternating fasts and feasts, and is in many ways similar to the Roman Catholic year. However, Church New Year (Indiction) traditionally begins on September 1 (Old Style or New Style), rather than the first Sunday of Advent. It includes both feasts on the Fixed Cycle and the Paschal Cycle (or Moveable Cycle). The most important feast day by far is the Feast of Pascha (Easter) ‚Äì the Feast of Feasts. Then the Twelve Great Feasts, which commemorate various significant events in the lives of Jesus Christ and of the Theotokos (Virgin Mary). The majority of Orthodox Christians (Russians, in particular) follow the Julian Calendar in calculating their ecclesiastical feasts, but many (including the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Church of Greece), while preserving the Julian calculation for feasts on the Paschal Cycle, have adopted the Revised Julian Calendar (at present coinciding with the Gregorian Calendar) to calculate those feasts which are fixed according to the calendar date. Between 1900 and 2100, there is a thirteen-day difference between the dates of the Julian and the Revised Julian and Gregorian calendars. Thus, for example, where Christmas is celebrated on December 25 O.S. (Old Style), the celebration coincides with January 7 in the Revised Calendar. The computation of the day of Pascha (Easter) is, however, always computed according to a lunar calendar based on the Julian Calendar, even by those churches which observe the Revised Calendar. There are four fasting seasons during the year: The most important fast is Great Lent which is an intense time of fasting, almsgiving and prayer, extending for forty days prior to Palm Sunday and Holy Week, as a preparation for Pascha. The Nativity Fast (Winter Lent) is a time of preparation for the Feast of the Nativity of Christ (Christmas), but whereas Advent in the West lasts only four weeks, Nativity Fast lasts a full forty days. The Apostles' Fast is variable in length, lasting anywhere from eight days to six weeks, in preparation for the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29). The Dormition Fast lasts for two weeks from August 1 to August 14 in preparation for the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (August 15). The liturgical year is so constructed that during each of these fasting seasons, one of the Great Feasts occurs, so that fasting may be tempered with joy. In addition to these fasting seasons, Orthodox Christians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays throughout the year (and some Orthodox monasteries also observe Monday as a fast day). Certain fixed days are always fast days, even if they fall on a Saturday or Sunday (in which case the fast is lessened somewhat, but not abrogated altogether); these are: The Decollation of St. John the Baptist, the Exaltation of the Cross and the day before the Epiphany (January 5). There are several fast-free periods, when it is forbidden to fast, even on Wednesday and Friday. These are: the week following Pascha, the week following Pentecost, the period from the Nativity of Christ until January the 5th and the first week of the Triodion (the week following the 17th Sunday before Pentecost). =Pascha= The greatest feast is Pascha. Easter for both East and West is calculated as the first Sunday after the full moon that falls on or after March 21 (nominally the day of the vernal equinox), but the Orthodox calculations are based on the Julian calendar, whose March 21 corresponds at present with April 3 of the Gregorian calendar, and on calculations of the date of full moon different from those used in the West (see computus for further details). The date of Pascha is central to the entire ecclesiastical year, determining not only the date for the beginning of Great Lent and Pentecost, but affecting the cycle of moveable feasts, of scriptural readings and the Octoechos (texts chanted according to the eight ecclesiastical modes) throughout the year. There are also a number of lesser feasts throughout the year that are based upon the date of Pascha. The moveable cycle begins on the Zacchaeus Sunday (the first Sunday in preparation for Great Lent or the 33rd Sunday after Pentecost as it is known), though the cycle of the Octoechos continues until Palm Sunday. The date of Pascha affects the following liturgical seasons: *The period of the Triodion (the Sundays before Great Lent, Cheesefare Week, Palm Sunday, and Holy Week) *The period of the Pentecostarion (Sunday of Pascha through the Sunday After Pentecost which is also called the Sunday of all saints) =The twelve Great Feasts= Some of these feasts follow the Fixed Cycle, and some follow the Moveable (Paschal) Cycle. Most of those on the Fixed Cycle have a period of preparation called a Forefeast, and a period of celebration afterward, similar to the Western Octave, called an Afterfeast. Great Feasts on the Paschal Cycle do not have Forefeasts. The lengths of Forefeasts and Afterfeasts vary, according to the feast. * Nativity of the Theotokos (September 8)  birth of the Theotokos to Joachim and Anna * Elevation of the Cross (September 14)  the rediscovery of the original Cross on which Christ was crucified * Entrance of the Theotokos into the Temple (November 21)  the entry of the Theotokos into the Temple around the age of 3 * Nativity of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (December 25)  the birth of Jesus, or Christmas * Theophany (January 6)  the baptism of Jesus Christ, Christ's blessing of the water, and the revealing of Christ as God * Presentation of Our Lord in the Temple (February 2)  Christ's presentation as an infant in the Temple by the Theotokos and Joseph. * Annunciation of the Theotokos (March 25)  Gabriel's announcement to the Theotokos that she will conceive the Christ, and her wilful agreement thereto > Note: In Eastern practice, should this feast fall during Holy Week or on > Pascha itself, the feast of the Annunciation is not transferred to another > day. In fact, the conjunction of the feasts of the Annunciation and Pascha > (known as Œ¥ŒπœÄŒªŒÆ Œ†Œ±œÉœáŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨, dipli Paschalia in Modern Greek) is considered an > extremely festive event. * Entry into Jerusalem (Sunday before Pascha)  known in the West as Palm Sunday. * Ascension (40 days after Pascha)  Christ's ascension into Heaven following his resurrection. * Pentecost (50 days after Pascha)  The Holy Spirit comes and indwells the apostles and other Christian believers. * Transfiguration of Our Lord (August 6)  Christ's Transfiguration as witnessed by Peter, James and John. * Dormition of the Theotokos (August 15)  The falling asleep of the Theotokos (cf. the Assumption of Mary in Western Christianity) =Other feasts= Some additional feasts are observed with as though they were Great Feasts: * The Protection of the Mother of God (October 1), especially among the Russian Orthodox * The Feast of Saint James the Just (October 23) * The Feast of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki (October 26) * The Feast of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel (November 8) * The Feast of Saint Nicholas, the Bishop of Myra in Lycia (December 6) * The Feast of the Conception of Mary by Saints Joachim and Anne (December 9) * The Feast of Saint Spiridon (December 12) * The Feast of Saint Stephen the Deacon (December 27) * The Feast of Saint Basil the Great and the Circumcision of Christ (January 1) * The Feast of the Three Holy Hierarchs: Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom (January 30) * The Feast of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (March 9) * The Feast of Saint Patrick (March 17)St. Patrick's Day * The Feast of Saint George (April 23) * The Feast of the Holy Emperors Constantine and Helen (May 21) * The Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (June 24) * The Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (June 29) * The Feast of Saint Elijah the Prophet (July 20) * The Feast of Saint Christina of Bolsena the Great Martyr (July 24) * The Beheading of St. John the Baptist (August 29) * Beginning of the Indiction-Ecclesiastical Year (September 1) * The Patronal Feast of a church or monastery Every day throughout the year commemorates some saint or some event in the lives of Christ or the Theotokos. When a feast on the moveable cycle occurs, the feast on the fixed cycle that was set for that calendar day is transferred, with the propers of the feast often being chanted at Compline on the nearest convenient day. =Cycles= In addition to the Fixed and Moveable Cycles, there are a number of other liturgical cycles in the ecclesiastical year that affect the celebration of the divine services. These include, the Daily Cycle, the Weekly Cycle, the Cycle of Matins Gospels, and the Octoechos.  Oriental Orthodox and P'ent'ay Evangelical Churches  Western Christianity The month of October from a liturgical calendar for Abbotsbury Abbey. 13th-century manuscript (British Library, Cotton MS Cleopatra B IX, folio 59r). Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, including Lutheran, Anglican, and other Protestant calendars since this cycle pre-dates the Reformation. Generally, the liturgical seasons in western Christianity are Advent, Christmas, Ordinary Time (Time after Epiphany), Lent, Easter, and Ordinary Time (Time after Pentecost). Some Protestant traditions do not include Ordinary Time: every day falls into a denominated season. Vanderbilt University Professor Hoyt L. Hickman, with regard to the calendars of the Western Christians Churches that use the Revised Common Lectionary, including Presbyterians, Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Lutherans and some Baptists, among others, states that: Protestant Churches, with exception of the Lutheran and Anglican, generally observe fewer feasts with regard to the saints, than the aforementioned liturgical denominations, in addition to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. Denominational specifics =Roman Catholic Church= The Roman Catholic Church sets aside certain days and seasons of each year to recall and celebrate various events in the life of Christ. In its Roman Rite the liturgical year begins with Advent, the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus' birth, and his expected second coming at the end of time. This season lasts until Christmas Eve on December 24.Barry, One Faith, One Lord (2001), p. 116 Christmastide follows, beginning with First Vespers of Christmas on the evening of December 24 and ending with the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. Traditionally, the end of Christmastide was February 2, or the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, also known as Candlemas. This feast recounts the 40 days of rest Mary took before being purified and presenting her first-born son to the Temple in Jerusalem. Lent is the period of purification and penance that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday. The Holy Thursday evening Mass of the Lord's Supper marks the beginning of the Easter Triduum, which includes Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday. The days of the Easter Triduum recall Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples, death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. The seven-week liturgical season of Easter immediately follows the Triduum, climaxing at Pentecost. This last feast recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus' disciples after the Ascension of Jesus. The rest of the liturgical year is commonly known as Ordinary Time. There are many forms of liturgy in the Catholic Church. Even putting aside the many Eastern rites in use, the Latin liturgical rites alone include the Ambrosian Rite, the Mozarabic Rite, and the Cistercian Rite, as well as other forms that have been largely abandoned in favour of adopting the Roman Rite. Of this rite, what is now the \\"ordinary\\" or, to use a word employed in the Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum, the \\"normal\\" form is that given to it after the Second Vatican Council by Pope Paul VI and Pope John Paul II, while the 1962 Roman Missal form remains authorized, as an \\"extraordinary\\" form, for priests of the Latin Church without restriction in private celebrations, and under the conditions indicated in article 5 of the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum in public celebrations. The liturgical calendar in that form of the Roman Rite (see General Roman Calendar of 1960) differs in some respects from that of the present ordinary form, as will be noted below, and also from the earlier General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, the still earlier General Roman Calendar of 1954 and the original Tridentine Calendar. These articles can be consulted with regard to the Roman-Rite liturgical year before 1960. =Lutheran Churches= Lutheran church year =Anglican Church= The Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, uses a liturgical year that is in most respects identical to that of the 1969 Roman Catholic Common Lectionary. While the calendars contained within the Book of Common Prayer and the Alternative Service Book (1980) have no \\"Ordinary Time\\", Common Worship (2000) adopted the ecumenical 1983 Revised Common Lectionary. The few exceptions are Sundays following Christmas and Transfiguration, observed on the last Sunday before Lent instead of on Reminiscere. In some Anglican traditions (including the Church of England) the Christmas season is followed by an Epiphany season, which begins on the Eve of the Epiphany (on 6 January or the nearest Sunday) and ends on the Feast of the Presentation (on February 2 or the nearest Sunday). Ordinary Time then begins after this period. The Book of Common Prayer contains within it the traditional Western Eucharistic lectionary which traces its roots to the Comes of St. Jerome in the 5th century. Its similarity to the ancient lectionary is particularly obvious during Trinity season (Sundays after the Sunday after Pentecost), reflecting that understanding of sanctification.Sparrow, Anthony and John Henry Cardinal Newman. A Rationale upon the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, Oxford, UK =Reformed Churches= Reformed Christians emphasize weekly celebration of the Lord's day and, while some of them celebrate also what they call the five evangelical feasts, others celebrate no holy days. Liturgical calendar =Advent= Roman Rite liturgical year Advent (from the Latin word adventus, which means \\"arrival\\" or \\"coming\\") is the first season of the liturgical year. It begins four Sundays before Christmas, the Sunday falling on or nearest to November 30, and ends on Christmas Eve. Traditionally observed as a \\"fast\\", it focuses on preparation for the coming of Christ, not only the coming of the Christ-child at Christmas, but also, in the first weeks, on the eschatological final coming of Christ, making Advent \\"a period for devout and joyful expectation\\". This season is often marked by the Advent Wreath, a garland of evergreens with four candles. Although the main symbolism of the advent wreath is simply marking the progression of time, many churches attach themes to each candle, most often 'hope', 'faith', 'joy', and 'love'. Other popular devotions during Advent include the use of the Advent Calendar or the Tree of Jesse to count down the days to Christmas. Liturgical colour: violet or purple;General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 346 blue in some traditions, such as Methodist, Episcopalian, and Lutheran. =Christmastide= A white coloured parament hangs from the pulpit, indicating that the current liturgical season is Christmastide. The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the Advent wreath is lit also indicates that Christmas has arrived. The Christmas season immediately follows Advent. The traditional Twelve Days of Christmas begin with Christmas Eve on the evening of December 24 and continue until the feast of Epiphany. The actual Christmas season continues until the Feast of the Baptism of Christ, which in the present form of the Roman Rite is celebrated on the Sunday after January 6, or the following Monday if that Sunday is Epiphany. In the pre-1970 form, this feast is celebrated on January 13, unless January 13 is a Sunday, in which case the feast of the Holy Family is celebrated instead. Until the suppression of the Octave of the Epiphany in the 1960 reforms, January 13 was the Octave day of the Epiphany, providing the date for the end of the season. Traditionally, the end of Christmastide was February 2, or the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, also known as Candlemas. This feast recounts the 40 days of rest Mary took before being purified and presenting her first-born son to the Temple in Jerusalem. In medieval times, Candlemas eve (Feb. 1st) marked the day when all Christmas decorations, including the Christmas tree and the Nativity scene, were taken down. However, the tradition of ending Christmastide on Candlemas has slowly waned, except in some pockets of the Hispanic world where Candlemas (or La Fiesta de la Candelaria) is still an important feast and the unofficial end of the Christmas season. Liturgical colour: white =Ordinary Time = \\"Ordinary\\" comes from the same root as our word \\"ordinal\\", and in this sense means \\"the counted weeks\\". In the Roman Catholic Church and in some Protestant traditions, these are the common weeks which do not belong to a proper season. In Latin, these seasons are called the weeks per annum, or \\"through the year\\". In the current form of the Roman Rite adopted following the Second Vatican Council, Ordinary Time consists of 33 or 34 Sundays and is divided into two sections. The first portion extends from the day following the Feast of the Baptism of Christ until the day before Ash Wednesday (the beginning of Lent). It contains anywhere from three to eight Sundays, depending on how early or late Easter falls. The main focus in the readings of the Mass is Christ's earthly ministry, rather than any one particular event. The counting of the Sundays resumes following Eastertide; however, two Sundays are replaced by Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, and depending on whether the year has 52 or 53 weeks, one may be omitted. In the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the Time after Epiphany has anywhere from one to six Sundays. As in the current form of the rite, the season mainly concerns Christ's preaching and ministry, with many of his parables read as the Gospel readings. The season begins on January 14 and ends on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday. Omitted Sundays after Epiphany are transferred to Time after Pentecost and celebrated between the Twenty-Third and the Last Sunday after Pentecost according to an order indicated in the Code of Rubrics, 18, with complete omission of any for which there is no Sunday available in the current year.\\"The Sunday which is set down as XXIV after Pentecost is always put in the last place, omitting, if need be, any others for which there happens to be no place\\" (1960 Code of Rubrics, 18). Before the 1960 revisions, the omitted Sunday would be celebrated on the Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday,\\"If this II Sunday, or another after Epiphany, be impeded by Septuagesima supervening, and there be no place for it after Pentecost, according to the Rubrics, it is anticipated on Saturday with all privileges proper to an occurring Sunday.\\" (Missale Romanum, 1939, Dominica II post Epiphaniam) or, in the case of the Twenty-Third Sunday after Pentecost, on the Saturday before the Last Sunday after Pentecost.\\"If this Sunday be impeded by the last Sunday after Pentecost supervening, it is anticipated on Saturday with all privileges proper to an occurring Sunday, and in it is said Gl√≥ria in exc√©lsis, Credo, Preface of the Trinity and Ite, Missa est.\\" (Missale Romanum, 1939, Dominica XXIII post Pentecosten) Liturgical colour: green =Septuagesima/Pre-Lenten Season= Septuagesima (from the Latin word for \\"seventieth\\") is a two-and-a-half-week period before Lent. This pre-Lent season is present in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite and in some Protestant calendars. It is a transition from the first part of the season per annum\\"The season per annum runs from January 14 to none of Saturday before Septuagesima Sunday\\" Code of Rubrics, 77 to the season of Lent, and a preparation for the fasting and penance which begin on Ash Wednesday. Although most of the Divine Office remains the same as during the season per annum, certain customs of Lent are adopted, including the suppression of the \\"Alleluia\\", the replacement of the Alleluia at Mass with the Tract and the Gloria is no longer said on Sundays. In the 1969 reform of the Roman Rite, this intermediate season was removed, with these weeks becoming part of Ordinary Time. Liturgical colour (where observed): violet or purple =Lent and Passiontide= Lent is a major penitential season of preparation for Easter. It begins on Ash Wednesday and, if the penitential days of Good Friday and Holy Saturday are included, lasts for forty days, since the six Sundays within the season are not counted. In the Roman Rite, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo and the Te Deum are not used in the Mass and Liturgy of the Hours respectively, except on Solemnities and Feasts, and the Alleluia and verse that usually precede the reading of the Gospel is either omitted or replaced with another acclamation. Lutheran churches make these same omissions. As in Advent, the deacon and subdeacon of the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite do not wear their habitual dalmatic and tunicle (signs of joy) in Masses of the season during Lent; instead they wear \\"folded chasubles\\", in accordance with the ancient custom. In the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the two weeks before Easter form the season of Passiontide, a subsection of the Lenten season that begins with Matins of Ash Wednesday and ends immediately before the Mass of the Easter Vigil.Code of Rubrics, 74 In this form, what used to be officially called Passion Sunday,Missale Romanum, 1920 typical edition, p. 156 has the official name of the First Sunday in Passiontide,Missale Romanum 1962, p. 118 and Palm Sunday has the additional name of the Second Sunday in Passiontide.Missale Romanum 1962, p. 130 In Sunday and ferial Masses (but not on feasts celebrated in the first of these two weeks) the Gloria Patri is omitted at the Entrance AntiphonCode of Rubrics, 428 and at the Lavabo,Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, VII, 6, in Missale Romanum 1962, p. LIX; cf. Missale Romanum 1962, p. 118 as well as in the responds in the Divine Office. In the post-1969 form of the Roman Rite, \\"Passion Sunday\\" and \\"Palm Sunday\\" are both names for the Sunday before Easter, officially called \\"Palm Sunday of the Lord's Passion\\". The former Passion Sunday became a fifth Sunday of Lent. The earlier form reads Matthew's account on Sunday, Mark's on Tuesday, and Luke's on Wednesday, while the post-1969 form reads the Passion only on Palm Sunday (with the three Synoptic Gospels arranged in a three-year cycle) and on Good Friday, when it reads the Passion according to John, as also do earlier forms of the Roman Rite. The veiling of crucifixes and images of the saints with violet cloth, which was obligatory before 1970, is left to the decision of the national bishops' conferences. In the United States, it is permitted but not required, at the discretion of the pastor. In all forms, the readings concern the events leading up to the Last Supper and the betrayal, Passion, and death of Christ. The week before Easter is called Holy Week. In the Roman Rite, feasts that fall within that week are simply omitted, unless they have the rank of Solemnity, in which case they are transferred to another date. The only solemnities inscribed in the General Calendar that can fall within that week are those of St. Joseph and the Annunciation. Liturgical colour: violet or purple. The colour rose may be used, where it is the practice, on Laetare Sunday (4th Sunday of Lent). On Palm Sunday the colour since 1970 is red, by earlier rules violet or purple, with red being used after 1955 for the blessing of the palms. =Easter Triduum= The Easter Triduum consists of Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. Each of these days begins liturgically not with the morning but with the preceding evening. The triduum begins on the evening before Good Friday with Mass of the Lord's Supper, celebrated with white vestments,Holy Thursday Evening Mass of the Lord's Supper, 44 and often includes a ritual of ceremonial footwashing. It is customary on this night for a vigil involving private prayer to take place, beginning after the evening service and continuing until midnight. This vigil is occasionally renewed at dawn, continuing until the Good Friday liturgy. During the day of Good Friday Mass is not celebrated in the Roman Catholic Church. Instead a Celebration of the Passion of the Lord is held in the afternoon or evening. It consists of three parts: a Liturgy of the Word that includes the reading of the account of the Passion by John the Evangelist and concludes with a solemn Universal Prayer. Other churches also have their Good Friday commemoration of the Passion. The colour of vestments varies: no colour, red, or black are used in different traditions. Coloured hangings may be removed. Lutheran churches often either remove colourful adornments and icons, or veil them with drab cloth. The service is usually plain with somber music, ending with the congregation leaving in silence. In the Roman Catholic, some Lutheran, and High Anglican rites, a crucifix (not necessarily the one which stands on or near the altar on other days of the year) is ceremoniously unveiled. Other crucifixes are unveiled, without ceremony, after the service. Holy Saturday commemorates the day during which Christ lay in the tomb. In the Roman Catholic Church, there is no Mass on this day; the Easter Vigil Mass, which, though celebrated properly at the following midnight, is often celebrated in the evening, is an Easter Mass. With no liturgical celebration, there is no question of a liturgical colour. The Easter Vigil is held in the night between Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday, to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus. See also Paschal candle. The liturgical colour is white, often together with gold. In the Roman Rite, during the \\"Gloria in Excelsis Deo\\" the organ and bells are used in the liturgy for the first time in 2 days, and the statues, which have been veiled during Passiontide (at least in the Roman Rite through the 1962 version), are unveiled. In Lutheran churches, colours and icons are re-displayed as well. =Eastertide= Easter is the celebration of Jesus' Resurrection. The date of Easter varies from year to year, according to a lunar-calendar dating system (see computus for details). In the Roman Rite, the Easter season extends from the Easter Vigil through Pentecost Sunday. In the pre-1970 form of the rite, this season includes also the Octave of Pentecost, so Eastertide lasts until None of the following Saturday. In the Roman Rite, the Easter octave allows no other feasts to be celebrated or commemorated during it; a solemnity, such as the Annunciation, falling within it is transferred to the following Monday. If Easter Sunday or Easter Monday falls on 25 April, the Greater Litanies, which in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite are on that day, are transferred to the following Tuesday.1960 Code of Rubrics, 80 By a decree of May 5, 2000, the Second Sunday of Easter (the Sunday after Easter Day itself), is known also in the Roman Rite as the Feast of the Divine Mercy.Our Sunday Visitor: Feast of the Divine Mercy Ascension Thursday, which celebrates the return of Jesus to heaven following his resurrection, is the fortieth day of Easter, but, in places where it is not observed as a Holy Day of Obligation, the post-1969 form of the Roman rite transfers it to the following Sunday. Pentecost is the fiftieth and last day of the Easter season. It celebrates the sending of the Holy Spirit to the Apostles, which traditionally marks the birth of the Church, see also Apostolic Age. Liturgical colour: white, but red on the feast of Pentecost. =Ordinary Time, Time after Pentecost, Time after Trinity, or Kingdomtide= This season, under various names, follows the Easter season and the feasts of Easter, Ascension, and Pentecost. In the post-1969 form of the Roman rite, Ordinary Time resumes on Pentecost Monday, omitting the Sunday which would have fallen on Pentecost. In the earlier form, where Pentecost is celebrated with an octave, the Time after Pentecost begins at Vespers on the Saturday after Pentecost. The Sundays resume their numbering at the point that will make the Sunday before Advent the thirty-fourth, omitting any weeks for which there is no room (present-day form of the Roman Rite) or are numbered as \\"Sundays after Pentecost\\" (pre-1970 Roman Rite, Eastern Orthodoxy and some Protestants) or as \\"Sundays after Trinity\\" (some Protestants). This season ends on the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent. Feasts during this season include: * Trinity Sunday, the first Sunday after Pentecost. * Corpus Christi (Roman Rite and some Anglican and Lutheran traditions), Thursday of the second week after Pentecost, often celebrated on the following Sunday. * Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (Roman Rite), Friday in the third week after Pentecost. * World Day of the Poor, 33rd Sunday of Ordinary Time. * Feast of Christ the King, last Sunday before Advent (Roman Rite, Lutherans, Anglicans) or last Sunday in October (1925‚Äì1969 form of the Roman Rite). In the final few weeks of Ordinary Time, many churches direct attention to the coming of the Kingdom of God, thus ending the liturgical year with an eschatological theme that is one of the predominant themes of the season of Advent that began the liturgical year. For instance, in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite, the Gospel of the Last Sunday is and in the later form of that rite all the last three Sundays have similar themes. While the Roman Rite adopts no special designation for this final part of Ordinary Time, some denominations do, and may also change the liturgical colour. The Church of England uses the term \\"Sundays before Advent\\" for the final four Sundays and permits red vestments as an alternative. Other denominations, including the United Methodist Church and the Christian Church - Synod of Saint Timothy, speak of \\"Kingdomtide\\". The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod (LCMS) uses the terms \\"Third-Last, Second-Last and Last Sunday in the Church Year\\" and does not change from green. The LCMS does not officially celebrate a \\"Feast of Christ the King.\\" The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS) uses the term \\"Period of End Times\\" and assigns red vestments to the first and second Sundays. =Calendar of saints= * In some Protestant traditions, especially those with closer ties to the Lutheran tradition, Reformation Sunday is celebrated on the Sunday preceding October 31, commemorating the purported day Martin Luther posted the 95 Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The liturgical colour is red, celebrating the Holy Spirit's continuing work in renewing the Church. * Most Western traditions celebrate All Saints' Day (All Hallow's Day) on November 1 or the Sunday following, with the eve of this feast, All Hallow's Eve being October 31. The liturgical colour is white. The following day, November 2, is All Souls' Day. The period including these days is often referred to as Allhallowtide or Allsaintstide. * Saints Days are observed by Lutherans and include the apostles, Virgin Mary and noteworthy figures in the Christian faith. The Confession of St. Peter Week of Prayer for Christian Unity starting on January 18. Conversion of St. Paul ended week of prayer on January 25. Martin Luther King Jr., renewer of society, martyr January 15 (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America only), Presentation of Our Lord and Purification of the Mary Candlemas on February 2. Joseph, Guardian of Jesus St Joseph on March 19, Annunciation March 25, Visitation of Mary on May 31. * Lutherans also celebrate St John the Baptist or the Beheading of St John the Baptist on June 24, St Mary Magdalene July 22, St. Mary, Mother of Our Lord or the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on August 15, Holy Cross Day September 14, Francis of Assisi, renewal of the Church St. Francis of Assisi on October 4, and the Holy Innocents, Martyrs December 28. * Lesser Feasts and Commemorations on the Lutheran liturgical calendar include Anthony of Egypt on January 17, Henry, Bishop of Uppsala, martyr Henry of Uppsala on January 19, Timothy, Titus and Silas, missionaries St Timothy, St Titus and St Silas Day on January 26, Ansgar, Bishop of Hamburg, missionary to Denmark and Sweden St Ansgar on February 3, Cyril, monk and Methodius, bishop, missionaries to the Slavs St Cyril and St Methodius on February 14, Gregory the Great on March 12, St Patrick on March 17, Olavus Petri, priest and Laurentius Petri, Bishop of Uppsala, on April 19, St Anselm on April 21, Catherine of Siena on April 29, St Athanasius on May 2, St Monica on May 4, Eric IX of Sweden on May 18, St Boniface on June 5, Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus on June 14, Benedict of Nursia on July 11, Birgitta of Sweden on July 23, St Anne, Mother of Mary on July 26, St Dominic on August 8, Augustine of Hippo on August 28, St Cyprian on September 16, Teresa of Avila on October 15, Martin de Porres on November 3, Martin of Tours on November 11, Elizabeth of Hungary on November 17, St Lucy on December 13. There are many other holy days in the Lutheran calendar. * Some traditions celebrate St. Michael's Day (Michaelmas) on September 29. * Some traditions celebrate St. Martin's Day (Martinmas) on November 11. Liturgical colours: white if the saint was not martyred; red if the saint was martyred Hierarchy of feast days There are degrees of solemnity of the office of the feast days of saints. In the 13th century, the Roman Rite distinguished three ranks: simple, semidouble and double, with consequent differences in the recitation of the Divine Office or Breviary. The simple feast commenced with the chapter (capitulum) of First Vespers, and ended with None. It had three lessons and took the psalms of Matins from the ferial office; the rest of the office was like the semidouble. The semidouble feast had two Vespers, nine lessons in Matins, and ended with Compline. The antiphons before the psalms were only intoned. In the Mass, the semidouble had always at least three \\"orationes\\" or collects. On a double feast the antiphons were sung in their entirety, before and after the psalms, while in Lauds and Vespers there were no suffragia of the saints, and the Mass had only one \\"oratio\\" (if no commemoration was prescribed). If ordinary double feasts (referred to also as lesser doubles) occurred with feasts of a higher rank, they could be simplified, except the octave days of some feasts and the feasts of the Doctors of the Church, which were transferred. To the existing distinction between major and ordinary or minor doubles, Pope Clement VIII added two more ranks, those of first-class or second-class doubles. Some of these two classes were kept with octaves. This was still the situation when the 1907 article Ecclesiastical Feasts in the Catholic Encyclopedia was written. In accordance with the rules then in force, feast days of any form of double, if impeded by \\"occurrence\\" (falling on the same day) with a feast day of higher class, were transferred to another day. Pope Pius X simplified matters considerably in his 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary. In the case of occurrence the lower-ranking feast day could become a commemoration within the celebration of the higher-ranking one. Until then, ordinary doubles took precedence over most of the semidouble Sundays, resulting in many of the Sunday Masses rarely being said. While retaining the semidouble rite for Sundays, Pius X's reform permitted only the most important feast days to be celebrated on Sunday, although commemorations were still made until Pope John XXIII's reform of 1960. The division into doubles (of various kinds) semidoubles and simples continued until 1955, when Pope Pius XII abolished the rank of semidouble, making all the previous semidoubles simples, and reducing the previous simples to a mere commemoration in the Mass of another feast day or of the feria on which they fell (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII). Then, in 1960, Pope John XXIII issued the Code of Rubrics, completely ending the ranking of feast days by doubles etc., and replacing it by a ranking, applied not only to feast days but to all liturgical days, as I, II, III, and IV class days. The 1969 revision by Pope Paul VI divided feast days into \\"solemnities\\", \\"feasts\\" and \\"memorials\\", corresponding approximately to Pope John XXIII's I, II and III class feast days. Commemorations were abolished. While some of the memorials are considered obligatory, others are optional, permitting a choice on some days between two or three memorials, or between one or more memorials and the celebration of the feria. On a day to which no obligatory celebration is assigned, the Mass may be of any saint mentioned in the Roman Martyrology for that day.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355 c Assumption of Mary Observed by Roman Catholics and some Anglicans on August 15, which is the same as the Eastern and Orthodox feast of the Dormition, the end of the earthly life of the Virgin Mary and, for some, her bodily Assumption into heaven, is celebrated. The Roman Catholic teaching on this feast was defined as dogma on November 1, 1950 by Pope Pius XII in the Papal Bull, Munificentissimus Deus. In other Anglican and Lutheran traditions, as well as a few others, August 15 is celebrated as St. Mary, Mother of the Lord. Liturgical colour: white Secular observance Because of the dominance of Christianity in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, many features of the Christian year became incorporated into the secular calendar. Many of its feasts (e.g., Christmas, Mardi Gras, Saint Patrick's Day) remain holidays, and are now celebrated by people of all faiths and none ‚Äî in some cases worldwide. The secular celebrations bear varying degrees of likeness to the religious feasts from which they derived, often also including elements of ritual from pagan festivals of similar date.

The word is often applied only to those that are edible and live as infauna, spending most of their lives halfway buried in the sand of the seafloor or riverbeds. Clams have two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and have a powerful burrowing foot. They live in both freshwater and marine environments; in salt water they prefer to burrow down into the mud and the turbidity of the water required varies with species and location; the greatest diversity of these is in North America.https://www.wildbunnysland.com/can-you-eat-freshwater- clams/http://www.eattheweeds.com/musseling- in/https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/clams/mussels.html Clams in the culinary sense do not live attached to a substrate (whereas oysters and mussels do) and do not live near the bottom (whereas scallops do). In culinary usage, clams are commonly eaten marine bivalves, as in clam digging and the resulting soup, clam chowder. Many edible clams such as palourde clams are oval or triangular; however, razor clams have an elongated parallel-sided shell, suggesting an old-fashioned straight razor. Some clams have life cycles of only one year, while at least one may be over 500 years old. All clams have two calcareous shells or valves joined near a hinge with a flexible ligament and all are filter feeders.  Anatomy  Littleneck clams, small hard clams, species Mercenaria mercenaria A clam's shell consists of two (usually equal) valves, which are connected by a hinge joint and a ligament that can be external or internal. The ligament provides tension to bring the valves apart, while one or two adductor muscles can contract to close the valves. Clams also have kidneys, a heart, a mouth, a stomach, and a nervous system. Many have a siphon.  Food source and ecology  A clam dish Clams simmering in a white wine sauce Clams are shellfish that make up an important part of the web of life that keeps the seas functioning, both as filter feeders and as a food source for many different animals.https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/education/documents/Marine%20Foodweb%20Handout.pdf Extant mammals that eat clams would include both the Pacific and Atlantic species of walrus, all known subspecies of harbour seals in both the Atlantic and Pacific, most species of sea lions, including the California sea lion, bearded seals, and even species of river otters that will consume the freshwater species found in Asia and North America.https://www.westsoundwildlife.org/wildlife/FunFacts/FF_RiverOtters.html.https://www.marwell.org.uk/zoo/explore/animals/61/asian- small-clawed-otter Birds of all kinds will also eat clams if they can catch them in the littoral zone: roseate spoonbills of North and South America,https://ambergriscaye.com/birds/roseate.html the Eurasian oystercatcher, whooping cranehttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/w/whooping-crane/ and common crane, the American flamingo of Florida and the Caribbean Sea,http://www.geographia.com/bonaire/bonbrd01.htm and the common sandpiper are just a handful of the numerous birds that feast on clams all over the world. Most species of octopus have clams as a staple of their diet, up to and including the giants like the Giant Pacific octopus.  Culinary  Cultures around the world eat clams along with many other types of shellfish.  North America  In culinary use, within the eastern coast of the United States and large swathes of the Maritimes of Canada, the term \\"clam\\" most often refers to the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria. It may also refer to a few other common edible species, such as the soft-shell clam, Mya arenaria and the ocean quahog, Arctica islandica. Another species commercially exploited on the Atlantic Coast of the United States is the surf clam Spisula solidissima. Scallops are also used for food nationwide, but not cockles: they are more difficult to get than in Europe because of their habit of being farther out in the tide than European species on the West Coast, and on the East Coast they are often found in salt marshes and mudflats where mosquitoes are abundant. That being said, for the brave and for the heavily drenched in DEET based bug repellant, there are several edible species in the East: Americardia media, also known as the strawberry cockle, is found from Cape Hatteras down into the Caribbean Sea and all of Florida. Trachycardium muricatum has a similar range to the strawberry cockle. And Dinocardium robustum by far grows to be many times the size of the European cockle; it is large enough to be the size of a woman's hand. Historically and on a small scale, the barrier islands of North Carolina known as the Outer Banks would catch these species and put them in soups or steam them; other recipes from the past recommend pickling. Up and down the coast of the Eastern U.S., the bamboo clam, ensis directus, is prized by Americans for making clam strips although because of its nature of burrowing into the sand very close to the beach, it cannot be harvested by mechanical means without damaging the beaches. The bamboo clam is also notorious for having a very sharp edge of its shell, and when harvested by hand must be handled with great care. On the U.S. West Coast, there are several species that have been consumed for thousands of years, evidenced by middens full of clamshells near the shore and their consumption by nations including the Chumash of California, the Nisqually of Washington state and the Tsawwassen of British Columbia. The butter clam, Saxidomus gigantea, the Pacific razor clam, Siliqua patula, gaper clams Tresus capax, the geoduck clam, Panopea generosa and the Pismo clam, Tivela stultorum are all eaten as delicacies. Clams can be eaten raw, steamed, boiled, baked or fried. They can also be made into clam chowder, clams casino, Clam cakes, stuffies, or they can be cooked using hot rocks and seaweed in a New England clam bake. On the West Coast, they are an ingredient in making cioppino and local variants of ceviche Asia = India = Clams are eaten more in the coastal regions of India, especially in the Konkan, Kerala, Bengal and coastal regions of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu regions. In Kerala clams are used to make curries and fried with coconut. In Malabar region it is known as \\"elambakka\\" and in middle kerala it is known as \\"kakka\\". Clam curry made with coconut is a dish from Malabar especially in the Thalassery region. On the south western coast of India, also known as the Konkan region of Maharashtra, clams are used in curries and side dishes, like Tisaryachi Ekshipi, which is clams with one shell on. Beary Muslim households in the Mangalore region prepare a main dish with clams called Kowldo Pinde. In Udupi and Mangalore regions it is famously called as \\"marvai\\" in local tulu language. It is used to prepare many delicious dishes like marvai sukka, marvai gassi, and marvai pundi. = Japan = In Japan, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes. They can also be made into hot pot, miso soup or Tsukudani. The more commonly used varieties of clams in Japanese cooking are the Shijimi (Corbicula japonica), the Asari (Venerupis philippinarum) and the Hamaguri (Meretrix lusoria). Europe = Great Britain = The rocky terrain and pebbly shores of the seacoast that surrounds the entire island provides ample habitat for shellfish, and clams are most definitely included in that description. The oddity here is that for a nation whose fortunes have been tied to the sea for hundreds of years, 70% of the seafood cultivated for aquaculture or commercial harvesting is exported to the Continent.https://www.undercurrentnews.com/2019/04/10/trade-insights-more- than-70-of-uk-seafood-exports-go-to-eu/ Historically, Britain has been an island most famous of all for its passion for beef and dairy products, although there is evidence going back to before most recorded history of coastal shell middens near Weymouth and present day York. (There is also evidence of more thriving local trade in sea products in general by noting the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers was founded in 1272 in London.) Present day younger populations are eating more of the catch than a generation ago, and there is a prevalence of YouTube videos of locavore scavenging, however the numbers have a long way to go before they match the numbers consumed in Mesolithic, as evidenced by the strikingly large number of shells found in said middens. Staple favourites of the British public and local scavengers would include the razorfish, Ensis siliqua, a slightly smaller cousin of the bamboo clam of Eastern North America.https://britishseafishing.co.uk/razorfish/ These can be found for sale in open air markets like Billingsgate Market in London; they have a similar taste to their North American cousin.https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-razor- clams-on-display-in-billingsgate-fish-market-london-74063195.html Cockles, specifically the common cockle, are a staple find on beaches in western Wales and farther north in the Dee Estuary. The accidentally introduced hard shell mercenaria mercenaria is also found in British waters, mainly those near England, and does see some use in British cookpots. The Palourde clam by far is the most common native clam and it is both commercially harvested as well as locally collected and Spisula solida, the relative of the Atlantic surf clam on the other side of the Atlantic, is seeing increased interest as a food source and aquaculture candidate; it is mainly found in the British Isles in Europe. = Italy = In Italy, clams are often an ingredient of mixed seafood dishes or are eaten together with pasta. The more commonly used varieties of clams in Italian cooking are the Vongola (Venerupis decussata), the Cozza (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and the Tellina (Donax trunculus). Though Dattero di mare (Lithophaga lithophaga) was once eaten, overfishing drove it to the verge of extinction (it takes 15 to 35 years to reach adult size and could only be harvested by smashing the calcarean rocks that form its habitat) and the Italian government has declared it an endangered species since 1998 and its harvest and sale are forbidden.  Religion  In Judaism, clams are considered non-kosher (treif); but in Islam, clams are considered Haram along with all other shellfish, which lack a fish's fins and scales.Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 83 and 84  As currency  Some species of clams, particularly Mercenaria mercenaria, were in the past used by the Algonquians of Eastern North America to manufacture wampum, a type of sacred jewellery; and to make shell money.

In British English, the term jumper describes what is called a sweater in American English. Also, in more formal British usage, a distinction is made between a pinafore dress and a pinafore. The latter, though a related garment, has an open back and is worn as an apron. In American English, pinafore always refers to an apron. A sundress, like a jumper, is sleeveless and collarless; however, such articles are not worn over a blouse or sweater, and are of distinctly different cuts and fashions. The apron dress may be viewed as a special case of the jumper. If the design of the dress is directly inspired by an apron (having a bib in front and ties in the back, for example), the garment is typically described as an apron dress.  History  Jumpers for fall were described in The Fort Wayne Sentinel in 1906. The dresses were \\"imported from Paris\\" and featured \\"original lines.\\" Jumpers in the United States were part of the sportswear collections of Jean Patou, Coco Chanel and Paul Poiret. Suzanne Lenglen wore Patou's jumper design in the 1920s. The dresses, worn over blouses, became popular during the decade of the 1920s. Jumpers were often worn in the summer and made out of various types of fabrics. Jumpers were touted as an \\"American\\" and a \\"sports fashion\\" in 1930 by the Pittsburgh Press. The dresses were also praised for allowing women to create color combinations through the choice of blouse worn underneath. Jumpers were again popularized in 1953, when Hubert de Givenchy promoted his own jumper.

The hazards addressed by protective equipment include physical, electrical, heat, chemicals, biohazards, and airborne particulate matter. Protective equipment may be worn for job-related occupational safety and health purposes, as well as for sports and other recreational activities. \\"Protective clothing\\" is applied to traditional categories of clothing, and \\"protective gear\\" applies to items such as pads, guards, shields, or masks, and others. PPE suits can be similar in appearance to a cleanroom suit. The purpose of personal protective equipment is to reduce employee exposure to hazards when engineering controls and administrative controls are not feasible or effective to reduce these risks to acceptable levels. PPE is needed when there are hazards present. PPE has the serious limitation that it does not eliminate the hazard at the source and may result in employees being exposed to the hazard if the equipment fails. Personal Protective Equipment Any item of PPE imposes a barrier between the wearer/user and the working environment. This can create additional strains on the wearer; impair their ability to carry out their work and create significant levels of discomfort. Any of these can discourage wearers from using PPE correctly, therefore placing them at risk of injury, ill-health or, under extreme circumstances, death. Good ergonomic design can help to minimise these barriers and can therefore help to ensure safe and healthy working conditions through the correct use of PPE. Practices of occupational safety and health can use hazard controls and interventions to mitigate workplace hazards, which pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of workers. The hierarchy of hazard controls provides a policy framework which ranks the types of hazard controls in terms of absolute risk reduction. At the top of the hierarchy are elimination and substitution, which remove the hazard entirely or replace the hazard with a safer alternative. If elimination or substitution measures cannot apply, engineering controls and administrative controls, which seek to design safer mechanisms and coach safer human behavior, are implemented. Personal protective equipment ranks last on the hierarchy of controls, as the workers are regularly exposed to the hazard, with a barrier of protection. The hierarchy of controls is important in acknowledging that, while personal protective equipment has tremendous utility, it is not the desired mechanism of control in terms of worker safety. History A 1568 painting depicting beekeepers in protective clothing, by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. Early PPE such as body armor, boots and gloves focused on protecting the wearer's body from physical injury. The plague doctors of sixteenth-century Europe also wore protective uniforms consisting of a full-length gown, helmet, glass eye coverings, gloves and boots (see Plague doctor costume) to prevent contagion when dealing with plague victims. These were made of thick material which was then covered in wax to make it water-resistant. A mask with a beak-like structure which was filled with pleasant-smelling flowers, herbs and spices to prevent the spread of miasma, the prescientific belief of bad smells which spread disease through the air. In more recent years, scientific personal protective equipment is generally believed to have begun with the cloth facemasks promoted by Wu Lien- teh in the 1910‚Äì11 Manchurian pneumonic plague outbreak, although many Western medics doubted the efficacy of facemasks in preventing the spread of disease. Types Personal protective equipment can be categorized by the area of the body protected, by the types of hazard, and by the type of garment or accessory. A single item, for example boots, may provide multiple forms of protection: a steel toe cap and steel insoles for protection of the feet from crushing or puncture injuries, impervious rubber and lining for protection from water and chemicals, high reflectivity and heat resistance for protection from radiant heat, and high electrical resistivity for protection from electric shock. The protective attributes of each piece of equipment must be compared with the hazards expected to be found in the workplace. More breathable types of personal protective equipment may not lead to more contamination but do result in greater user satisfaction. Respirators Air-purifying respirator N95 mask Respirators serve to protect the user from breathing in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type of respirator functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user.Respirators . National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The filtration may be either passive or active (powered). Gas masks and particulate respirators (like N95 masks) are examples of this type of respirator. A second type of respirator protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate. In the United Kingdom, an organization that has extensive expertise in respiratory protective equipment is the Institute of Occupational Medicine. This expertise has been built on a long-standing and varied research programme that has included the setting of workplace protection factors to the assessment of efficacy of masks available through high street retail outlets. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), NHS Health Scotland and Healthy Working Lives (HWL) have jointly developed the RPE (Respiratory Protective Equipment) Selector Tool, which is web-based. This interactive tool provides descriptions of different types of respirators and breathing apparatuses, as well as \\"dos and don'ts\\" for each type.\\"Selecting the right Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) for the job\\". Healthy Working Lives. 2008-4-4 In the United States, The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provides recommendations on respirator use, in accordance to NIOSH federal respiratory regulations 42 CFR Part 84. The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) of NIOSH is tasked towards actively conducting studies on respirators and providing recommendations.CDC - NIOSH - Respirator Fact Sheet . The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory. Surgical masks are considered as PPE, but are not considered as respirators, being unable to stop submicron particles from passing through, and also having unrestricted air flow at the edges of the masks. Skin protection A worker wearing a respirator, lab coat, and gloves while weighing carbon nanotubes glove and the lab coat exposes the wrist to hazardous materials. Occupational skin diseases such as contact dermatitis, skin cancers, and other skin injuries and infections are the second-most common type of occupational disease and can be very costly.CDC - Skin Exposures and Effects - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Skin hazards, which lead to occupational skin disease, can be classified into four groups. Chemical agents can come into contact with the skin through direct contact with contaminated surfaces, deposition of aerosols, immersion or splashes. Physical agents such as extreme temperatures and ultraviolet or solar radiation can be damaging to the skin over prolonged exposure. Mechanical trauma occurs in the form of friction, pressure, abrasions, lacerations and contusions. Biological agents such as parasites, microorganisms, plants and animals can have varied effects when exposed to the skin. Any form of PPE that acts as a barrier between the skin and the agent of exposure can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, gloves are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include rubber gloves, cut-resistant gloves, chainsaw gloves and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma. Other than gloves, any other article of clothing or protection worn for a purpose serve to protect the skin. Lab coats for example, are worn to protect against potential splashes of chemicals. Face shields serve to protect one's face from potential impact hazards, chemical splashes or possible infectious fluid. Many migrant workers need training in PPE for Heat Related Illnesses prevention (HRI). Based on study results, the research identified some potential gaps in heat safety education. While some farm workers reported receiving limited training on pesticide safety, incoming groups of farmer workers could also receive video and in-person training on HRI prevention. These educational programs for farm workers are most effective then they are based on health behavior theories, use adult learning principles and employ train-the-trainer approaches. Eye protection A paintball player wearing appropriate eye protection against impact. Each day, about 2000 US workers have a job-related eye injury that requires medical attention.CDC - Eye Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Eye injuries can happen through a variety of means. Most eye injuries occur when solid particles such as metal slivers, wood chips, sand or cement chips get into the eye. Smaller particles in smokes and larger particles such as broken glass also account for particulate matter- causing eye injuries. Blunt force trauma can occur to the eye when excessive force comes into contact with the eye. Chemical burns, biological agents, and thermal agents, from sources such as welding torches and UV light, also contribute to occupational eye injury.CDC - Eye Safety - Eye Safety for Emergency Response and Disaster Recovery . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. While the required eye protection varies by occupation, the safety provided can be generalized. Safety glasses provide protection from external debris, and should provide side protection via a wrap-around design or side shields. * Goggles provide better protection than safety glasses, and are effective in preventing eye injury from chemical splashes, impact, dusty environments and welding. Goggles with high air flow should be used to prevent fogging. * Face shields provide additional protection and are worn over the standard eyewear; they also provide protection from impact, chemical, and blood-borne hazards. * Full-facepiece respirators are considered the best form of eye protection when respiratory protection is needed as well, but may be less effective against potential impact hazards to the eye. * Eye protection for welding is shaded to different degrees, depending on the specific operation. Hearing protection Industrial noise is often overlooked as an occupational hazard, as it is not visible to the eye. Overall, about 22 million workers in the United States are exposed to potentially damaging noise levels each year.CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Facts and Statistics - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic . The National Institute for Occuaptional Safety and Health. Occupational hearing loss accounted for 14% of all occupational illnesses in 2007, with about 23,000 cases significant enough to cause permanent hearing impairment. About 82% of occupational hearing loss cases occurred to workers in the manufacturing sector. In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration establishes occupational noise exposure standards.Occupational noise exposure - 1910.95 . The Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that worker exposures to noise be reduced to a level equivalent to 85 dBA for eight hours to reduce occupational noise-induced hearing loss.Criteria for a Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure . DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 98-126. PPE for hearing protection consists of earplugs and earmuffs. Workers who are regularly exposed to noise levels above the NIOSH recommendation should be furnished hearing protection by the employers, as they are a low-cost intervention. A personal attenuation rating can be objectively measured through a hearing protection fit-testing system. The effectiveness of hearing protection varies with the training offered on their use. Protective clothing and ensembles Locker containing personal protective equipmentA complete PPE ensemble worn during high pressure cleaning work This form of PPE is all-encompassing and refers to the various suits and uniforms worn to protect the user from harm. Lab coats worn by scientists and ballistic vests worn by law enforcement officials, which are worn on a regular basis, would fall into this category. Entire sets of PPE, worn together in a combined suit, are also in this category. =Ensembles= Below are some examples of ensembles of personal protective equipment, worn together for a specific occupation or task, to provide maximum protection for the user. * PPE gowns are used by medical personnel like doctors and nurses, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. * Chainsaw protection (especially a helmet with face guard, hearing protection, kevlar chaps, anti-vibration gloves, and chainsaw safety boots). * Bee-keepers wear various levels of protection depending on the temperament of their bees and the reaction of the bees to nectar availability. At minimum most bee keepers wear a brimmed hat and a veil made of fine mesh netting. The next level of protection involves leather gloves with long gauntlets and some way of keeping bees from crawling up one's trouser legs. In extreme cases, specially fabricated shirts and trousers can serve as barriers to the bees' stingers. * Diving equipment, for underwater diving, constitutes equipment such as a diving helmet or diving mask, an underwater breathing apparatus, and a diving suit. * Firefighters wear PPE designed to provide protection against fires and various fumes and gases. PPE worn by firefighters include bunker gear, self-contained breathing apparatus, a helmet, safety boots, and a PASS device. =In sports= Participants in sports often wear protective equipment. Studies performed on the injuries of professional athletes, such as that on NFL players,CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - Brain Injury in the NFL . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. question the effectiveness of existing personal protective equipment. Limits of the definition Workers using personal protective equipment while painting poles. While basic head protection is present, no engineering fall protection systems appear to be in place. The definition of what constitutes personal protective equipment varies by country. In the United States, the laws regarding PPE also vary by state. In 2011, workplace safety complaints were brought against Hustler and other adult film production companies by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, leading to several citations brought by Cal/OSHA. The failure to use condoms by adult film stars was a violation of Cal/OSHA's Blood borne Pathogens Program, Personal Protective Equipment. This example shows that personal protective equipment can cover a variety of occupations in the United States, and has a wide-ranging definition. Legislation in the European Union At the European Union level, personal protective equipment is governed by Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment (PPE). The Directive is designed to ensure that PPE meets common quality and safety standards by setting out basic safety requirements for personal protective equipment, as well as conditions for its placement on the market and free movement within the EU single market. It covers ‚Äòany device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards‚Äô. The directive was adopted on 21 January 1989 and came into force on 1 July 1992. The European Commission additionally allowed for a transition period until 30 June 1995 to give companies sufficient time to adapt to the legislation. After this date, all PPE placed on the market in EU Member States was required to comply with the requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC and carry the CE Marking. Article 1 of Directive 89/686/EEC defines personal protective equipment as any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards. PPE which falls under the scope of the Directive is divided into three categories: * Category I: simple design (e.g. gardening gloves, footwear, ski goggles) * Category II: PPE not falling into category I or III (e.g. personal flotation devices, dry and wet suits, motorcycle personal protective equipment) * Category III: complex design (e.g. respiratory equipment, harnesses) Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment does not distinguish between PPE for professional use and PPE for leisure purposes. Personal protective equipment falling within the scope of the Directive must comply with the basic health and safety requirements set out in Annex II of the Directive. To facilitate conformity with these requirements, harmonized standards are developed at the European or international level by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN, CENELEC) and the International Organization for Standardization in relation to the design and manufacture of the product. Usage of the harmonized standards is voluntary and provides presumption of conformity. However, manufacturers may choose an alternative method of complying with the requirements of the Directive. Personal protective equipment excluded from the scope of the Directive includes: * PPE designed for and used by the armed forces or in the maintenance of law and order; * PPE for self-defence (e.g. aerosol canisters, personal deterrent weapons); * PPE designed and manufactured for personal use against adverse atmospheric conditions (e.g. seasonal clothing, umbrellas), damp and water (e.g. dish-washing gloves) and heat; * PPE used on vessels and aircraft but not worn at all times; * helmets and visors intended for users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles. The European Commission is currently working to revise Directive 89/686/EEC. The revision will look at the scope of the Directive, the conformity assessment procedures and technical requirements regarding market surveillance. It will also align the Directive with the New Legislative Framework. The European Commission is likely to publish its proposal in 2013. It will then be discussed by the European Parliament and Council of the European Union under the ordinary legislative procedure before being published in the Official Journal of the European Union and becoming law. Research Research studies in the form of randomized controlled trials and simulation studies are needed to determine the most effective types of PPE for preventing the transmission of infectious diseases to healthcare workers. There is low quality evidence that supports making improvements or modifications to personal protective equipment in order to help decrease contamination. Examples of modifications include adding tabs to masks or gloves to ease removal and designing protective gowns so that gloves are removed at the same time. In addition, there is weak evidence that the following PPE approaches or techniques may lead to reduced contamination and improved compliance with PPE protocols: Wearing double gloves, following specific doffing (removal) procedures such as those from the CDC, and providing people with spoken instructions while removing PPE.

Description What is regarded as conventional sex depends on cultural and subcultural norms. Among heterosexual couples in the Western world, for example, conventional sex often refers to sexual intercourse in the missionary position. It can also describe penetrative sex which does not have any element of BDSM, kink or fetish. The British Medical Journal regards conventional sex between homosexual couples as \\"sex that does not extend beyond affection, mutual masturbation, and oral and anal sex.\\" In addition to mutual masturbation, penetrative sexual activity among same-sex pairings is contrasted by non-insertive acts such as intercrural sex, frot and tribadism, although tribadism has been cited as a common but rarely discussed sexual practice among lesbians. Vanilla sexuality The term \\"vanilla\\" in \\"vanilla sex\\" derives from the use of vanilla extract as the basic flavoring for ice cream, and by extension, meaning plain or conventional. In relationships where only one partner enjoys less conventional forms of sexual expression, the partner who does not enjoy such activities as much as the other is often referred to as the vanilla partner. As such, it is easy for them to be erroneously branded unadventurous in sexual matters. Paper on the difficulties facing \\"vanilla partners\\". .

It is also the administrative center of the Odessa Oblast and a multiethnic cultural center. Odessa is sometimes called the \\"pearl of the Black Sea\\", the \\"South Capital\\" (under the Russian Empire and Soviet Union), and \\"Southern Palmyra\\". Before the Tsarist establishment of Odessa, an ancient Greek settlement existed at its location. A more recent Tatar settlement was also founded at the location by Hacƒ± I Giray, the Khan of Crimea in 1440 that was named after him as Hacibey (or Khadjibey).Pultar, Gonul. After a period of Lithuanian Grand Duchy control, Hacibey and surroundings became part of the domain of the Ottomans in 1529 and remained there until the empire's defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1792. In 1794, the city of Odessa was founded by a decree of the Russian empress Catherine the Great. From 1819 to 1858, Odessa was a free port‚Äîa porto-franco. During the Soviet period, it was the most important port of trade in the Soviet Union and a Soviet naval base. On 1 January 2000, the Quarantine Pier at Odessa Commercial Sea Port was declared a free port and free economic zone for a period of 25 years. During the 19th century, Odessa was the fourth largest city of Imperial Russia, after Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Warsaw. Its historical architecture has a style more Mediterranean than Russian, having been heavily influenced by French and Italian styles. Some buildings are built in a mixture of different styles, including Art Nouveau, Renaissance and Classicist. Odessa is a warm-water port. The city of Odessa hosts both the Port of Odessa and Port Yuzhne, a significant oil terminal situated in the city's suburbs. Another notable port, Chornomorsk, is located in the same oblast, to the south-west of Odessa. Together they represent a major transport hub integrating with railways. Odessa's oil and chemical processing facilities are connected to Russian and European networks by strategic pipelines.  Name  The city was named in compliance with the Greek Plan of Catherine the Great. It was named after the ancient Greek city of Odessos, which was mistakenly believed to have been located here. Odessa is located in between the ancient Greek cities of Tyras and Olbia, different from the ancient Odessos's location further west along the coast, which is at present day Varna, Bulgaria. Catherine's secretary of state claimed in his memoirs that the name was his suggestion. Some expressed doubts about this claim, while others noted the reputation of Gribovsky as an honest and modest man.\\"Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors\\", The Ukrainian Week, 18 November 2014 (retrieved 2 August 2015)  History   Early history  Remains of ancient Greek settlement (under glass roof) on Primorsky Boulevard in Odessa Odessa was the site of a large Greek settlement no later than the middle of the 6th century BC (a necropolis from the 5th‚Äì3rd centuries BC has long been known in this area). Some scholars believe it to have been a trade settlement established by the Greek city of Histria. Whether the Bay of Odessa is the ancient \\"Port of the Histrians\\" cannot yet be considered a settled question based on the available evidence.\\"The Greek Colonisation of the Black Sea Area: Historical Interpretation of Archaeology,\\" December 1998, Tsetskhladze, Gocha R. (ed.), Franz Steiner Verlag, p. 41, n. 116. Archaeological artifacts confirm extensive links between the Odessa area and the eastern Mediterranean. In the Middle Ages successive rulers of the Odessa region included various nomadic tribes (Petchenegs, Cumans), the Golden Horde, the Crimean Khanate, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and the Ottoman Empire. Yedisan Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century. Since middle of the 13th century the city's territory belonged to the Golden Horde domain.Vermenych, Ya. Odessa (–û–î–ï–°–ê). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. 2010. On Italian navigational maps of 14th century on the place of Odessa is indicated the castle of Ginestra (more Gazaria (Genoese colonies)). At times when the Northern Black Sea littoral was controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, there existed a settlement of Kachibei which at first was mentioned in 1415. By middle of 15th century the settlement was depopulated. During the reign of Khan Hacƒ± I Giray of Crimea (1441‚Äì1466), the Khanate was endangered by the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks and, in search of allies, the khan agreed to cede the area to Lithuania. The site of present-day Odessa was then a fortress known as Khadjibey (named for Hacƒ± I Giray, and also spelled Kocibey in English, Hacƒ±bey or Hocabey in Turkish, and Hacƒ±bey in Crimean Tatar).  Ottoman Silistre  Khadjibey came under direct control of the Ottoman Empire after 1529 as part of a region known as Yedisan after one of Nogay Hordes, and was administered in the Ottoman Silistra (√ñzi) Eyalet, Sanjak of √ñzi. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans rebuilt the fortress at Khadjibey (also was known Hocabey), which was named Yeni D√ºnya (literally \\"New World\\"). Hocabey was a sanjak centre of Silistre Province.  Russian conquest of Sanjak of √ñzi (Ochacov Oblast)  Russian and Cossack troops take the fortress of Khadjibey, defeating the Ottomans and thus providing the impetus to found Odessa.

Gebethner, p.41 (in Polish) During the Russian-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1792, on 25 September 1789, a detachment of the Russian forces, including Zaporozhian Cossacks under Alexander Suvorov and Ivan Gudovich, took Khadjibey and Yeni D√ºnya for the Russian Empire. One section of the troops came under command of a Spaniard in Russian service, Major General Jos√© de Ribas (known in Russia as Osip Mikhailovich Deribas); today, the main street in Odessa, Deribasivska Street, is named after him. Russia formally gained possession of the Sanjak of √ñzi (Ochacov Oblast) as a result of the Treaty of Jassy (Ia≈üi) in 1792 and it became a part of Yekaterinoslav Viceroyalty. The newly acquired Ochakov Oblast was promised to the Cossacks by the Russian government for resettlement.Yefimenko, Aleksandra. Ochakov Oblast. History of Ukraine and its people. Litres. 2018 On permission of the Archbishop of Yekaterinoslav Amvrosiy, the Black Sea Kosh Host, that was located around the area between Bender and Ochakiv, built second after Sucleia wooden church of Saint Nicholas. By the Highest rescript of 17 June 1792 addressed to General Kakhovsky it was ordered to establish the Dniester Border Line of fortresses. The commander of the land forces in Ochakiv Oblast was appointed Graf (Count) Suvorov-Rymnikskiy. The main fortress was built near Sucleia at the mouth of river Botna as the Head Dniester Fortress by Engineer-Major de Wollant. Near the new fortress saw the formation of a new \\"Vorstadt\\" (suburb) where people moved from Sucleia and Parkan. With the establishment of the Voznesensk Governorate on 27 January 1795, the Vorstadt was named Tiraspol. The city of Odessa, founded by the Russian Empress Catherine the Great, centers on the site of the Turkish fortress Khadzhibei, which was occupied by a Russian Army in 1789. The Flemish engineer working for the empress, Franz de Volan (Fran√ßois Sainte de Wollant) recommended the area of Khadzhibei fortress as the site for the region's basic port: it had an ice-free harbor, breakwaters could be cheaply constructed that would render the harbor safe and it would have the capacity to accommodate large fleets. The Namestnik of Yekaterinoslav and Voznesensk, Platon Zubov (one of Catherine's favorites) supported this proposal, and in 1794 Catherine approved the founding of the new port-city and invested the first money in constructing the city. Ivan Martos's statue of the Duc de Richelieu in Odessa However, adjacent to the new official locality, a Moldavian colony already existed, which by the end of the 18th century was an independent settlement named Moldavanka. Some local historians consider that the settlement predates Odessa by about thirty years and assert that the locality was founded by Moldavians who came to build the fortress of Yeni Dunia for the Ottomans and eventually settled in the area in the late 1760s, right next to the settlement of Khadjibey (since 1795 Odessa proper), on what later became the Primorsky Boulevard. Another version posits that the settlement appeared after Odessa itself was founded, as a settlement of Moldavians, Greeks and Albanians fleeing the Ottoman yoke.Richardson, p. 110. Renaming of the settlement and establishment of sea port In 1795 Khadjibey was officially renamed as Odessa after a Greek colony of Odessos that supposedly was located in the area.Petro Tronko.

In reality it was located at the mouth of Tylihul Estuary (liman). The first census that was conducted in Odessa was in 1797 which accounted for 3,455 people. Since 1795, the city had its own city magistrate, and since 1796 a city council of six members and the Odessa Commodity Exchange. In 1801 in Odessa had opened the first commercial bank. In 1803 the city accounted for 9,000 people. In their settlement, also known as Novaya Slobodka, the Moldavians owned relatively small plots on which they built village-style houses and cultivated vineyards and gardens. What became Mykhailovsky Square was the center of this settlement and the site of its first Orthodox church, the Church of the Dormition, built in 1821 close to the seashore, as well as of a cemetery. Nearby stood the military barracks and the country houses (dacha) of the city's wealthy residents, including that of the Duc de Richelieu, appointed by Tzar Alexander I as Governor of Odessa in 1803. Richelieu played a role during Ottoman plague epidemic which hit Odessa in the autumn 1812.Travels in Russia, and a residence at St. Petersburg and Odessa, by Edward MortonOdessa, 1812: Plague and Tyranny at the Edge of the Empire Dismissive of any attempt to forge a compromise between quarantine requirements and free trade, Prince Kuriakin (the Saint Petersburg-based High Commissioner for Sanitation) countermanded Richelieu's orders.Migration and Disease in the Black Sea Region by Andrew Robarts, p. 148 In the mid-19th century Odessa became a resort town famed for its popularity among the Russian upper classes. This popularity prompted a new age of investment in the building of hotels and leisure projects. In the period from 1795 to 1814 the population of Odessa increased 15 times over and reached almost 20 thousand people. The first city plan was designed by the engineer F. Devollan in the late 18th century. Colonists of various ethnicities settled mainly in the area of the former colony, outside of the official boundaries, and as a consequence, in the first third of the 19th century, Moldavanka emerged as the dominant settlement. After planning by the official architects who designed buildings in Odessa's central district, such as the Italians Francesco Carlo Boffo and Giovanni Torricelli, Moldovanka was included in the general city plan, though the original grid-like plan of Moldovankan streets, lanes and squares remained unchanged. The new city quickly became a major success although initially it received little state funding and privileges.Odesa: Through Cossacks, Khans and Russian Emperors, The Ukrainian Week (18 November 2014) Its early growth owed much to the work of the Duc de Richelieu, who served as the city's governor between 1803 and 1814. Having fled the French Revolution, he had served in Catherine's army against the Turks. He is credited with designing the city and organizing its amenities and infrastructure, and is considered one of the founding fathers of Odessa, together with another Frenchman, Count Andrault de Langeron, who succeeded him in office. Richelieu is commemorated by a bronze statue, unveiled in 1828 to a design by Ivan Martos. His contributions to the city are mentioned by Mark Twain in his travelogue Innocents Abroad: \\"I mention this statue and this stairway because they have their story. Richelieu founded Odessa ‚Äì watched over it with paternal care ‚Äì labored with a fertile brain and a wise understanding for its best interests ‚Äì spent his fortune freely to the same end ‚Äì endowed it with a sound prosperity, and one which will yet make it one of the great cities of the Old World\\". By the early 1900s Odessa had become a large, thriving city, complete with European architecture and electrified urban transport. In 1819, the city became a free port, a status it retained until 1859. It became home to an extremely diverse population of Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Bulgarians, Crimean Tatars, Frenchmen, Germans (including Mennonites), Greeks, Italians, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Turks, Ukrainians, and traders representing many other nationalities (hence numerous \\"ethnic\\" names on the city's map, for example Frantsuzky (French) and Italiansky (Italian) Boulevards, Grecheskaya (Greek), Yevreyskaya (Jewish), Arnautskaya (Albanian) Streets). Its cosmopolitan nature was documented by the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, who lived in internal exile in Odessa between 1823 and 1824. In his letters he wrote that Odessa was a city where \\"the air is filled with all Europe, French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read\\". Odessa's growth was interrupted by the Crimean War of 1853‚Äì1856, during which it was bombarded by British and Imperial French naval forces.Clive Pointing, The Crimean War: The Truth Behind the Myth, Chatto & Windus, London, 2004, . It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odessa Russia's largest grain-exporting port. In 1866, the city was linked by rail with Kyiv and Kharkiv as well as with Ia≈üi in Romania. The 142-metre-long Potemkin Stairs (constructed 1837‚Äì1841) The city became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century, and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37% of the population. The community, however, was repeatedly subjected to anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish agitation from almost all Christian segments of the population. Pogroms were carried out in 1821, 1859, 1871, 1881 and 1905. Many Odessan Jews fled abroad after 1882, particularly to the Ottoman region that became Palestine, and the city became an important base of support for Zionism.  Beginnings of revolution  Bolshevik troops entering Odessa In 1905, Odessa was the site of a workers' uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin and the Menshevik's Iskra. Sergei Eisenstein's famous motion picture The Battleship Potemkin commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odessan citizens were murdered on the great stone staircase (now popularly known as the \\"Potemkin Steps\\"), in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history. At the top of the steps, which lead down to the port, stands a statue of the Duc de Richelieu. The actual massacre took place in streets nearby, not on the steps themselves, but the film caused many to visit Odessa to see the site of the \\"slaughter\\". The \\"Odessa Steps\\" continue to be a tourist attraction in Odessa. The film was made at Odessa's Cinema Factory, one of the oldest cinema studios in the former Soviet Union. Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 during Ukrainian-Soviet War, Odessa saw two Bolshevik armed insurgencies, the second of which succeeded in establishing their control over the city; for the following months the city became a center of the Odessa Soviet Republic. After signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty all Bolshevik forces were driven out by 13 March 1918 by the combined armed forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army, providing support to the Ukrainian People's Republic. With the end of the World War I and withdrawal of armies of Central Powers, the Soviet forces fought for control over the country with the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic. A few months later the city was occupied by the French Army and the Greek Army that supported the Russian White Army in its struggle with the Bolsheviks. The Ukrainian general Nikifor Grigoriev who sided with Bolsheviks managed to drive the unwelcome Triple Entente forces out of the city, but Odessa was soon retaken by the Russian White Army. Finally, by 1920 the Soviet Red Army managed to overpower both Ukrainian and Russian White Army and secure the city. The people of Odessa suffered badly from a famine that resulted from the Russian Civil War in 1921‚Äì1922 due to the Soviet policies of prodrazverstka.

The defense of Odessa lasted 73 days from 5 August to 16 October 1941. The defense was organized on three lines with emplacements consisting of trenches, anti-tank ditches and pillboxes. The first line was long and situated some from the city. The second and main line of defense was situated from the city and was about long. The third and last line of defense was organized inside the city itself. A medal, \\"For the Defence of Odessa\\", was established on 22 December 1942. Approximately 38,000 medals were awarded to servicemen of the Soviet Army, Navy, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and civil citizens who took part in the city's defense. It was one of the first four Soviet cities to be awarded the title of \\"Hero City\\" in 1945. (These others were Leningrad, Stalingrad, and Sevastopol). Lyudmila Pavlichenko, the famous female sniper, took part in the battle for Odessa. Her first two kills were effected near Belyayevka using a Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle with a P.E. 4-power scope. She recorded 187 confirmed kills during the defense of Odessa. Pavlichenko's confirmed kills during World War II totaled 309 (including 36 enemy snipers). Before being occupied by Romanian troops in 1941, a part of the city's population, industry, infrastructure and all cultural valuables possible were evacuated to inner regions of the USSR and the retreating Red Army units destroyed as much as they could of Odessa's remaining harbour facilities. The city was land mined in the same way as Kyiv. During World War II, from 1941‚Äì1944, Odessa was subject to Romanian administration, as the city had been made part of Transnistria. Partisan fighting continued, however, in the city's catacombs. Soviet gun crew in action at Odessa in 1941 Following the Siege of Odessa, and the Axis occupation, approximately 25,000 Odessans were murdered in the outskirts of the city and over 35,000 deported; this came to be known as the Odessa massacre. Most of the atrocities were committed during the first six months of the occupation which officially began on 17 October 1941, when 80% of the 210,000 Jews in the region were killed,Richardson, p. 33. compared to Jews in Romania proper where the majority survived. After the Nazi forces began to lose ground on the Eastern Front, the Romanian administration changed its policy, refusing to deport the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in German occupied Poland, and allowing Jews to work as hired labourers. As a result, despite the events of 1941, the survival of the Jewish population in this area was higher than in other areas of occupied eastern Europe. The city suffered severe damage and sustained many casualties over the course of the war. Many parts of Odessa were damaged during both its siege and recapture on 10 April 1944, when the city was finally liberated by the Red Army. Some of the Odessans had a more favourable view of the Romanian occupation, in contrast with the Soviet official view that the period was exclusively a time of hardship, deprivation, oppression and suffering ‚Äì claims embodied in public monuments and disseminated through the media to this day.Richardson, p. 103. Subsequent Soviet policies imprisoned and executed numerous Odessans (and deported most of the German population) on account of collaboration with the occupiers.Richardson, p. 17.

Postwar history  Ships at anchor in Odessa ‚Äì the USSR's largest port, 1960 During the 1960s and 1970s, the city grew. Nevertheless, the majority of Odessa's Jews emigrated to Israel, the United States and other Western countries between the 1970s and 1990s. Many ended up in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach, sometimes known as \\"Little Odessa\\". Domestic migration of the Odessan middle and upper classes to Moscow and Leningrad, cities that offered even greater opportunities for career advancement, also occurred on a large scale. Despite this, the city grew rapidly by filling the void of those left with new migrants from rural Ukraine and industrial professionals invited from all over the Soviet Union. Nowadays the city is undergoing a phase of widespread urban restoration: Russov House in 2020 As a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the city preserved and somewhat reinforced its unique cosmopolitan mix of Russian/Ukrainian/Jewish culture and a predominantly Russophone environment with the uniquely accented dialect of Russian spoken in the city. The city's unique identity has been formed largely thanks to its varied demography; all the city's communities have influenced aspects of Odessan life in some way or form. Odessa is a city of more than 1 million people. The city's industries include shipbuilding, oil refining, chemicals, metalworking, and food processing. Odessa is also a Ukrainian naval base and home to a fishing fleet. It is known for its large outdoor market ‚Äì the Seventh-Kilometer Market, the largest of its kind in Europe. The city has seen violence in the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine during 2014 Odessa clashes. The 2 May 2014 Odessa clashes between pro- Ukrainian and pro-Russian protestors killed 42 people. Four were killed during the protests, and at least 32 trade unionists were killed after a trade union building was set on fire after Molotov cocktails exchange between sides. Polls conducted from September to December 2014 found no support for joining Russia. Odessa was struck by three bomb blasts in December 2014, one of which killed one person (the injuries sustained by the victim indicated that he had dealt with explosives).Two dead after Ukraine rocked by series of blasts, Mashable (28 December 2014) Interior minister's advisor says Kharkiv, Odesa explosions aim at escalating tensions in Ukraine, Interfax-Ukraine (25 December 2014)Bomb Explosion in Odessa Could Have Targeted Ukraine Army Charity Point, The Moscow Times (10 December 2014) Southern Ukraine: Blasts in Kherson, Odessa, Rt tv (27 December 2014) Internal Affairs Ministry advisor Zorian Shkiryak said on 25 December that Odessa and Kharkiv had become \\"cities which are being used to escalate tensions\\" in Ukraine.

On 5 January 2015 the city's Euromaidan Coordination Center and a cargo train car were (non-lethally) bombed.French Leader Urges End to Sanctions Against Russia Over Ukraine, New York Times (5 January 2015) Latest Explosion in Odessa Strikes Pro-Ukraine Organization (Video), The Moscow Times (5 January 2015) Mysterious bombing rocks Ukrainian port city of Odessa, Mashable (5 January 2015)  Geography   Location  The Vorontsov Lighthouse in the Gulf of Odessa. The city is located on the Black Sea. Odessa is situated () on terraced hills overlooking a small harbor on the Black Sea in the Gulf of Odessa, approximately north of the estuary of the Dniester river and some south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. The average elevation at which the city is located is around , while the maximum is and minimum (on the coast) amounts to above sea level. The city currently covers a territory of , the population density for which is around 6,139 persons/km¬≤. Sources of running water in the city include the Dniester River, from which water is taken and then purified at a processing plant just outside the city. Being located in the south of Ukraine, the topography of the area surrounding the city is typically flat and there are no large mountains or hills for many kilometres around. Flora is of the deciduous variety and Odessa is known for its tree-lined avenues which, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, made the city a favourite year-round retreat for the Russian aristocracy. The city's location on the coast of the Black Sea has also helped to create a booming tourist industry in Odessa. The city's Arkadia beach has long been a favourite place for relaxation, both for the city's inhabitants and its visitors. This is a large sandy beach which is located to the south of the city centre. Odessa's many sandy beaches are considered to be quite unique in Ukraine, as the country's southern coast (particularly in the Crimea) tends to be a location in which the formation of stoney and pebble beaches has proliferated. The coastal cliffs adjacent to the city are home to frequent landslides, resulting in a typical change of landscape along the Black Sea. Due to the fluctuating slopes of land, city planners are responsible for monitoring the stability of such areas, and for preserving potentially threatened building and other structures of the city above sea level near water. Also a potential danger to the infrastructure and architecture of the city is the presence of multiple openings underground. These cavities can cause buildings to collapse, resulting in a loss of money and business. Due to the effects of climate and weather on sedimentary rocks beneath the city, the result is instability under some buildings' foundations.  Climate  Odessa has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Dfa, using the isotherm) that borderlines the semi-arid climate (BSk) as well as a humid subtropical climate (Cfa) This has, over the past few centuries, aided the city greatly in creating conditions necessary for the development of summer tourism. During the tsarist era, Odessa's climate was considered to be beneficial for the body, and thus many wealthy but sickly persons were sent to the city in order to relax and recuperate. This resulted in the development of spa culture and the establishment of a number of high-end hotels in the city. The average annual temperature of sea is , whilst seasonal temperatures range from an average of in the period from January to March, to in August. Typically, for a total of 4 months ‚Äì from June to September ‚Äì the average sea temperature in the Gulf of Odessa and city's bay area exceeds . The city typically experiences dry, cold winters, which are relatively mild when compared to most of Ukraine as they're marked by temperatures which rarely fall below . Summers on the other hand do see an increased level of precipitation, and the city often experiences warm weather with temperatures often reaching into the high 20s and low 30s. Snow cover is often light or moderate, and municipal services rarely experience the same problems that can often be found in other, more northern, Ukrainian cities. This is largely because the higher winter temperatures and coastal location of Odessa prevent significant snowfall. Additionally the city hardly ever faces the phenomenon of sea-freezing.  Demographics  According to the 2001 census, Ukrainians make up a majority (62 percent) of Odessa's inhabitants, along with an ethnic Russian minority (29 percent). Historical population A 2015 study by the International Republican Institute found that 68% of Odessa was ethnic Ukrainian, and 25% ethnic Russian. Despite Odessa's Ukrainian majority, Russian is the dominant language in the city. In 2015, the main language spoken at home was Russian ‚àí around 78% of the total population ‚àí followed by Ukrainian at 6%, and an equal combination of Ukrainian and Russian, 15%. Odessa oblast is also home to a number of other nationalities and minority ethnic groups, including Albanians, Armenians, Azeris, Crimean Tatars, Bulgarians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Poles, Romanians, Turks, among others. Up until the early 1940s the city had a large Jewish population. As the result of mass deportation to extermination camps during the Second World War, the city's Jewish population declined considerably. Since the 1970s, the majority of the remaining Jewish population emigrated to Israel and other countries, shrinking the Jewish community. Through most of the 19th century and until the mid 20th century, the largest ethnic group in Odessa was Russians, with the second largest ethnic group being Jews.Dnistryansky, –ú.S.

However, since Odessa is a city of regional significance, this makes the city subject directly to the administration of the oblast's authorities, thus removing it from the responsibility of the municipality. The city of Odessa is governed by a mayor and city council which work cooperatively to ensure the smooth-running of the city and procure its municipal bylaws. The city's budget is also controlled by the administration. The mayoralty plays the role of the executive in the city's municipal administration. Above all comes the mayor, who is elected, by the city's electorate, for five years in a direct election. 2015 Mayoral election of Odessa Gennadiy Trukhanov was reelected in the first round of the election with 52,9% of the vote. There are five deputy mayors, each of which is responsible for a certain particular part of the city's public policy. An old map of Odessa's city centre. North is to the left. The City Council of the city makes up the administration's legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city 'parliament' or rada. The municipal council is made up of 120 elected members, who are each elected to represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. The current council is the fifth in the city's modern history, and was elected in January 2011. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city's budget is drawn up. The council has seventeen standing commissions which play an important role in controlling the finances and trading practices of the city and its merchants. The territory of Odessa is divided into four administrative raions (districts): * Kyivsky Raion * Malynovsky Raion * Prymorsky Raion * Suvorovsky Raion In addition, every raion has its own administration, subordinate to the Odessa City council, and with limited responsibilities.  Cityscape  Many of Odessa's buildings have, rather uniquely for a Ukrainian city, been influenced by the Mediterranean style of classical architecture. This is particularly noticeable in buildings built by architects such as the Italian Francesco Boffo, who in early 19th-century built a palace and colonnade for the Governor of Odessa, Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, the Potocki Palace and many other public buildings. Italian baroque facade of the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater. In 1887 one of the city's most well known architectural monuments was completed ‚Äì the theatre, which still hosts a range of performances to this day; it is widely regarded as one of the world's finest opera houses. The first opera house was opened in 1810 and destroyed by fire in 1873. The modern building was constructed by Fellner and Helmer in neo-baroque; its luxurious hall was built in the rococo style. It is said that thanks to its unique acoustics even a whisper from the stage can be heard in any part of the hall. The theatre was projected along the lines of Dresden's Semperoper built in 1878, with its nontraditional foyer following the curvatures of the auditorium; the building's most recent renovation was completed in 2007.Buildings for Music, Michael Forsythe, Cambridge University Press, p. 344 The centre of Odessa, with its statue of Catherine the Great, is one of the city's central landmarks. Odessa's most iconic symbol, the Potemkin Stairs, is a vast staircase that conjures an illusion so that those at the top only see a series of large steps, while at the bottom all the steps appear to merge into one pyramid-shaped mass. The original 200 steps (now reduced to 192) were designed by Italian architect Francesco Boffo and built between 1837 and 1841. The steps were made famous by Sergei Eisenstein in his film, Battleship Potemkin. Most of the city's 19th- century houses were built of limestone mined nearby. Abandoned mines were later used and broadened by local smugglers. This created a gigantic complicated labyrinth of tunnels beneath Odessa, known as \\"Odessa Catacombs\\". During World War II, the catacombs served as a hiding place for partisans and natural shelter for civilians, who were escaping air plane bombing. The Londonskaya Hotel, on Odessa's magnificent Primorsky Bulvar, is one of the city's landmark buildings. Deribasivska Street, an attractive pedestrian avenue named after Jos√© de Ribas, the Spanish-born founder of Odessa and decorated Russian Navy Admiral from the Russo-Turkish War, is famous by its unique character and architecture. During the summer it is common to find large crowds of people leisurely sitting and talking on the outdoor terraces of numerous caf√©s, bars and restaurants, or simply enjoying a walk along the cobblestone street, which is not open to vehicular traffic and is kept shaded by the linden trees which line its route. A similar streetscape can also be found in that of Primorsky Bulvar, a grand thoroughfare which runs along the edge of the plateau upon which the city is situated, and where many of the city's most imposing buildings are to be found. As one of the biggest on the Black Sea, Odessa's port is busy all year round. The Odessa Sea Port is located on an artificial stretch of Black Sea coast, along with the north- western part of the Gulf of Odessa. The total shoreline length of Odessa's sea port is around . The port, which includes an oil refinery, container handling facility, passenger area and numerous areas for handling dry cargo, is lucky in that its work does not depend on seasonal weather; the harbour itself is defended from the elements by breakwaters. The port is able to handle up to 14 million tons of cargo and about 24 million tons of oil products annually, whilst its passenger terminals can cater for around 4 million passengers a year at full capacity.  Parks and gardens  The city's Preobrazhensky Park surrounds its cathedral. Schevchenko Park Park zone at Primorskiy prospekt in Odessa There are a number of public parks and gardens in Odessa, among these are the Preobrazhensky, Gorky and Victory parks, the latter of which is an arboretum. The city is also home to a university botanical garden, which recently celebrated its 200th anniversary, and a number of other smaller gardens. The City Garden, or Gorodskoy Sad, is perhaps the most famous of Odessa's gardens. Laid out in 1803 by Felix De Ribas (brother of the founder of Odessa, Jos√© de Ribas) on a plot of urban land he owned, the garden is located right in the heart of the city. When Felix decided that he was no longer able to provide enough money for the garden's upkeep, he decided to present it to the people of Odessa. The transfer of ownership took place on 10 November 1806. Nowadays the garden is home to a bandstand and is the traditional location for outdoor theater in the summertime. Numerous sculptures can also be found within the grounds as well as a musical fountain, the waters of which are computer controlled to coordinate with the musical melody being played. Odessa's largest park, Shevchenko Park (previously Alexander Park), was founded in 1875, during a visit to the city by Emperor Alexander II. The park covers an area of around and is located near the centre of the city, on the side closest to the sea. Within the park there are a variety of cultural and entertainment facilities, and wide pedestrian avenues. In the center of the park is the local top-flight football team's Chornomorets Stadium, the Alexander Column and municipal observatory. The Baryatinsky Bulvar is popular for its route, which starts at the park's gate before winding its way along the edge of the coastal plateau. There are a number of monuments and memorials in the park, one of which is dedicated to the park's namesake, the Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko.  Education  The Odessa National Scientific Library is a major research library, and centre for study, in southern Ukraine. Odessa is home to several universities and other institutions of higher education. The city's best-known and most prestigious university is the Odessa 'I.I. Mechnikov' National University. This university is the oldest in the city and was first founded by an edict of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1865 as the Imperial Novorossian University. Since then the university has developed to become one of modern Ukraine's leading research and teaching universities, with staff of around 1,800 and total of thirteen academic faculties. Other than the National University, the city is also home to the 1921-inaugurated Odessa National Economic University, the Odessa National Medical University (founded 1900), the 1918-founded Odessa National Polytechnic University and the Odessa National Maritime University (established 1930). The main building of the Odessa National Medical University. In addition to these universities, the city is home to the Odessa Law Academy, the National Academy of Telecommunications and the Odessa National Maritime Academy. The last of these institutions is a highly specialised and prestigious establishment for the preparation and training of merchant mariners which sees around 1,000 newly qualified officer cadets graduate each year and take up employment in the merchant marines of numerous countries around the world. The South Ukrainian National Pedagogical University is also based in the city, this is one of the largest institutions for the preparation of educational specialists in Ukraine and is recognised as one of the country's finest of such universities. In addition to all the state-run universities mentioned above, Odessa is also home to many private educational institutes and academies which offer highly specified courses in a range of different subjects. These establishments, however, typically charge much higher fees than government-owned establishments and may not have held the same level of official accreditation as their state-run peers. With regard to primary and secondary education, Odessa has many schools catering for all ages from kindergarten through to lyceum (final secondary school level) age. Most of these schools are state-owned and operated, and all schools have to be state-accredited in order to teach children.  Culture   Museums, art and music  Neoclassical style just like many other landmarks of the city.

Among the city's public sculptures, two sets of Medici lions can be noted, at the Vorontsov Palace:Commons:Medici lions at Vorontsov palace in Odessa as well as the Starosinnyi Garden.:Commons:File:Starosinnyi Garden.JPG Jacob Adler, the major star of the Yiddish theatre in New York and father of the actor, director and teacher Stella Adler, was born and spent his youth in Odessa. The most popular Russian show business people from Odessa are Yakov Smirnoff (comedian), Mikhail Zhvanetsky (legendary humorist writer, who began his career as a port engineer) and Roman Kartsev (comedian ). Zhvanetsky's and Kartsev's success in the 1970s, along with Odessa's KVN team, contributed to Odessa's established status as \\"capital of Soviet humor\\", culminating in the annual Humoryna festival, carried out around the beginning of April. Odessa was also the home of the late Armenian painter Sarkis Ordyan (1918‚Äì2003), the Ukrainian painter Mickola Vorokhta and the Greek philologist, author and promoter of Demotic Greek Ioannis Psycharis (1854‚Äì1929).

(Note: Richter studied in Odessa but wasn't born there.) The Odessa International Film Festival is also held in this city annually since 2010.  Literature  The School of Stolyarsky, founded in 1933, has long been recognised as a centre of musical excellence. Poet Anna Akhmatova was born in Bolshoy Fontan near Odessa, however her further work was not connected with the city and its literary tradition. The city has produced many writers, including Isaac Babel, whose series of short stories, Odessa Tales, are set in the city. Other Odessites are the duo Ilf and Petrov - authors of \\"The Twelve chairs\\", and Yuri Olesha - author of \\"The Three Fat Men\\". Vera Inber, a poet and writer, as well as the poet and journalist, Margarita Aliger were both born in Odessa. The Italian writer, slavist and anti-fascist dissident Leone Ginzburg was born in Odessa into a Jewish family, and then went to Italy where he grew up and lived. One of the most prominent pre-war Soviet writers, Valentin Kataev, was born here and began his writing career as early as high school (gymnasia). Before moving to Moscow in 1922, he made quite a few acquaintances here, including Yury Olesha and Ilya Ilf (Ilf's co-author Petrov was in fact Kataev's brother, Petrov being his pen-name). Kataev became a benefactor for these young authors, who would become some of the most talented and popular Russian writers of this period. In 1955 Kataev became the first chief editor of the Youth (), one of the leading literature magazines of the Ottepel of the 1950s and 1960s. These authors and comedians played a great role in establishing the \\"Odessa myth\\" in the Soviet Union. Odessites were and are viewed in the ethnic stereotype as sharp-witted, street-wise and eternally optimistic. These qualities are reflected in the \\"Odessa dialect\\", which borrows chiefly from the characteristic speech of the Odessan Jews, and is enriched by a plethora of influences common for the port city. The \\"Odessite speech\\" became a staple of the \\"Soviet Jew\\" depicted in a multitude of jokes and comedy acts, in which a Jewish adherent served as a wise and subtle dissenter and opportunist, always pursuing his own well-being, but unwittingly pointing out the flaws and absurdities of the Soviet regime. The Odessan Jew in the jokes always \\"came out clean\\" and was, in the end, a lovable character ‚Äì unlike some of other jocular nation stereotypes such as The Chukcha, The Ukrainian, The Estonian or The American.

Sponsored by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, it was signed by President Herbert Hoover on June 17, 1930. The act raised US tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods.Taussig (1931) The tariffs under the act, excluding duty-free imports (see Tariff levels below), were the second highest in United States history, exceeded by only the Tariff of 1828.WWS 543: Class notes, 2/17/10, Paul Krugman, February 16, 2010, Presentation, slide 4 The Act and tariffs imposed by America's trading partners in retaliation were major factors of the reduction of American exports and imports by 67% during the Depression.Alfred E. Eckes, Jr., Opening America's Market: U.S. Foreign Trade Policy Since 1776 (University of North Carolina Press, 1995, pp. 100‚Äì03) Economists and economic historians have a consensus view that the passage of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff worsened the effects of the Great Depression. Sponsors and legislative history Willis C. Hawley (left) and Reed Smoot in April 1929, shortly before the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act passed the House of Representatives. In 1922, Congress passed the Fordney‚ÄìMcCumber Tariff Act, which increased tariffs on imports. The League of Nations' World Economic Conference met at Geneva in 1927, concluding in its final report: \\"the time has come to put an end to tariffs, and to move in the opposite direction.\\" Vast debts and reparations could be repaid only through gold, services, or goods, but the only items available on that scale were goods. However, many of the delegates' governments did the opposite; in 1928, France was the first by passing a new tariff law and quota system.The War: the root and remedy, George Peel, 1941 By the late 1920s, the US economy had made exceptional gains in productivity because of electrification, which was a critical factor in mass production. Also, horses and mules had been replaced by motorcars, trucks, and tractors. One sixth to one quarter of farmland, which had been devoted to feeding horses and mules, was freed up, contributing to a surplus in farm produce. Although nominal and real wages had increased, they did not keep up with the productivity gains. As a result, the ability to produce exceeded market demand, a condition that was variously termed overproduction and underconsumption. Senator Smoot contended that raising the tariff on imports would alleviate the overproduction problem, but the United States had actually been running a trade account surplus, and although manufactured goods imports were rising, manufactured exports were rising even faster. Food exports had been falling and were in trade account deficit, but the value of food imports were a little over half of the value of manufactured imports. As the global economy entered the first stages of the Great Depression in late 1929, the main goal of the US was to protect its jobs and farmers from foreign competition. Smoot championed another tariff increase within the United States in 1929, which became the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Bill. In his memoirs, Smoot made it abundantly clear: > The world is paying for its ruthless destruction of life and property in the > World War and for its failure to adjust purchasing power to productive > capacity during the industrial revolution of the decade following the war.. Smoot was a Republican from Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Willis C. Hawley, a Republican from Oregon, was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. During the 1928 presidential election, one of Herbert Hoover's promises was to help beleaguered farmers by increasing tariffs on agricultural products. Hoover won, and Republicans maintained comfortable majorities in the House and the Senate during 1928. Hoover then asked Congress for an increase of tariff rates for agricultural goods and a decrease of rates for industrial goods. thumbSenate vote by state The House passed a version of the act in May 1929, increasing tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods alike. The House bill passed on a vote of 264 to 147, with 244 Republicans and 20 Democrats voting in favor of the bill. The Senate debated its bill until March 1930, with many members trading votes based on their states' industries. The Senate bill passed on a vote of 44 to 42, with 39 Republicans and 5 Democrats voting in favor of the bill. The conference committee then unified the two versions, largely by raising tariffs to the higher levels passed by the House.. The House passed the conference bill on a vote of 222 to 153, with the support of 208 Republicans and 14 Democrats. Opponents In May 1930, a petition was signed by 1,028 economists in the United States asking President Hoover to veto the legislation, organized by Paul Douglas, Irving Fisher, James T.F.G. Wood, Frank Graham, Ernest Patterson, Henry Seager, Frank Taussig, and Clair Wilcox... Automobile executive Henry Ford also spent an evening at the White House trying to convince Hoover to veto the bill, calling it \\"an economic stupidity\\",. while J. P. Morgan's Chief Executive Thomas W. Lamont said he \\"almost went down on [his] knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley‚ÄìSmoot tariff\\".. While Hoover joined the economists in opposing the bill, calling it \\"vicious, extortionate, and obnoxious\\" because he felt it would undermine the commitment he had pledged to international cooperation, he eventually signed the bill after he yielded to influence from his own party, his Cabinet (who had threatened to resign), and business leaders.. Hoover's fears were well founded, as Canada and other countries raised their own tariffs in retaliation after the bill had become law. Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke against the act during his campaign for President in 1932. Retaliation Threats of retaliation by other countries began long before the bill was enacted into law in June 1930. As the House of Representatives passed it in May 1929, boycotts broke out, and foreign governments moved to increase rates against American products, although rates could be increased or decreased by the Senate or by the conference committee. By September 1929, Hoover's administration had received protest notes from 23 trading partners, but the threats of retaliatory actions were ignored. In May 1930, Canada, the country's most loyal trading partner, retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of US exports to Canada.. Canada later also forged closer economic links with the British Empire via the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932, while France and Britain protested and developed new trade partners, and Germany developed a system of trade via clearing. The depression worsened for workers and farmers despite Smoot and Hawley's promises of prosperity from high tariffs; consequently, Hawley lost re-nomination, while Smoot was one of 12 Republican Senators who lost their seats in the 1932 elections, with the swing being the largest in Senate history (being equalled in 1958 and 1980). Tariff levels Average Tariff Rates in USA (1821‚Äì2016) In the two-volume series published by the US Bureau of the Census, \\"The Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition\\", tariff rates have been represented in two forms. The dutiable tariff rate peak of 1932 was 59.1%, second only to the 61.7% rate of 1830. However, 63% of all imports in 1933 were not taxed, which the dutiable tariff rate does not reflect. The free and dutiable rate in 1929 was 13.5%, and peaked under Smoot‚ÄìHawley in 1933 at 19.8%, one-third below the average 29.7% \\"free and dutiable rate\\" in the United States from 1821 to 1900. Table: Series U207-212 (Part 2 ZIP file: file named CT1970p2-08.pdf). The average tariff rate on dutiable importshttps://www.usitc.gov/documents/dataweb/ave_table_1891_2016.pdf increased from 40.1% in 1929 to 59.1% in 1932 (+19%). However, it had already been consistently at high levels between 1865 and 1913 (from 38% to 52%), and it had also risen sharply in 1861 (from 18.61% to 36.2%; +17.59%), between 1863 and 1866 (from 32.62% to 48.33%; +15.71%), and between 1920 and 1922 (from 16.4% to 38.1%; +21.7%) without producing global depressions. After enactment At first, the tariff seemed to be a success. According to historian Robert Sobel, \\"Factory payrolls, construction contracts, and industrial production all increased sharply.\\" However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff became apparent. US imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. GNP fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933.Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics series F-1 Imports from Europe decreased from a 1929 high of $1.3 billion to just $390 million during 1932, and US exports to Europe decreased from $2.3 billion in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade decreased by some 66% between 1929 and 1934.. Using panel data estimates of export and import equations for 17 countries, Jakob B. Madsen (2002) estimated the effects of increasing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers on worldwide trade from 1929 to 1932. He concluded that real international trade contracted somewhere around 33% overall. His estimates of the impact of various factors included about 14% because of declining GNP in each country, 8% because of increases in tariff rates, 5% because of deflation-induced tariff increases, and 6% because of the imposition of non-tariff barriers. The new tariff imposed an effective tax rate of 60% on more than 3,200 products and materials imported into the United States, quadrupling previous tariff rates on individual items but raising the average tariff rate to 19.2%, which was in line with average rates of that day. Unemployment was 8% in 1930 when the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Act was passed, but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931 and 25% in 1932‚Äì1933.. There is some contention about whether this can necessarily be attributed to the tariff, however.Eckes, p. 113Douglas A. Irwin, \\"The Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff: A Quantitative Assessment\\", The Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 80, No.2, The MIT Press, May 1998, pp. 332‚Äì33. It was only during World War II, when \\"the American economy expanded at an unprecedented rate\\",Tassava, Christopher. \\"The American Economy during World War II\\". EH.Net Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Whaples. February 10, 2008. that unemployment fell below 1930s levels.Bureau of Labor Statistics, \\"Graph of U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1930‚Äì1945\\", HERB: Resources for Teachers, retrieved April 24, 2015. Imports during 1929 were only 4.2% of the US GNP, and exports were only 5.0%. Monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, who emphasize the central role of the money supply in causing the depression, consider the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Act to be only a minor cause for the US Great Depression.Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz, A monetary history of the United States, 1867‚Äì1960 (1963) p. 342 End of tariffs The 1932 Democratic campaign platform pledged to lower tariffs. After winning the election, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the now-Democratic Congress passed Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This act allowed the President to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis and treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring a majority, rather than as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade negotiating framework that developed after World War II. The tit-for-tat responses of other countries were understood to have contributed to a sharp reduction of trade in the 1930s. After World War II, that understanding supported a push towards multilateral trading agreements that would prevent similar situations in the future. While the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 focused on foreign exchange and did not directly address tariffs, those involved wanted a similar framework for international trade. President Harry S. Truman launched this process in November 1945 with negotiations for the creation of a proposed International Trade Organization (ITO). As it happened, separate negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) moved more quickly, with an agreement signed in October 1947; in the end, the United States never signed the ITO agreement. Adding a multilateral \\"most-favored-nation\\" component to that of reciprocity, the GATT served as a framework for the gradual reduction of tariffs over the subsequent half century.. Postwar changes to the Smoot‚ÄìHawley tariffs reflected a general tendency of the United States to reduce its tariff levels unilaterally while its trading partners retained their high levels. The American Tariff League Study of 1951 compared the free and dutiable tariff rates of 43 countries. It found that only seven nations had a lower tariff level than the United States (5.1%), and eleven nations had free and dutiable tariff rates higher than the Smoot‚ÄìHawley peak of 19.8% including the United Kingdom (25.6%). The 43-country average was 14.4%, which was 0.9% higher than the U.S. level of 1929, demonstrating that few nations were reciprocating in reducing their levels as the United States reduced its own.Lloyd, Lewis E. Tariffs: The Case for Protection. The Devin- Adair Co., 1955, Appendix, Table VI, pp. 188‚Äì89 In modern political dialogue In the discussion leading up to the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) then-Vice President Al Gore mentioned the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff as a response to NAFTA objections voiced by Ross Perot during a debate in 1993 they had on The Larry King Show. He gave Perot a framed picture of Smoot and Hawley shaking hands after its passage. The act has been compared to the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), with Andrew Quinlan from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity calling FATCA \\"the worst economic idea to come out of Congress since Smoot‚ÄìHawley\\".

This was the first comprehensive amendment of U.S. general immigration laws designed to face up to the realities of modern refugee situations by stating a clear-cut national policy and providing a flexible mechanism to meet the rapidly shifting developments of today's world policy.Roberts, 1982 The main objectives of the act were to create a new definition of refugee based on the one created at the UN Convention and Protocol on the Status of Refugees, raise the limitation from 17,400 to 50,000 refugees admitted each fiscal year, provide emergency procedures for when that number exceeds 50,000, and to establish the Office of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs and the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Most importantly, it established explicit procedures on how to deal with refugees in the U.S. by creating a uniform and effective resettlement and absorption policy.Kennedy, 1981 Purpose The Act recognizes that it has been the historic policy of the United States to respond to the urgent needs of persons subject to persecution in their homelands and to provide assistance, asylum, and resettlement opportunities to admitted refugees. The goal of the Refugee Act was to create a uniform procedure with which to provide these opportunities to refugees.94 Stat. 102 Admission of Refugees The Act amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 by defining a refugee as any person who is outside his or her country of residence or nationality, or without nationality, and is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.94 Stat. 102 The annual admission of refugees is set to a 50,000 cap per fiscal year, but in an emergency situation, the President may change the number for a period of twelve months. The Attorney General is also granted power to admit additional refugees and grant asylum to current aliens, but all admissions must be reported to Congress and be limited to 5,000 people.94 Stat. 102 Summary The Act created the position of U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs who was now responsible to the president for the development of overall US refugee admission and resettlement policy. Title IV of the Immigration and Nationality Act was amended here when the Act created the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is responsible for funding and administering federal programs for domestic resettlement and assistance to refugees. The office must make available resources for employment training and placement for refugees to be economically self-sufficient, provide opportunities for English language training, ensure cash assistance, and guarantee gender equality in all training and instruction. The Office must also create grants for these projects, consult with state and local governments about sponsorship and distribution of refugees, and develop a system to monitor the use of government funds using evaluations, auditing and data collection. To receive assistance for programs, the States must first explain how they plan to accomplish the goals of these programs, meet the director's standards, and submit a report at the end of each fiscal year.94 Stat. 102 The Secretary of State was authorized to take on the role from 1980 to 1981, and the new director worked with them to develop and implement programs for existing refugees and eventually took up the position from 1982 onward. The director must submit a congressional report at the end of each fiscal year to committees on the Judiciary of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. The reports should contain information on the geographic location, employment status, and problems of the refugees and also contain suggestions for alternative resettlement strategies. The Office was authorized $200,000,000 during 1980 and 1981, and that number is now decided at the beginning of each fiscal year based on the results received at the end of each year.94 Stat. 102 History It was only after World War II that the United States began to differentiate the term \\"refugee\\" from \\"immigrant\\" and began creating policy that dealt specifically with refugees while working outside of immigration policy.Deborah E. Akner, 1981 Early action came in the form of the Displaced Persons Act of 1948, the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, and the Refugee-Escapee Act of 1957.Roberts, 1982 The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which was later amended in 1965 to include policy for refugees on a case by case basis, was the first Act that consolidated U.S. immigration policy into one body of text. The creation of the Refugee Act began with hearings by the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security from 1965 to 1968, which recommended for Congress create a uniform system for refugees, but received little support. Edward Kennedy began writing to propose a bill to reform refugee policy in 1978 and first introduced the idea to the United States Senate in 1979. With his proposal, he hoped to address the need for a reformed policy that was not specifically designed for people from communist regimes in Eastern Europe or repressive governments in the Middle East, as it was in the past. At the time, there was an average of 200,000 refugees coming to the United States, most of which were Indochinese and Soviet Jews.Kennedy, 1981 The cost of resettlement was close to $4000, but most refugees eventually paid that amount in federal income taxes. Many Americans feared a floodgate scenario with a large and sudden increase of the refugee population, but the 50,000 cap would account for only 10% of immigration flow to the U.S. and would allow one refugee for every 4000 Americans,Kennedy, 1981 small numbers compared to those of countries like Canada, France, and Australia. The bill was adopted by the Senate by a unanimous vote on September 6, 1979, and it remained essentially intact until it was signed in 1980. Notes References *Deborah E. Anker, M. H. (1981).

It is a form of regulation of foreign trade and policy that taxes foreign products to encourage or safeguard domestic industry. Traditionally, states have used them as a source of income. Nowadays, they are among the most widely used instruments of protectionism, along with import and export quotas. Tariffs can be fixed (a constant sum per unit of imported goods or a percentage of the price) or variable (the amount varies according to the price). Taxing imports means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy local products instead ‚Äì boosting the country's economy. Tariffs therefore provide an incentive to develop production and replace imports with domestic products. Tariffs are meant to reduce pressure from foreign competition and reduce the trade deficit. They have historically been justified as a means to protect infant industries and to allow import substitution industrialization. Tariffs may also be used to rectify artificially low prices for certain imported goods, due to 'dumping', export subsidies or currency manipulation. There is near unanimous consensus among economists that tariffs have a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth.See P.Krugman, ¬´The Narrow and Broad Arguments for Free Trade¬ª, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 83(3), 1993 ; and P.Krugman, Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations, New York, W.W. Norton & Company, 1994.N. Gregory Mankiw, Economists Actually Agree on This: The Wisdom of Free Trade, New York Times (April 24, 2015): \\"Economists are famous for disagreeing with one another.... But economists reach near unanimity on some topics, including international trade.\\"William Poole, Free Trade: Why Are Economists and Noneconomists So Far Apart, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October 2004, 86(5), pp. 1: \\"most observers agree that '[t]he consensus among mainstream economists on the desirability of free trade remains almost universal.'\\" However, liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses, and the economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.  Etymology  The origin of tariff is the Italian word tariffa translated as \\"list of prices, book of rates\\", which is likely derived from the Arabic ÿ™ÿπÿ±ŸäŸÅ (ta'rif) meaning \\"notification\\" or \\"inventory of fees to be paid\\".The Online Etymology Dictionary: tariff. The 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary gives the same etymology, with a reference dating to 1591.  History  Average tariff rates for selected countries (1913‚Äì2007) Tariff rates in Japan (1870‚Äì1960) Average tariff rates in Spain and Italy (1860‚Äì1910) Average Levels of Duties (1875 and 1913) Great Britain In the 14th century, Edward III (1312-1377) took interventionist measures, such as banning the import of woollen cloth in an attempt to develop local woollen cloth manufacturing. Beginning in 1489, Henry VII implemented plans such as increasing export duties on raw wool. The Tudor monarchs, especially Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, used protectionism, subsidies, distribution of monopoly rights, government-sponsored industrial espionage and other means of government intervention to develop the wool industry in England. England then became the largest wool-producing nation in the world. But the real protectionist turning point in British economic policy came in 1721. Policies to promote manufacturing industries were introduced from that date by Robert Walpole. These included, for example, increased tariffs on imported foreign manufactured goods and export subsidies. These policies were similar to those used by countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan after the Second World War. In addition, in its colonies, Great Britain imposed a total ban on advanced manufacturing activities that it did not want to see developed. Britain also banned exports from its colonies that competed with its own products at home and abroad, forcing the colonies to leave the most profitable industries in Britain's hands. In 1800, Britain, with about 10% of Europe's population, supplied 29% of all pig iron produced in Europe, a proportion that had risen to 45% by 1830; per capita industrial production was even higher: in 1830 it was 250% higher than in the rest of Europe, up from 110% in 1800. Protectionist policies of industrial promotion continued over the next century until the mid-19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, the average tariff on British manufactured goods was about 50%, the highest of all major European countries. Thus, according to economic historian Paul Bairoch, Britain's technological advance was achieved \\"behind high and enduring tariff barriers\\". In 1846, the per capita rate of industrialization was more than twice that of its closest competitors. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain's average tariff on manufactured goods was about 51%, the highest of all major European nations. And even after adopting free trade for most goods, Britain continued to closely regulate trade in strategic capital goods, such as machinery for the mass production of textiles . Free trade in Britain began in earnest with the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, which was equivalent to free trade in grain. The Corn Acts were passed in 1815 to restrict wheat imports and to guarantee the incomes of British farmers. This devastated Britain's old rural economy, but began to mitigate the effects of the Great Famine in Ireland. Tariffs on many manufactured goods were also abolished. But while liberalism was progressing in Britain, protectionism continued on the European continent and in the United States. On June 15, 1903, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquis of Lansdowne, made a speech in the House of Lords in which he defended fiscal retaliation against countries that applied high tariffs and whose governments subsidized products sold in Britain (known as \\"premium products\\", also known as \\"dumping (pricing policy)\\"). The retaliation was to take the form of threats to impose duties in response to goods from that country. Its liberal unionists had split from the liberals, who advocated free trade, and this speech marked a turning point in the group's slide toward protectionism. Landsdowne argued that the threat of retaliatory tariffs was similar to gaining respect in a room of gunmen by pointing a big gun (his exact words were \\"a gun a little bigger than everyone else's\\"). The \\"Big Revolver\\" became a slogan of the time, often used in speeches and cartoons Because of the Great Depression, Britain finally abandoned free trade in 1932 and reintroduced tariffs on a large scale, noticing that it had lost its production capacity to protectionist countries like the United States and Germany. United States Average tariff rates (France, UK, US) Average tariff rates in US (1821‚Äì2016) US Trade Balance and Trade Policy (1895‚Äì2015) Before the new Constitution took effect in 1788, the Congress could not levy taxesit sold land or begged money from the states. The new national government needed revenue and decided to depend upon a tax on imports with the Tariff of 1789.John C. Miller, The Federalist Era: 1789-1801 (1960), pp 14-15, The policy of the U.S. before 1860 was low tariffs \\"for revenue only\\" (since duties continued to fund the national government).Percy Ashley, \\"Modern Tariff History: Germany, United States, France (3rd ed. 1920) pp 133-265. A high tariff was attempted in 1828 but the South denounced it as a \\"Tariff of Abominations\\" and it almost caused a rebellion in South Carolina until it was lowered.Robert V. Remini, \\"Martin Van Buren and the Tariff of Abominations.\\" American Historical Review 63.4 (1958): 903-917. Between 1816 and the end of the Second World War, the United States had one of the highest average tariff rates on manufactured imports in the world. According to Paul Bairoch, the United States was \\"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\\"during this period Many American intellectuals and politicians during the country's catching-up period felt that the free trade theory advocated by British classical economists was not suited to their country. They argued that the country should develop manufacturing industries and use government protection and subsidies for this purpose, as Britain had done before them. Many of the great American economists of the time, until the last quarter of the 19th century, were strong advocates of industrial protection: Daniel Raymond who influenced Friedrich List, Mathew Carey and his son Henry, who was one of Lincoln's economic advisers. The intellectual leader of this movement was Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States (1789-1795). Thus, it was against David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage that the United States protected its industry. They pursued a protectionist policy from the beginning of the 19th century until the middle of the 20th century, after the Second World War.https://www.cepal.org/prensa/noticias/comunicados/8/7598/chang.pdf In Report on Manufactures, considered the first text to express modern protectionist theory, Alexander Hamilton argued that if a country wished to develop a new activity on its soil, it would have to temporarily protect it. According to him, this protection against foreign producers could take the form of import duties or, in rare cases, prohibition of imports. He called for customs barriers to allow American industrial development and to help protect infant industries, including bounties (subsidies) derived in part from those tariffs. He also believed that duties on raw materials should be generally low. Hamilton argued that despite an initial \\"increase of price\\" caused by regulations that control foreign competition, once a \\"domestic manufacture has attained to perfection‚Ä¶ it invariably becomes cheaper. He believed that political independence was predicated upon economic independence. Increasing the domestic supply of manufactured goods, particularly war materials, was seen as an issue of national security. And he feared that Britain's policy towards the colonies would condemn the United States to be only producers of agricultural products and raw materials. Britain initially did not want to industrialize the American colonies, and implemented policies to that effect (for example, banning high value-added manufacturing activities). Under British rule, America was denied the use of tariffs to protect its new industries. This explains why, after independence, the Tariff Act of 1789 was the second bill of the Republic signed by President Washington allowing Congress to impose a fixed tariff of 5% on all imports, with a few exceptions The Congress passed a tariff act (1789), imposing a 5% flat rate tariff on all imports. Between 1792 and the war with Britain in 1812, the average tariff level remained around 12.5%. In 1812 all tariffs were doubled to an average of 25% in order to cope with the increase in public expenditure due to the war. A significant shift in policy occurred in 1816, when a new law was introduced to keep the tariff level close to the wartime level‚Äîespecially protected were cotton, woolen, and iron goods. The American industrial interests that had blossomed because of the tariff lobbied to keep it, and had it raised to 35 percent in 1816. The public approved, and by 1820, America's average tariff was up to 40 percent. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Hamilton's themes within the Whig Party under the name \\"American System which consisted of protecting industries and developing infrastructure in explicit opposition to the \\"British system\\" of free trade. Before 1860 they were always defeated by the low-tariff Democrats.William K. Bolt, Tariff Wars and the Politics of Jacksonian America (2017) covers 1816 to 1861. From 1846 to 1861, during which American tariffs were lowered but this was followed by a series of recessions and the 1857 panic, which eventually led to higher demands for tariffs than President James Buchanan, signed in 1861 (Morrill Tariff). During the American Civil War (1861-1865), agrarian interests in the South were opposed to any protection, while manufacturing interests in the North wanted to maintain it. The war marked the triumph of the protectionists of the industrial states of the North over the free traders of the South. Abraham Lincoln was a protectionist like Henry Clay of the Whig Party, who advocated the \\"American system\\" based on infrastructure development and protectionism. In 1847, he declared: \\"Give us a protective tariff, and we will have the greatest nation on earth\\". Once elected, Lincoln raised industrial tariffs and after the war, tariffs remained at or above wartime levels. High tariffs were a policy designed to encourage rapid industrialisation and protect the high American wage rates. The policy from 1860 to 1933 was usually high protective tariffs (apart from 1913‚Äì21). After 1890, the tariff on wool did affect an important industry, but otherwise the tariffs were designed to keep American wages high. The conservative Republican tradition, typified by William McKinley was a high tariff, while the Democrats typically called for a lower tariff to help consumers but they always failed until 1913.F.W. Taussig,. The Tariff History of the United States. 8th edition (1931); 5th edition 1910 is onlineRobert W. Merry, President McKinley: Architect of the American Century (2017) pp 70-83. The Republican Party, which is heir to the Whigs, makes protectionism a central theme in its electoral platforms. According to the party, it is right to favour domestic producers and tax foreigners and consumers of imported luxury products. Republicans prioritize the protection function, while the need to provide revenue to the federal budget is only a secondary objective. In the early 1860s, Europe and the United States pursued completely different trade policies. The 1860s were a period of growing protectionism in the United States, while the European free trade phase lasted from 1860 to 1892. The tariff average rate on imports of manufactured goods was in 1875 from 40% to 50% in the United States against 9% to 12% in continental Europe at the height of free trade. In 1896, the GOP pledged platform pledged to \\"renew and emphasize our allegiance to the policy of protection, as the bulwark of American industrial independence, and the foundation of development and prosperity. This true American policy taxes foreign products and encourages home industry. It puts the burden of revenue on foreign goods; it secures the American market for the American producer. It upholds the American standard of wages for the American workingman\\".http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29629 In 1913, following the electoral victory of the Democrats in 1912, there was a significant reduction in the average tariff on manufactured goods from 44% to 25%. However, the First World War rendered this bill ineffective, and new \\"emergency\\" tariff legislation was introduced in 1922, after the Republicans returned to power in 1921. According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about United States trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. A review by the Economist of Irwin's 2017 book Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy notes: > Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the > economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for > tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them > again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving > the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated > the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism > made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer > lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing > powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the > time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In > some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But > American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its > abundant resources and openness to people and ideas. The economist Ha-Joon Chang, for his part, refutes the idea that the United States has developed and reached the top of the world economic hierarchy by adopting free trade. On the contrary, according to him, they have adopted an interventionist policy to promote and protect their industries through tariffs. It was their protectionist policy that would have allowed the United States to experience the fastest economic growth in the world throughout the 19th century and into the 1920s. =Tariffs and the Great Depression= Most economists hold the opinion that the US Tariff Act did not greatly worsen the great depression: Milton Friedman held the opinion that the Smoot‚ÄìHawley tariff of 1930 did not cause the Great Depression, instead he blamed the lack of sufficient action on the part of the Federal Reserve. Douglas A. Irwin wrote: \\"most economists, both liberal and conservative, doubt that Smoot‚ÄìHawley played much of a role in the subsequent contraction\\". Peter Temin, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained that a tariff is an expansionary policy, like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He noted that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concluded that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small. William Bernstein wrote: \\"Between 1929 and 1932, real GDP fell 17 percent worldwide, and by 26 percent in the United States, but most economic historians now believe that only a minuscule part of that huge loss of both world GDP and the United States‚Äô GDP can be ascribed to the tariff wars. .. At the time of Smoot-Hawley's passage, trade volume accounted for only about 9 percent of world economic output. Had all international trade been eliminated, and had no domestic use for the previously exported goods been found, world GDP would have fallen by the same amount ‚Äî 9 percent. Between 1930 and 1933, worldwide trade volume fell off by one-third to one- half. Depending on how the falloff is measured, this computes to 3 to 5 percent of world GDP, and these losses were partially made up by more expensive domestic goods. Thus, the damage done could not possibly have exceeded 1 or 2 percent of world GDP ‚Äî nowhere near the 17 percent falloff seen during the Great Depression... The inescapable conclusion: contrary to public perception, Smoot-Hawley did not cause, or even significantly deepen, the Great Depression,\\"(A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World, William Bernstein) Nobel laureate Maurice Allais argued: 'First, most of the trade contraction occurred between January 1930 and July 1932, before most protectionist measures were introduced, except for the limited measures applied by the United States in the summer of 1930. It was therefore the collapse of international liquidity that caused the contraction of trade[8], not customs tariffs'. Russia Russia adopted more protectionist trade measures in 2013 than any other country, making it the world leader in protectionism. It alone introduced 20% of protectionist measures worldwide and one-third of measures in the G20 countries. Russia's protectionist policies include tariff measures, import restrictions, sanitary measures, and direct subsidies to local companies. For example, the state supported several economic sectors such as agriculture, space, automotive, electronics, chemistry, and energy. India From 2017, as part of the promotion of its \\"Make in India\\" programme to stimulate and protect domestic manufacturing industry and to combat current account deficits, India has introduced tariffs on several electronic products and \\"non-essential items\\". This concerns items imported from countries such as China and South Korea. For example, India's national solar energy programme favours domestic producers by requiring the use of Indian-made solar cells. Armenia Armenia, a country located in Western Asia, established its custom service on January 4, 1992, as directed by the Armenian President. On January 2, 2015, Armenia was given access to the Eurasian Customs Union, which is led by the Russian Federation and the EAEU; this resulted in an increased number of import tariffs. Armenia does not currently have export taxes; in addition, it does not declare temporary imports duties and credit on government imports or pursuant to other international assistance imports. Customs duty A customs duty or due is the indirect tax levied on the import or export of goods in international trade. In economic sense, a duty is also a kind of consumption tax. A duty levied on goods being imported is referred to as an import duty. Similarly, a duty levied on exports is called an export duty. A tariff, which is actually a list of commodities along with the leviable rate (amount) of customs duty, is popularly referred to as a customs duty. Calculation of customs duty Customs duty is calculated on the determination of the assessable value in case of those items for which the duty is levied ad valorem. This is often the transaction value unless a customs officer determines assessable value in accordance with the Harmonized System. For certain items like petroleum and alcohol, customs duty is realized at a specific rate applied to the volume of the import or export consignments. Harmonized System of Nomenclature For the purpose of assessment of customs duty, products are given an identification code that has come to be known as the Harmonized System code. This code was developed by the World Customs Organization based in Brussels. A Harmonized System code may be from four to ten digits. For example, 17.03 is the HS code for molasses from the extraction or refining of sugar. However, within 17.03, the number 17.03.90 stands for \\"Molasses (Excluding Cane Molasses)\\". Introduction of Harmonized System code in the 1990s has largely replaced the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), though SITC remains in use for statistical purposes. In drawing up the national tariff, the revenue departments often specifies the rate of customs duty with reference to the HS code of the product. In some countries and customs unions, 6-digit HS codes are locally extended to 8 digits or 10 digits for further tariff discrimination: for example the European Union uses its 8-digit CN (Combined Nomenclature) and 10-digit TARIC codes. Customs authority A customs authority in each country is responsible for collecting taxes on the import into or export of goods out of the country. Normally the customs authority, operating under national law, is authorized to examine cargo in order to ascertain actual description, specification volume or quantity, so that the assessable value and the rate of duty may be correctly determined and applied. Evasion Evasion of customs duties takes place mainly in two ways. In one, the trader under-declares the value so that the assessable value is lower than actual. In a similar vein, a trader can evade customs duty by understatement of quantity or volume of the product of trade. A trader may also evade duty by misrepresenting traded goods, categorizing goods as items which attract lower customs duties. The evasion of customs duty may take place with or without the collaboration of customs officials. Duty-free goods Many countries allow a traveler to bring goods into the country duty-free. These goods may be bought at ports and airports or sometimes within one country without attracting the usual government taxes and then brought into another country duty-free. Some countries impose allowances which limit the number or value of duty-free items that one person can bring into the country. These restrictions often apply to tobacco, wine, spirits, cosmetics, gifts and souvenirs. Often foreign diplomats and UN officials are entitled to duty-free goods. Duty-free goods are imported and stocked in what is called a bonded warehouse. Duty calculation for companies in real life With many methods and regulations, businesses at times struggle to manage the duties. In addition to difficulties in calculations, there are challenges in analyzing duties; and to opt for duty free options like using a bonded warehouse. Companies use Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software to calculate duties automatically to, on the one hand, avoid error-prone manual work on duty regulations and formulas and, on the other hand, manage and analyze historically paid duties. Moreover, ERP software offers an option for customs warehouses to save duty and VAT payments. In addition, duty deferment and suspension can also be taken into consideration.  Economic analysis  Effects of import tariff, which hurts domestic consumers more than domestic producers are helped. Higher prices and lower quantities reduce consumer surplus by areas A+B+C+D, while expanding producer surplus by A and government revenue by C. Areas B and D are dead-weight losses, surplus lost by consumers and overall. Shows the consumer surplus, producer surplus, government revenue, and deadweight losses after tariff imposition. General government revenue, in % of GDP, from import taxes. For this data, the variance of GDP per capita with purchasing power parity (PPP) is explained in 38 % by tax revenue. Neoclassical economic theorists tend to view tariffs as distortions to the free market. Typical analyses find that tariffs tend to benefit domestic producers and government at the expense of consumers, and that the net welfare effects of a tariff on the importing country are negative. Normative judgments often follow from these findings, namely that it may be disadvantageous for a country to artificially shield an industry from world markets and that it might be better to allow a collapse to take place. Opposition to all tariff aims to reduce tariffs and to avoid countries discriminating between differing countries when applying tariffs. The diagrams at right show the costs and benefits of imposing a tariff on a good in the domestic economy. Imposing an import tariff has the following effects, shown in the first diagram in a hypothetical domestic market for televisions: *Price rises from world price Pw to higher tariff price Pt. *Quantity demanded by domestic consumers falls from C1 to C2, a movement along the demand curve due to higher price. *Domestic suppliers are willing to supply Q2 rather than Q1, a movement along the supply curve due to the higher price, so the quantity imported falls from C1-Q1 to C2-Q2. *Consumer surplus (the area under the demand curve but above price) shrinks by areas A+B+C+D, as domestic consumers face higher prices and consume lower quantities. *Producer surplus (the area above the supply curve but below price) increases by area A, as domestic producers shielded from international competition can sell more of their product at a higher price. *Government tax revenue is the import quantity (C2-Q2) times the tariff price (Pw - Pt), shown as area C. *Areas B and D are deadweight losses, surplus formerly captured by consumers that now is lost to all parties. The overall change in welfare = Change in Consumer Surplus + Change in Producer Surplus + Change in Government Revenue = (-A-B-C-D) + A + C = -B-D. The final state after imposition of the tariff is indicated in the second diagram, with overall welfare reduced by the areas labeled \\"societal losses\\", which correspond to areas B and D in the first diagram. The losses to domestic consumers are greater than the combined benefits to domestic producers and government. That tariffs overall reduce welfare is not a controversial topic among economists. For example, the University of Chicago surveyed about 40 leading economists in March 2018 asking whether \\"Imposing new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum will improve Americans'welfare.\\" About two-thirds strongly disagreed with the statement, while one third disagreed. None agreed or strongly agreed. Several commented that such tariffs would help a few Americans at the expense of many. This is consistent with the explanation provided above, which is that losses to domestic consumers outweigh gains to domestic producers and government, by the amount of deadweight losses. Tariffs are more inefficient than consumption taxes.  Optimal tariff  For economic efficiency, free trade is often the best policy, however levying a tariff is sometimes second best. A tariff is called an optimal tariff if it is set to maximize the welfare of the country imposing the tariff. It is a tariff derived by the intersection between the trade indifference curve of that country and the offer curve of another country. In this case, the welfare of the other country grows worse simultaneously, thus the policy is a kind of beggar thy neighbor policy. If the offer curve of the other country is a line through the origin point, the original country is in the condition of a small country, so any tariff worsens the welfare of the original country.Almost all real-life examples may be in this case. It is possible to levy a tariff as a political policy choice, and to consider a theoretical optimum tariff rate. However, imposing an optimal tariff will often lead to the foreign country increasing their tariffs as well, leading to a loss of welfare in both countries. When countries impose tariffs on each other, they will reach a position off the contract curve, meaning that both countries' welfare could be increased by reducing tariffs. Political analysis The tariff has been used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; for example, the United States Tariff Act of 1789, signed specifically on July 4, was called the \\"Second Declaration of Independence\\" by newspapers because it was intended to be the economic means to achieve the political goal of a sovereign and independent United States. The political impact of tariffs is judged depending on the political perspective; for example the 2002 United States steel tariff imposed a 30% tariff on a variety of imported steel products for a period of three years and American steel producers supported the tariff. Tariffs can emerge as a political issue prior to an election. In the leadup to the 2007 Australian Federal election, the Australian Labor Party announced it would undertake a review of Australian car tariffs if elected. The Liberal Party made a similar commitment, while independent candidate Nick Xenophon announced his intention to introduce tariff-based legislation as \\"a matter of urgency\\". Unpopular tariffs are known to have ignited social unrest, for example the 1905 meat riots in Chile that developed in protest against tariffs applied to the cattle imports from Argentina. Primeros movimientos sociales chileno (1890‚Äì1920). Memoria Chilena.Benjamin S. 1997. Meat and Strength: The Moral Economy of a Chilean Food Riot. Cultural Anthropology, 12, pp. 234‚Äì268. Arguments in favor of tariffs Protection of infant industry Postulated in the United States by Alexander Hamilton at the end of the 18th century, by Friedrich List in his 1841 book and by John Stuart Mill, the argument made in favour of this category of tariffs was this: should a country wish to develop a new economic activity on its soil, it would have to temporarily protect it. In their view, it is legitimate to protect certain activities by customs barriers in order to give them time to grow, to reach a sufficient size and to benefit from economies of scale through increased production and productivity gains. This would allow them to become competitive in order to face international competition. Indeed, a company needs to reach a certain production volume to be profitable in order to compensate for its fixed costs. Without protectionism, foreign products which are already profitable because of the volume of production already carried out on their soil would arrive in the country in large quantities at a lower price than local production. The recipient country's nascent industry would quickly disappear. A firm already established in an industry is more efficient because it is more adapted and has greater production capacity. New firms therefore suffer losses due to a lack of competitiveness linked to their 'apprenticeship' or catch-up period. By being protected from this external competition, firms can therefore establish themselves on their domestic market. As a result, they benefit from greater freedom of manoeuvre and greater certainty regarding their profitability and future development. The protectionist phase is therefore a learning period that would allow the least developed countries to acquire general and technical know-how in the fields of industrial production in order to become competitive on international markethttps://www.britannica.com/topic/international-trade/Arguments-for-and- against-interference According to the economists in favour of protecting industries, free trade would condemn developing countries to being nothing more than exporters of raw materials and importers of manufactured goods. The application of the theory of comparative advantage would lead them to specialize in the production of raw materials and extractive products and prevent them from acquiring an industrial base. Protection of infant industries (e.g. through tariffs on imported products) would therefore be essential for developing countries to industrialize and escape their dependence on the production of raw materials. Economist Ha-Joon Chang argues that most today's developed countries have pursued policies that are the opposite of free trade and laissez-faire. According to him, when they were developing countries themselves, almost all of them actively used interventionist trade and industrial policies to promote and protect infant industries. Instead, they would have encouraged their domestic industries through tariffs, subsidies and other measures. In his view, Britain and the United States have not reached the top of the global economic hierarchy by adopting free trade. In fact, these two countries would have been among the greatest users of protectionist measures, including tariffs. As for the East Asian countries, he points out that the longest periods of rapid growth in these countries do not coincide with extended phases of free trade, but rather with phases of industrial protection and promotion. Interventionist trade and industrial policies would have played a crucial role in their economic success. These policies would have been similar to those used by Britain in the 18th century and the United States in the 19th century. He considers that infant industry protection policy has generated much better growth performance in the developing world than free trade policies since the 1980s. In the second half of the 20th century, Nicholas Kaldor takes up similar arguments to allow the conversion of ageing industries. In this case, the aim was to save an activity threatened with extinction by external competition and to safeguard jobs. Protectionism must enable ageing companies to regain their competitiveness in the medium term and, for activities that are due to disappear, it allows the conversion of these activities and jobs.  Protection against dumping  States resorting to protectionism invoke unfair competition or dumping practices: * Monetary manipulation: a currency undergoes a devaluation when monetary authorities decide to intervene in the foreign exchange market to lower the value of the currency against other currencies. This makes local products more competitive and imported products more expensive (Marshall Lerner Condition), increasing exports and decreasing imports, and thus improving the trade balance. Countries with a weak currency cause trade imbalances: they have large external surpluses while their competitors have large deficits. * Tax dumping: some tax haven states have lower corporate and personal tax rates. * Social dumping: when a state reduces social contributions or maintains very low social standards (for example, in China, labour regulations are less restrictive for employers than elsewhere). * Environmental dumping: when environmental regulations are less stringent than elsewhere. Free trade and poverty Sub-Saharan African countries have a lower income per capita in 2003 than 40 years earlier (Ndulu, World Bank, 2007, p. 33). Per capita income increased by 37% between 1960 and 1980 and fell by 9% between 1980 and 2000. Africa's manufacturing sector's share of GDP decreased from 12% in 1980 to 11% in 2013. In the 1970s, Africa accounted for more than 3% of world manufacturing output, and now accounts for 1.5%. In an Op ed article for The Guardian (UK), Ha-Joon Chang argues that these downturns are the result of free trade policies, and elsewhere attributes successes in some African countries such as Ethiopia and Rwanda to their abandonment of free trade and adoption of a \\"developmental state model\\". The poor countries that have succeeded in achieving strong and sustainable growth are those that have become mercantilists, not free traders: China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan. Thus, whereas in the 1990s, China and India had the same GDP per capita, China followed a much more mercantilist policy and now has a GDP per capita three times higher than India's. Indeed, a significant part of China's rise on the international trade scene does not come from the supposed benefits of international competition but from the relocations practiced by companies from developed countries. Dani Rodrik points out that it is the countries that have systematically violated the rules of globalisation that have experienced the strongest growth. The 'dumping' policies of some countries have also largely affected developing countries. Studies on the effects of free trade show that the gains induced by WTO rules for developing countries are very small. This has reduced the gain for these countries from an estimated $539 billion in the 2003 LINKAGE model to $22 billion in the 2005 GTAP model. The 2005 LINKAGE version also reduced gains to 90 billion. As for the \\"Doha Round\\", it would have brought in only $4 billion to developing countries (including China...) according to the GTAP model. However, it has been argued that the models used are actually designed to maximize the positive effects of trade liberalization, that they are characterized by the absence of taking into account the loss of income caused by the end of tariff barriers. Criticism of the theory of comparative advantage Free trade is based on the theory of comparative advantage. The classical and neoclassical formulations of comparative advantage theory differ in the tools they use but share the same basis and logic. Comparative advantage theory says that market forces lead all factors of production to their best use in the economy. It indicates that international free trade would be beneficial for all participating countries as well as for the world as a whole because they could increase their overall production and consume more by specializing according to their comparative advantages. Goods would become cheaper and available in larger quantities. Moreover, this specialization would not be the result of chance or political intent, but would be automatic. However, according to non- neoclassical economists, the theory is based on assumptions that are neither theoretically nor empirically valid. ;International mobility of capital and labour The international immobility of labour and capital is essential to the theory of comparative advantage. Without this, there would be no reason for international free trade to be regulated by comparative advantages. Classical and neoclassical economists all assume that labour and capital do not circulate between nations. At the international level, only the goods produced can move freely, with capital and labour trapped in countries. David Ricardo was aware that the international immobility of labour and capital is an indispensable hypothesis. He devoted half of his explanation of the theory to it in his book. He even explained that if labour and capital could move internationally, then comparative advantages could not determine international trade. Ricardo assumed that the reasons for the immobility of the capital would be: Neoclassical economists, for their part, argue that the scale of these movements of workers and capital is negligible. They developed the theory of price compensation by factor that makes these movements superfluous. In practice, however, workers move in large numbers from one country to another. Today, labour migration is truly a global phenomenon. And, with the reduction in transport and communication costs, capital has become increasingly mobile and frequently moves from one country to another. Moreover, the neoclassical assumption that factors are trapped at the national level has no theoretical basis and the assumption of factor price equalisation cannot justify international immobility. Moreover, there is no evidence that factor prices are equal worldwide. Comparative advantages cannot therefore determine the structure of international trade. If they are internationally mobile and the most productive use of factors is in another country, then free trade will lead them to migrate to that country. This will benefit the nation to which they emigrate, but not necessarily the others. ;Externalities An externality is the term used when the price of a product does not reflect its cost or real economic value. The classic negative externality is environmental degradation, which reduces the value of natural resources without increasing the price of the product that has caused them harm. The classic positive externality is technological encroachment, where one company's invention of a product allows others to copy or build on it, generating wealth that the original company cannot capture. If prices are wrong due to positive or negative externalities, free trade will produce sub-optimal results. For example, goods from a country with lax pollution standards will be too cheap. As a result, its trading partners will import too much. And the exporting country will export too much, concentrating its economy too much in industries that are not as profitable as they seem, ignoring the damage caused by pollution. On the positive externalities, if an industry generates technological spinoffs for the rest of the economy, then free trade can let that industry be destroyed by foreign competition because the economy ignores its hidden value. Some industries generate new technologies, allow improvements in other industries and stimulate technological advances throughout the economy; losing these industries means losing all industries that would have resulted in the future. ;Cross-industrial movement of productive resources Comparative advantage theory deals with the best use of resources and how to put the economy to its best use. But this implies that the resources used to manufacture one product can be used to produce another object. If they cannot, imports will not push the economy into industries better suited to its comparative advantage and will only destroy existing industries. For example, when workers cannot move from one industry to another‚Äîusually because they do not have the right skills or do not live in the right place‚Äîchanges in the economy's comparative advantage will not shift them to a more appropriate industry, but rather to unemployment or precarious and unproductive jobs. ;Static vs. dynamic gains via international trade Comparative advantage theory allows for a \\"static\\" and not a \\"dynamic\\" analysis of the economy. That is, it examines the facts at a single point in time and determines the best response to those facts at that point in time, given our productivity in various industries. But when it comes to long-term growth, it says nothing about how the facts can change tomorrow and how they can be changed in someone's favour. It does not indicate how best to transform factors of production into more productive factors in the future. According to theory, the only advantage of international trade is that goods become cheaper and available in larger quantities. Improving the static efficiency of existing resources would therefore be the only advantage of international trade. And the neoclassical formulation assumes that the factors of production are given only exogenously. Exogenous changes can come from population growth, industrial policies, the rate of capital accumulation (propensity for security) and technological inventions, among others. Dynamic developments endogenous to trade such as economic growth are not integrated into Ricardo's theory. And this is not affected by what is called \\"dynamic comparative advantage\\". In these models, comparative advantages develop and change over time, but this change is not the result of trade itself, but of a change in exogenous factors. However, the world, and in particular the industrialized countries, are characterized by dynamic gains endogenous to trade, such as technological growth that has led to an increase in the standard of living and wealth of the industrialized world. In addition, dynamic gains are more important than static gains. ;Balanced trade and adjustment mechanisms A crucial assumption in both the classical and neoclassical formulation of comparative advantage theory is that trade is balanced, which means that the value of imports is equal to the value of each country's exports. The volume of trade may change, but international trade will always be balanced at least after a certain adjustment period. The balance of trade is essential for theory because the resulting adjustment mechanism is responsible for transforming the comparative advantages of production costs into absolute price advantages. And this is necessary because it is the absolute price differences that determine the international flow of goods. Since consumers buy a good from the one who sells it cheapest, comparative advantages in terms of production costs must be transformed into absolute price advantages. In the case of floating exchange rates, it is the exchange rate adjustment mechanism that is responsible for this transformation of comparative advantages into absolute price advantages. In the case of fixed exchange rates, neoclassical theory suggests that trade is balanced by changes in wage rates. So if trade were not balanced in itself and if there were no adjustment mechanism, there would be no reason to achieve a comparative advantage. However, trade imbalances are the norm and balanced trade is in practice only an exception. In addition, financial crises such as the Asian crisis of the 1990s show that balance of payments imbalances are rarely benign and do not self-regulate. There is no adjustment mechanism in practice. Comparative advantages do not turn into price differences and therefore cannot explain international trade flows. Thus, theory can very easily recommend a trade policy that gives us the highest possible standard of living in the short term but none in the long term. This is what happens when a nation runs a trade deficit, which necessarily means that it goes into debt with foreigners or sells its existing assets to them. Thus, the nation applies a frenzy of consumption in the short term followed by a long-term decline. ;International trade as bartering The assumption that trade will always be balanced is a corollary of the fact that trade is understood as barter. The definition of international trade as barter trade is the basis for the assumption of balanced trade. Ricardo insists that international trade takes place as if it were purely a barter trade, a presumption that is maintained by subsequent classical and neoclassical economists. The quantity of money theory, which Ricardo uses, assumes that money is neutral and neglects the velocity of a currency. Money has only one function in international trade, namely as a means of exchange to facilitate trade. In practice, however, the velocity of circulation is not constant and the quantity of money is not neutral for the real economy. A capitalist world is not characterized by a barter economy but by a market economy. The main difference in the context of international trade is that sales and purchases no longer necessarily have to coincide. The seller is not necessarily obliged to buy immediately. Thus, money is not only a means of exchange. It is above all a means of payment and is also used to store value, settle debts and transfer wealth. Thus, unlike the barter hypothesis of the comparative advantage theory, money is not a commodity like any other. Rather, it is of practical importance to specifically own money rather than any commodity. And money as a store of value in a world of uncertainty has a significant influence on the motives and decisions of wealth holders and producers. ;Using labour and capital to their full potential Ricardo and later classical economists assume that labour tends towards full employment and that capital is always fully used in a liberalized economy, because no capital owner will leave its capital unused but will always seek to make a profit from it. That there is no limit to the use of capital is a consequence of Jean-Baptiste Say's law, which presumes that production is limited only by resources and is also adopted by neoclassical economists. From a theoretical point of view, comparative advantage theory must assume that labour or capital is used to its full potential and that resources limit production. There are two reasons for this: the realization of gains through international trade and the adjustment mechanism. In addition, this assumption is necessary for the concept of opportunity costs. If unemployment (or underutilized resources) exists, there are no opportunity costs, because the production of one good can be increased without reducing the production of another good. Since comparative advantages are determined by opportunity costs in the neoclassical formulation, these cannot be calculated and this formulation would lose its logical basis. If a country's resources were not fully utilized, production and consumption could be increased at the national level without participating in international trade. The whole raison d'√™tre of international trade would disappear, as would the possible gains. In this case, a State could even earn more by refraining from participating in international trade and stimulating domestic production, as this would allow it to employ more labour and capital and increase national income. Moreover, any adjustment mechanism underlying the theory no longer works if unemployment exists. In practice, however, the world is characterised by unemployment. Unemployment and underemployment of capital and labour are not a short-term phenomenon, but it is common and widespread. Unemployment and untapped resources are more the rule than the exception.

(known informally as the Humphrey‚ÄìHawkins Full Employment Act) is an act of legislation by the United States government. Impetus and strategy Unemployment and inflation levels began to rise in the early 1970s, reviving fears of an economic recession. In the past, the country's economic policy had been defined by the Employment Act of 1946, which encouraged the federal government to pursue \\"maximum employment, production, and purchasing power\\" by cooperation with private enterprise. Some Representatives, dissatisfied with the vague wording of this act, sought to create an amendment that would strengthen and clarify the country's economic policy. The Act's sponsors embraced a form of Keynesian economics, advocating public intervention to increase economic demand and to secure full employment.Cate, T., An Encyclopedia of Keynesian Economics, 2nd ed. (Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013), p. 182. Consistent with Keynesian theory, the Act provides for measures to create public jobs to reduce unemployment, as applied during the Great Depression. The Act also encouraged the government to develop a sound monetary policy, to minimize inflation, and to push toward full employment by managing the amount and liquidity of currency in circulation. Overall, the Act sought to formalize and expand Congress's role in the economic policy process, as governed by the Federal Reserve and the President. Overview In response to rising unemployment levels in the 1970s, Representative Augustus Hawkins and Senator Hubert Humphrey created the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act. It was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on October 27, 1978, and codified as 15 USC ¬ß 3101. The Act explicitly instructs the nation to strive toward four ultimate goals: full employment, growth in production, price stability, and balance of trade and budget. By explicitly setting requirements and goals for the federal government to attain, the Act is markedly stronger than its predecessor (an alternate view is that the 1946 Act concentrated on employment, and Humphrey-Hawkins, by specifying four competing and possibly inconsistent goals, de-emphasized full employment as the sole primary national economic goal). In brief, the Act: * Explicitly states that the federal government will rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve the four goals. * Instructs the government to take reasonable means to balance the budget. * Instructs the government to establish a balance of trade, i.e., to avoid trade surpluses or deficits. * Mandates the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to establish a monetary policy that maintains long-run growth, minimizes inflation, and promotes price stability. * Instructs the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to transmit a Monetary Policy Report to the Congress twice a year outlining its monetary policy. * Requires the President to set numerical goals for the economy of the next fiscal year in the Economic Report of the President and to suggest policies that will achieve these goals. * Requires the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to connect the monetary policy with the Presidential economic policy. The Act set specific numerical goals for the President to attain. By 1983, unemployment rates should be not more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over, and inflation rates should not be over 4%. By 1988, inflation rates should be 0%. The Act allows Congress to revise these goals over time. (It is worth noting that as of 2017 the Federal Reserve has had a target inflation rate of 2%, not 0%. 0% inflation is not considered ideal and can lead to deflation which can hurt the economy). If private enterprise appeared not to be meeting these goals, the Act in its original form, though not in its ultimate iteration, expressly allowed the federal government to create a \\"reservoir of public employment,\\" provided of course that the legislation to establish the \\"reservoir\\" managed to become ratified. These jobs would have been required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay to minimize competition with the private sector. The Act directly prohibits discrimination on account of sex, religion, race, age, and national origin in any program created under the Act. Amendments The language of the Act was amended twice by riders, attached to unrelated or distantly related legislation. # May 10, 1979: Public Law 96-10, attached to H.R. 2283, amended the Act to include federal outlays as a proportion of the gross national product when numerical goals are calculated. # November 5, 1990: Public Law 101-508, attached to the Pollution Prevention Act, required the Economic Report to the President to be submitted within 20 days after the start of the session of Congress instead of 10 days after the submission of the annual budget.

ChronoZoom is an example of interactive, zoomable timeline software. The bronze timeline \\"Fifteen meters of History\\" with background information board, √ñrebro, Sweden. A timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events; a Gantt chart is a form of timeline used in project management. Timelines can use any suitable scale representing time, suiting the subject and data; many use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and that of an explosion over milliseconds. While many timelines use a linear timescale‚Äîespecially where very large or small timespans are relevant -- logarithmic timelines entail a logarithmic scale of time; some \\"hurry up and wait\\" chronologies are depicted with zoom lens metaphors.  Types  There are different types of timelines * Text timelines, labeled as text * Number timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly line graphs * Interactive, clickable, zoomable There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data. Timelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. ChronoZoom is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software. Uses of timelines Timelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject. When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.  In historical studies  Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies. Examples include: * Timeline of the civil rights movement * Timeline of European exploration * Timeline of imperialism * Timeline of Solar System exploration * Timeline of United States history * Timeline of World War I * Timeline of religion  In natural sciences Timelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, for subjects such as astronomy, biology, and geology: *2009 flu pandemic timeline *Chronology of the universe *Geologic time scale *Timeline of evolutionary history of life  In project management Another type of timeline is used for project management.

It was to protect manufacturing industries developing in the nation and was to raise revenue for the federal government. It was sponsored by Congressman James Madison, passed by the 1st United States Congress, and signed into law by President George Washington. The act levied a 50¬¢ per ton duty on goods imported by foreign ships; American-owned vessels were charged 6¬¢ per ton. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the weak Congress of the Confederation had been unable to impose a tariff or reach reciprocal trade agreements with most European powers, creating a situation in which the country was unable to prevent a flood of European goods which were damaging domestic manufacturers even while Britain and other countries placed high duties on U.S. goods. The country also faced major debts left over from the Revolutionary War, and needed new sources of funding to maintain financial solvency. One of the major powers granted under the new Constitution was the ability to levy tariffs, and after the 1st Congress was seated, passage of a tariff bill became one of the most pressing issues. The debates over the purpose of the tariff exposed the sectional interests at stake: Northern manufacturers favored high duties to protect industry; Southern planters desired a low tariff that would foster cheap consumer imports. Ultimately, Madison navigated the tariff to passage, but he was unable to include a provision in the final bill that would have discriminated against British imports. After passing both houses of Congress, President Washington signed the act in law on July 7 1789. The tariff would form the bulk of federal revenue in subsequent years. Economic conditions prior to passage The American Revolution was followed by an economic reorganization, which carried in its wake a period of uncertainty and hard times. During the conflict, labor and investment had been diverted from agriculture and legitimate trade to manufacturing and privateers. Men had gone into occupations that ceased with the end of the war. Lowered prices, resulting from the cessation of war demands, in combination with the importation of the cheaper goods of Europe, were fast ruining such infant manufacturing concerns as had sprung up during the war, some of which were at a comparative disadvantage with the resumption of normal foreign trading relations.Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers, 1938, p. 181 Another factor which made the situation even more distressing was the British Navigation Acts. The only clause in the treaty of peace (1783) concerning commerce was a stipulation guaranteeing that the navigation of the Mississippi would be forever free to the United States. John Jay had tried to secure some reciprocal trade provisions with Great Britain but without result. Pitt, in 1783, introduced a bill into the British Parliament providing for free trade between the United States and the British colonies, but instead of passing the bill, Parliament enacted the British Navigation Act 1783, which admitted only British built and manned ships to the ports of the West Indies, and imposed heavy tonnage dues upon American ships in other British ports. It was amplified in 1786 by another act designed to prevent the fraudulent registration of American vessels and by still another in 1787, which prohibited the importation of American goods by way of foreign islands. The favorable features of the old Navigation Acts that had granted bounties and reserved the English markets in certain cases to colonial products were gone; the unfavorable ones were left. The British market was further curtailed by the depression there after 1783. Although the French treaty of 1778 had promised \\"perfect equality and reciprocity\\" in commercial relations, it was found impossible to make a commercial treaty on that basis. Spain demanded, as the price for reciprocal trading relations, a surrender by the United States for 25 years the right of navigating the Mississippi, a price that the New England merchants would have been glad to pay. France (1778) and the Netherlands (1782) made treaties but not on even terms; Portugal refused all advances. Only Sweden (1783) and Prussia (1785) made treaties guaranteeing reciprocal commercial privileges.Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers, 1938, p. 182 The weakness of Congress under the Articles of Confederation prevented retaliation by the central government. Congress repeatedly asked for power to regulate commerce.but was refused by the states upon which rested the execution of such commercial treaties as Congress might negotiate. Eventually, the states themselves attempted retaliatory measures, and from 1783 to 1788, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia levied tonnage dues upon British vessels or discriminating tariffs upon British goods. Whatever effect these efforts might have had were neutralized by the fact that the duties varied 0% to 100%, which simply drove British ships to the free or cheapest ports to flood the market with their goods. Commercial war between the states followed and turned futility into chaos. Adoption of the Constitution meant the elimination of many of the economic ills under which industry and commerce had struggled since the war. A reorganization was essential and the immediate economic results were salutary. Its most important additions to the power of Congress were those relating to finance and commerce: it enabled the federal government to levy taxes, regulate trade, coin money, protect industry, and direct the settlement of the West, and, as later events proved, to establish credit and redeem its securities. Under it, freedom of trade was insured throughout the young republic.Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers, 1938, p. 190 In the months leading up to the passage of the Tariff Act, Congress received several petitions from different cities representing manufacturing groups asking for relief from the flood of European imported goods. The United States Congress answered the petitions of these groups for urgent attention, by making the Tariff of 1789 the first major bill to be considered in its first session and passed. Import duty legislation and American sectional interests The import fees \\"represented a compromise between the advocates of a high protective tariff and those who favored a tariff for revenue only [to maintain the central government].\\"Miller, 1960, p. 15 Charges up to fifty percent were imposed on selected manufactured and agricultural goods, including \\"steel, ships, cordage, tobacco, salt, indigo [and] cloth.\\" On the majority of items subject to duty, a five percent fee was levied, ad valorem. Molasses, an indispensable ingredient for Northeastern rum producers, was lowered from 6¬¢ per gallon to 2.5¬¢. Madison modified the terms of the tariff to balance sectional conflicts but conceded that articles subject to high duties \\"were pretty generally taxed for the benefit of the manufacturing part of the northern community.\\"Miller, 1960, p. 16 He acknowledged the South, the main wealth-producing part of the nation, would inevitably \\"shoulder a disproportionate share of the financial burden involved in the transforming the United States into a commercial, manufacturing, and maritime power.\\"Miller, 1960, p. 18 Tonnage duty legislation and US foreign relations In its final form, the tariff erected \\"an American navigation system,\\" superseding the individual state sanctioned fees designed to protect domestic shipping during the Articles of Confederation period from 1781 to 1789.Hofstadter, 1957, p. 115 The act established tonnage rates favorable to American carriers by charging them lower cargo fees than those imposed on foreign boats importing similar goods. Coastal trade was reserved exclusively for American flag vessels. These provisions were consistent with mercantilist policies practice by European powers at the time.Miller, 1960, p. 19 Dating from the Treaty of Paris, ending the War for Independence in 1783, Great Britain had declined to seek a commercial treaty with the United States.Hofstadter, 1957, p. 125 In addition, provisions of the treaty had gone unfulfilled, including compensation to slaveholders for slaves emancipated by the British Navy during the War and the failure to abandon military posts in the Northwest Territory.Hofstadter, 1957, p. 123 Still, Great Britain remained the dominant trading partner for the United States, the countries reverting to an essentially colonial-era trade relationship. Representative James Madison, presiding over the tariff debates in Congress, attempted to introduce discriminatory provisions into the tonnage legislation that would favor France and its colonial possessions and shift American trade away from Great Britain. To effect this, Madison called for a 60¬¢ per ton fee upon foreign carriers lacking a commercial agreement with the United States, while France, which possessed a treaty, would be charged tonnage at 30¬¢. This measure alone \\"was equivalent to levying economic war\\" upon Great Britain.Miller, 1960, p. 16-17 Madison's proposals were intended to unify politically the agricultural and manufacturing interests in support of that commercial realignment at the national level, damaging to Great Britain and beneficial to revolutionary France.Miller, 1960, p. 16-17, p. 126-127 Many representatives of northern business were wary of abandoning Great Britain as their primary trading partner and merchant marine and questioned whether France could ever act \\"as the principle supplier and market for the United States.\\" The House of Representatives, nevertheless, initially passed Madison's \\"controversial\\" legislation, with the discriminatory provision intact. The Senate, however, removed it from the bill and sent it back to the House, where it was passed, without amendment, 31 to 19, on July 4, 1789.Miller, 1960, p. 19 President Washington signed the act into law on July 4, 1789.Miller, 1960, p. 15, p. 14-15 The final bill extracted concessions from both interests, but delivered a distinct advantage to maritime and manufacturing regions of the country.Miller, 1960, p. 17-18Malone, 1960, p. 256 The Tariff of 1789 placed France and Great Britain on an equal footing with regard to shipping, manufactures, and raw products delivered to American ports. All foreign-owned or foreign-built ships paid 50¬¢ per ton duty; American-owned vessels were charged 6¬¢ per ton. To enable the federal government to collect the import duties, Congress also passed the Collection Act of 1789, which established the United States Customs Service and designated ports of entry., pp. 102‚Äì103 The tariffs established by this and later acts would make up the vast majority of government revenue; more than 87 percent of the federal government's revenue between 1789 and 1800 came from import duties., p. 108 The tariff would continue to make up the bulk of federal revenue until the 20th century. Political and sectional responses to the tariff Madison's attempt to enlist northern merchants and businessmen in supporting an economic contest with Great Britain elicited a cool response.Miller, 1960, p. 18, p. 19 Firstly, British capital and markets contributed to the general prosperity of the North, and secondly, a shift towards France would mean aligning the United States with a revolutionary government that exhibited what Federalist leadership regarded as \\"an excess of democracy.\\"Brock, 1957, p. 47-48Miller, 1960, p. 100 Alexander Hamilton, soon to enter the executive branch as Secretary of the Treasury, declined to support Madison's proposal and warned that economic warfare with Great Britain would drastically reduce the import duty revenue that the tariff legislation called for, placing at risk the funds anticipated to run the new federal government and finance the national debt. This dispute between Madison and Hamilton marked \\"the first important breach\\" between these two Federalist leaders, which would deepen when Hamilton, as Treasury Secretary, launched his fiscal and economic programs, ending their long collaboration.Miller, 1960, p. 100-101 The legislation produced the first sectional strains within \\"the Federalist coalition of northern businessmen and southern planters.\\" In the South, \\"agricultural interests\\" viewed the high tariff and tonnage rates as a triumph for northern merchants and manufacturers, the burden of which fell on southern staple crop exporters. This early application of constitutional authority highlighted north-south social and economic differences and presaged the dissolution of the Federalist coalition, the formation of an agrarian alliance,Hofstadter, 1948, p. 14 and the rise of the First Party System.Miller, 1960, p. 101Malone, 1960, p. 265 Notes Further reading * Bordewich, Fergus M.

When improved in the 1830s, it became the second U.S. road surfaced with the macadam process pioneered by Scotsman John Loudon McAdam. Construction began heading west in 1811 at Cumberland, Maryland, on the Potomac River. After the Financial Panic of 1837 and the resulting economic depression, congressional funding ran dry and construction was stopped at Vandalia, Illinois, the then capital of Illinois, Measured 63 mi straight-line distance, GoogleEarth ruler northeast of St. Louis across the Mississippi River. The road has also been referred to as the Cumberland Turnpike, the Cumberland‚ÄìBrownsville Turnpike (or Road or Pike), the Cumberland Pike, the National Pike, and the National Turnpike. In the 20th century with the advent of the automobile, the National Road was connected with other historic routes to California under the title, National Old Trails Road. Today, much of the alignment is followed by U.S. Route 40, with various portions bearing the Alternate U.S. Route 40 designation, or various state-road numbers (such as Maryland Route 144 for several sections between Baltimore and Cumberland). In 1976, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the national road as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. In 2002, the full road, including extensions east to Baltimore and west to St. Louis, was designated the Historic National Road, an All-American Road. History Braddock Road The Braddock Road had been opened by the Ohio Company in 1751 between Fort Cumberland, the limit of navigation on the upper Potomac River, and the French military station at Fort Duquesne at the forks of the Ohio River, (at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers), an important trading and military point where the city of Pittsburgh now stands. It received its name during the colonial-era French and Indian War of 1753‚Äì63 (also known as the Seven Years' War in Europe), when it was constructed by British General Edward Braddock who was accompanied by Colonel George Washington of the Virginia militia regiment in the ill-fated July 1755 Braddock expedition, an attempt to assault the French- held Fort Duquesne. Cumberland Road Start of the Cumberland National Road marker Construction of the Cumberland Road (which later became part of the longer National Road) was authorized on March 29, 1806, by Congress. The new Cumberland Road would replace the wagon and foot paths of the Braddock Road for travel between the Potomac and Ohio Rivers, following roughly the same alignment until just east of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. From there, where the Braddock Road turned north towards Pittsburgh, the new National Road/Cumberland Road continued west to Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), also on the Ohio River. The contract for the construction of the first section was awarded to Henry McKinley on May 8, 1811, and construction began later that year, with the road reaching Wheeling on August 1, 1818. For more than 100 years, a simple granite stone was the only marker of the road's beginning in Cumberland, Maryland. In June 2012, a monument and plaza were built in that town's Riverside Park, next to the historic original starting point. Beyond the National Road's eastern terminus at Cumberland and toward the Atlantic coast, a series of private toll roads and turnpikes were constructed, connecting the National Road (also known as the Old National Pike) with Baltimore, then the third-largest city in the country, and a major maritime port on Chesapeake Bay. Completed in 1824, these feeder routes formed what is referred to as an eastern extension of the federal National Road. Westward extension The Wheeling Suspension Bridge across the Ohio River was completed in 1849 and was still in use by local traffic until its closure on September 24, 2019. The bridge is now limited to pedestrians only. On May 15, 1820, Congress authorized an extension of the road to St. Louis, on the Mississippi River, and on March 3, 1825, across the Mississippi and to Jefferson City, Missouri. Work on the extension between Wheeling and Zanesville, Ohio, used the pre-existing Zane's Trace of old Ebenezer Zane, and was completed in 1833 to the new state capital of Columbus, Ohio, and in 1838 to the college town of Springfield, Ohio. In 1849, a bridge was completed to carry the National Road across the Ohio River at Wheeling. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge, designed by Charles Ellet Jr., was at the time the world's longest bridge span at from tower to tower. Transfer to states The Cumberland Narrows west of Cumberland, part of the realigned routing Maintenance costs on the Cumberland Road were becoming more than Congress was willing to bear. In agreements with Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, the road was to be reconstructed and resurfaced. The section that ran over Haystack Mountain, just west of Cumberland, was abandoned and a new road was built through the Cumberland Narrows. On April 1, 1835, the section from Wheeling to Cumberland was transferred to Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia (now West Virginia). The last congressional appropriation was made May 25, 1838, and in 1840, Congress voted against completing the unfinished portion of the road, with the deciding vote being cast by Henry Clay. By that time, railroads were proving a better method of long-distance transportation, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was being built west from Baltimore to Cumberland, mostly along the Potomac River, and then by a more direct route than the National Road across the Allegheny Plateau of West Virginia (then Virginia) to Wheeling. Construction of the National Road stopped in 1839. Much of the road through Indiana and Illinois remained unfinished and was transferred to the states. Federal construction of the road stopped at Vandalia, Illinois, which at that time was the state's capital. Illinois officials decided not to continue construction without the federal funds because two state roads to the St. Louis area (today's U.S. 40 and Illinois Route 140 (known then as the Alton Road)), already existed. Subsequent events Madonna of the Trail monument along the Old National Road in Vandalia, Illinois In 1912, the National Road was chosen to become part of the National Old Trails Road, which would extend further east to New York City and west to Los Angeles, California. Five Madonna of the Trail monuments, donated by the Daughters of the American Revolution, were erected along the old National Road. In 1927, the National Road was designated as the eastern part of U.S. Highway 40, which still generally follows the National Road's alignment with occasional bypasses, realignments, and newer bridges. The mostly parallel Interstate 70 now provides a faster route for through travel without the many sharp curves, steep grades, and narrow bridges of U.S. 40 and other segments of the National Road. However, between Hancock in western Maryland and Washington, Pennsylvania, I-70 takes a more northerly path to connect with and follow the Pennsylvania Turnpike (also designated as I-76) across the mountains between Breezewood and New Stanton, where I-70 turns west to rejoin the National Road's route (and U.S 40) near Washington, Pennsylvania. The more recently constructed Interstate 68 parallels the old road from Hancock through Cumberland west to Keyser's Ridge, Maryland, where the National Road and U.S. 40 turn northwest into Pennsylvania, but I-68 continues directly west to meet Interstate 79 near Morgantown, West Virginia. The portion of I-68 in Maryland is designated as the National Freeway. Historical structures Casselman River Bridge in western Maryland, completed in 1814 Mile marker along the National Road in Columbus, Ohio Many of the National Road's original stone arch bridges also remain on former alignments, including: * Casselman River Bridge near Grantsville, MarylandBuilt in 1813‚Äì1814 to carry the road across the Casselman River, it was the longest single-span stone arch bridge in America at the time. * Great Crossings Bridge near Confluence, PennsylvaniaBuilt in 1818 to carry the road over the Youghiogheny River, the bridge, and the adjacent town of Somerfield, Pennsylvania (which was razed) are under the waters of Youghiogheny River Lake (though still visible at times of extremely low water levels). Another remaining National Road bridge is the Wheeling Suspension Bridge at Wheeling, West Virginia. Opened in 1849 to carry the road over the Ohio River, it was the largest suspension bridge in the world until 1851, and is today the oldest vehicular suspension bridge in the United States still in use. A newer bridge now carries the realigned U.S. 40 and I-70 across the river nearby. Three of the road's original toll houses are preserved: * La Vale Tollgate House, La Vale, Maryland * Petersburg Tollhouse, Addison, Pennsylvania * Searights Tollhouse, near Uniontown, Pennsylvania Additionally, several Old National Pike Milestones‚Äîsome well-maintained, others deteriorating, and yet others represented by modern replacements‚Äîremain intact along the route. Route description The S Bridge on the National Road east of Old Washington, Ohio Madonna of the Trail in Richmond, Indiana, with the National Road in the background In general, the road climbed westwards along the Amerindian trail known as Chief Nemacolin's Path, once followed and improved by a young George Washington, then also followed by the Braddock Expedition. Using the Cumberland Narrows, its first phase of construction crossed the Allegheny Mountains entered southwestern Pennsylvania, reaching the Allegheny Plateau in Somerset County, Pennsylvania. There, travelers could turn off to Pittsburgh or continue west through Uniontown and reach navigable water, the Monongahela River, at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, which was by then a major outfitting center and riverboat-building emporium. Many settlers boarded boats there to travel down the Ohio and up the Missouri, or elsewhere on the Mississippi watershed. By 1818, travelers could press on, still following Chief Nemacolin's trail across the ford, or taking a ferry to West Brownsville, moving through Washington County, Pennsylvania, and passing into Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), Measured 45 mi straight-line distance, GoogleEarth ruler, US Route 40 path and Nemacolin Trail are longer; both bend north through Summit Hill and Washington, PA. away on the Ohio River. Subsequent efforts pushed the road across the states of Ohio and Indiana and into the Illinois Territory. The western terminus of the National Road at its greatest extent was at the Kaskaskia River in Vandalia, Illinois, near the intersection of modern U.S. 51 and U.S. 40. Today, travelers driving east from Vandalia travel along modern U.S. 40 through south-central Illinois. The National Road continued into Indiana along modern U.S. 40, passing by the cities of Terre Haute and Indianapolis. Within Indianapolis, the National Road used the original alignment of U.S. 40 along West and East Washington Street (modern U.S. 40 is now routed along I-465). East of Indianapolis, the road went through the city of Richmond before entering Ohio, where the road continued along modern U.S. 40 and passed through the northern suburbs of Dayton, Springfield, and Columbus. West of Zanesville, Ohio, despite U.S. 40's predominantly following the original route, many segments of the original road can still be found. Between Old Washington and Morristown, the original roadbed has been overlaid by I-70. The road then continued east across the Ohio River into Wheeling in West Virginia, the original western end of the National Road when it was first paved. After running in West Virginia, the National Road then entered Pennsylvania. The road cut across southwestern Pennsylvania, heading southeast for about before entering Maryland. East of Keyser's Ridge, the road used modern Alternate U.S. 40 to the city of Cumberland (modern U.S. 40 is now routed along I-68). Cumberland was the original eastern terminus of the road. In the mid-19th century, a turnpike extension to Baltimore‚Äîalong what is now Maryland Route 144 from Cumberland to Hancock, U.S. 40 from Hancock to Hagerstown, Alternate U.S. 40 from Hagerstown to Frederick, and Maryland Route 144 from Frederick to Baltimore‚Äîwas approved. The approval process was a hotly debated subject because of the removal of the original macadam construction that made this road famous. The road's route between Baltimore and Cumberland continues to use the name National Pike or Baltimore National Pike and as Main Street in Ohio today, with various portions now signed as U.S. Route 40, Alternate U.S. 40, or Maryland 144. A spur between Frederick, Maryland, and Georgetown (Washington, D.C.), now Maryland Route 355, bears various local names, but is sometimes referred to as the Washington National Pike; it is now paralleled by Interstate 270 between the Capital Beltway (I-495) and Frederick. Historic designations These structures associated with the National Road are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: * Sixty-nine milestones in Maryland on Maryland Route 144 and Maryland Route 165, U.S. Route 40, U.S. Route 40 Alternate, and U.S. Route 40 Scenic * Inns on the National Road in Cumberland, Maryland, and Grantsville, Maryland * Casselman River Bridge near Grantsville, Maryland * Petersburg Tollhouse in Addison, Pennsylvania * Mount Washington Tavern adjacent to the Fort Necessity National Battlefield in Wharton Township, Pennsylvania * Searights Tollhouse, National Road, in Uniontown, Pennsylvania * Dunlap's Creek Bridge, near Brownsville, Pennsylvania, the first cast iron arch bridge in the United States.

As a successor or replacement law for the 1806 Non-importation Act and passed as the Napoleonic Wars continued, it represented an escalation of attempts to coerce Britain to stop its impressment of American sailors and to respect American sovereignty and neutrality but also attempted to pressure France and other nations in the pursuit of general diplomatic and economic leverage. In the first decade of the 19th century, American merchant shipping grew. Particularly Britain but also France thus targeted neutral American shipping as a means to disrupt enemy trade. American merchantmen, their cargo, and sometimes crew members were seized as contraband of war by European navies, sometimes under cover of official orders. The British Royal Navy, in particular, resorted to impressment and forced some American seamen into naval service on the pretext that the seamen had been \\"born British\\" and were still British subjects. Americans saw the Chesapeake‚ÄìLeopard affair as a glaring example of a British violation of American neutrality. Congress imposed the embargo in direct response to these events. US President Thomas Jefferson acted with restraint, weighed public support for retaliation, and recognized that the United States was far weaker than either Britain or France. He recommended that Congress respond with commercial warfare, a policy that appealed to Jefferson both for being experimental and for foreseeably harming his domestic political opponents more than his allies, whatever its effect on the European belligerents. The 10th Congress was controlled by his allies and agreed to the Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 1807. The embargo failed totally. It did not improve the American diplomatic position, highlighted American weakness and lack of leverage, significantly damaged only the American economy, and sharply increased domestic political tensions. Both widespread evasion of the embargo and loopholes in the legislation reduced its impact on its targets. British commercial shipping, which already dominated global trade, was successfully adapting to Napoleon's Continental System by pursuing new markets, particularly in the restive Spanish and Portuguese South American colonies. Thus, British shippers were well-positioned to grow at American expense when the embargo reduced American trade activity. The embargo undermined American unity by provoking bitter protests, particularly in New England commercial centers. Support for the declining Federalist Party, which intensely opposed Jefferson, temporarily rebounded and drove electoral gains in 1808. The embargo simultaneously undermined Americans' faith that their government could execute laws fairly and strengthened the European perception that the republican form of government was inept and ineffectual. Replacement legislation for the ineffective embargo was enacted on March 1, 1809, in the last days of Jefferson's presidency. Tensions with Britain continued to grow and eventually led to the War of 1812. Background After the short truce in 1802‚Äì1803, the European wars resumed and continued until the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814.Napoleon's brief return during the \\"Hundred Days\\" had no bearing on the United States. The war caused US relations with both Britain and France to deteriorate rapidly. There was grave risk of war with one or the other. With Britain supreme on the sea and France on the land, the war developed into a struggle of blockade and counterblockade. The commercial war peaked in 1806 and 1807. Britain's Royal Navy shut down most European harbors to American ships unless they first traded through British ports. France declared a paper blockade of Britain but lacked a navy that could enforce it and seized American ships that obeyed British regulations. The Royal Navy needed large numbers of sailors, and saw the US merchant fleet as a haven for British deserting sailors. Thomas Jefferson The British system of impressment humiliated and dishonored the US, which was unable to protect its ships and their sailors. The British practice of taking British deserters, often Americans, from American ships and forcing them into the Royal Navy increased greatly after 1803, and it caused bitter anger in the United States. On June 21, 1807, an American warship, the USS Chesapeake, was attacked and boarded on the high seas off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia by a British warship, the HMS Leopard. Three Americans were dead and 18 wounded; the British impressed four seamen with American papers as alleged deserters. The outraged nation demanded action, and President Jefferson ordered all British ships out of American waters. Initial legislation Passed on December 22, 1807, the Act did the following:2 Stat. 451 (1807) Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774‚Äì1875 * An embargo was laid on all ships and vessels under US jurisdiction. * All ships and vessels were prevented from obtaining clearance to undertake in voyages to foreign ports or places. * The US President was allowed to make exceptions for ships under his immediate direction. * The President was authorized to enforce via instructions to revenue officers and the Navy. * It was not constructed to prevent the departure of any foreign ship or vessel, with or without cargo on board, * A bond or surety was required from merchant ships on a voyage between US ports. * Warships were exempted from the embargo provisions. The shipping embargo was a cumulative addition to the Non-importation Act of 1806 (2 Stat. 379), which was a \\"Prohibition of the Importation of certain Goods and Merchandise from the Kingdom of Great Britain,\\" the prohibited imported goods being defined where their chief value, which consists of leather, silk, hemp or flax, tin or brass, wool, glass, and paper goods, nails, hats, clothing, and beer.2 Stat. 379 (1806) Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774‚Äì1875 The Embargo Act of 1807 was codified at 2 Stat. 451 and formally titled \\"An Embargo laid on Ships and Vessels in the Ports and Harbours of the United States.\\" The bill was drafted at the request of President Thomas Jefferson and was passed by the 10th Congress on December 22, 1807, during Session 1; Chapter 5. Congress initially acted to enforce a bill prohibiting only imports, but supplements to the bill eventually banned exports as well. Impact on US trade The embargo effectively throttled American overseas trade. All areas of the nation suffered. In commercial New England and the Middle Atlantic, ships sat idle. In agricultural areas, particularly the South, farmers and planters could not sell crops internationally. Scarcity of European goods stimulated American manufacturing, particularly in the North, but with manufacturing in its infancy and with Britain still able to export to America particularly through Canada, that benefit did not compensate for the loss of trade and economic momentum. A 2005 study by the economic historian Douglas Irwin estimates that the embargo cost about 5% of America's 1807 gross national product. Case studies A case study of Rhode Island shows the embargo to have devastated shipping-related industries, wrecked existing markets, and caused an increase in opposition to the Democratic‚ÄìRepublican Party. Smuggling was widely endorsed by the public, which viewed the embargo as a violation of its rights. Public outcry continued and helped the Federalists regain control of the state government in 1808‚Äì1809. The case is a rare example of American national foreign policy altering local patterns of political allegiance. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act had some limited unintended benefits to the Northeast, especially by driving capital and labor into New England textile and other manufacturing industries, which lessened America's reliance on the British. In Vermont, the embargo was doomed to failure on the Lake Champlain‚ÄìRichelieu River water route because of the state's dependence on a Canadian outlet for produce. At St. John, Lower Canada, ¬£140,000 worth of goods smuggled by water were recorded there in 1808, a 31% increase over 1807. Shipments of ashes to make soap nearly doubled to ¬£54,000, but those of lumber dropped by 23% to ¬£11,200. Manufactured goods, which had expanded to ¬£50,000 since Jay's Treaty in 1795, fell by over 20%, especially articles made near tidewater. Newspapers and manuscripts recorded more lake activity than usual, despite the theoretical reduction in shipping that should accompany an embargo. The smuggling was not restricted to water routes, as herds were readily driven across the uncontrollable land border. Southbound commerce gained two thirds overall, but furs dropped a third. Customs officials maintained a stance of vigorous enforcement throughout, and Gallatin's Enforcement Act (1809) was a party issue. Many Vermonters preferred the embargo's exciting game of revenuers versus smugglers, which brought high profits, versus mundane, low- profit normal trade. The New England merchants who evaded the embargo were imaginative, daring, and versatile in their violation of federal law. Gordinier (2001) examines how the merchants of New London, Connecticut, organized and managed the cargoes purchased and sold and the vessels that were used during the years before, during, and after the embargo. Trade routes and cargoes, both foreign and domestic, along with the vessel types, and the ways that their ownership and management were organized show the merchants of southeastern Connecticut evinced versatility in the face of crisis. Gordinier (2001) concludes that the versatile merchants sought alternative strategies for their commerce and, to a lesser extent, for their navigation. They tried extralegal activities, a reduction in the size of the foreign fleet, and the redocumentation of foreign trading vessels into domestic carriage. Most importantly, they sought new domestic trading partners and took advantage of the political power of Jedidiah Huntington, the Customs Collector. Huntington was an influential member of the Connecticut leadership class (called \\"the Standing Order\\") and allowed scores of embargoed vessels to depart for foreign ports under the guise of \\"special permission.\\" Old modes of sharing vessel ownership to share the risk proved to be difficult to modify. Instead, established relationships continued through the embargo crisis despite of numerous bankruptcies. Enforcement efforts Jefferson's Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, was against the entire embargo and foresaw correctly the impossibility of enforcing the policy and the negative public reaction. \\"As to the hope that it may... induce England to treat us better,\\" wrote Gallatin to Jefferson shortly after the bill had become law, \\"I think is entirely groundless... government prohibitions do always more mischief than had been calculated; and it is not without much hesitation that a statesman should hazard to regulate the concerns of individuals as if he could do it better than themselves.\\" Since the bill hindered US ships from leaving American ports bound for foreign trade, it had the side effect of hindering American exploration. First supplementary act Just weeks later, on January 8, 1808, legislation again passed the 10th Congress, Session 1; Chapter 8: \\"An Act supplementary...\\" to the Embargo Act (2 Stat. 453). As the historian Forrest McDonald wrote, \\"A loophole had been discovered\\" in the initial enactment, \\"namely that coasting vessels, and fishing and whaling boats\\" had been exempt from the embargo, and they had been circumventing it, primarily via Canada. The supplementary act extended the bonding provision (Section 2 of the initial Embargo Act) to those of purely-domestic trades:2 Stat. 453 (1808) Library of Congress, U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774‚Äì1875 * Sections 1 and 2 of the supplementary act required bonding to coasting, fishing, and whaling ships and vessels. Even river boats had to post a bond. * Section 3 made violations of either the initial or supplementary act an offense. Failure of the shipowner to comply would result in forfeiture of the ship and its cargo or a fine of double that value and the denial of credit for use in custom duties. A captain failing to comply would be fined between one and twenty thousand dollars and would forfeit the ability to swear an oath before any customs officer. * Section 4 removed the warship exemption from applying to privateers or vessels with a letter of marque. * Section 5 established a fine for foreign ships loading merchandise for export and allowed for its seizure. Meanwhile, Jefferson requested authorization from Congress to raise 30,000 troops from the current standing army of 2,800, but Congress refused. With their harbors for the most part unusable in the winter anyway, New England and the northern ports of the mid-Atlantic states had paid little notice to the previous embargo acts. That was to change with the spring thaw and the passing of yet another embargo act. With the coming of the spring, the effect of the previous acts were immediately felt throughout the coastal states, especially in New England. An economic downturn turned into a depression and caused increasing unemployment. Protests occurred up and down the eastern coast. Most merchants and shippers simply ignored the laws. On the Canada‚ÄìUS border, especially in Upstate New York and in Vermont, the embargo laws were openly flouted. Federal officials believed parts of Maine, such as Passamaquoddy Bay on the border with British-held New Brunswick, were in open rebellion. By March, an increasingly-frustrated Jefferson had become resolved to enforce the embargo to the letter. Other supplements to Act On March 12, 1808, Congress passed and Jefferson signed into law yet another supplement to the Embargo Act. It prohibited for the first time all exports of any goods, whether by land or by sea. Violators were subject to a fine of $10,000, plus forfeiture of goods, per offense. It granted the President broad discretionary authority to enforce, deny, or grant exceptions to the embargo. Port authorities were authorized to seize cargoes without a warrant and to try any shipper or merchant who was thought to have merely contemplated violating the embargo. Despite the added penalties, citizens and shippers openly ignored the embargo. Protests continued to grow and so the Jefferson administration requested and Congress rendered yet another embargo act. Consequences snapping turtle named \\"Ograbme\\" (\\"Embargo\\" spelled backwards). The embargo was also ridiculed in the New England press as Dambargo, Mob-Rage, or Go- bar-'em. The embargo hurt the US as much as Britain or France. Britain, expecting to suffer most from the American regulations, built up a new South American market for its exports, and the British shipowners were pleased that American competition had been removed by the action of the US government. Jefferson placed himself in a strange position with his embargo policy. Though he had so frequently and eloquently argued for as little government intervention as possible, he now found himself assuming extraordinary powers in an attempt to enforce his policy. The presidential election of 1808 had James Madison defeat Charles Cotesworth Pinckney but showed that the Federalists were regaining strength and helped to convince Jefferson and Madison that the embargo would have to be removed. Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the failed Embargo. Despite its unpopular nature, the Embargo Act had some limited unintended benefits, especially as entrepreneurs and workers responded by bringing in fresh capital and labor to New England textile and other manufacturing industries, which lessened America's reliance on the British merchants. Repeal On March 1, 1809, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act. The law enabled the President, once the wars of Europe had ended, to declare the country sufficiently safe and to allow foreign trade with certain nations. In 1810, the government was ready to try yet another tactic of economic coercion, the desperate measure known as Macon's Bill Number 2. The bill became law on May 1, 1810 and replaced the Non-Intercourse Act. It was an acknowledgment of the failure of economic pressure to coerce the European powers. Trade with both Britain and France was now thrown open, and the US attempted to bargain with the two belligerents. If either power removed its restrictions on American commerce, the US would reapply non-intercourse against the power that had not done so. Napoleon quickly took advantage of that opportunity. He promised that his Berlin and Milan Decrees would be repealed, and Madison reinstated non-intercourse against Britain in the fall of 1810. Though Napoleon did not fulfill his promise, the strained Anglo-American relations prevented him from being brought to task for his duplicity. The attempts of Jefferson and Madison to resist aggression by peaceful means gained a belated success in June 1812, when Britain finally promised to repeal their Orders in Council. The British concession was too late since when the news had reached America, the US had already declared the War of 1812 against Britain. Wartime legislation America's declaration of war in mid-June 1812 was followed shortly by the Enemy Trade Act of 1812 on July 6, which employed similar restrictions as previous legislation. it was likewise ineffective and tightened in December 1813 and debated for further tightening in December 1814. After existing embargoes expired with the onset of war, the Embargo Act of 1813 was signed into law December 17, 1813. Four new restrictions were included: an embargo prohibiting all American ships and goods from leaving port, a complete ban on certain commodities customarily produced in the British Empire, a ban against foreign ships trading in American ports unless 75% of the crew were citizens of the ship's flag, and a ban on ransoming ships. The Embargo of 1813 was the nation's last great trade restriction. Never again would the US government cut off all trade to achieve a foreign policy objective. The Act particularly hurt the Northeast since the British kept a tighter blockade on the South and thus encouraged American opposition to the administration. To make his point, the Act was not lifted by Madison until after the defeat of Napoleon, and the point was moot. On February 15, 1815, Madison signed the Enemy Trade Act of 1815, which was tighter than any previous trade restriction including the Enforcement Act of 1809 (January 9) and the Embargo of 1813, but it would expire two weeks later when official word of peace from Ghent was received.

It took effect on January 1, 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution. This legislation was promoted by President Thomas Jefferson, who called for its enactment in his 1806 State of the Union Address. He had promoted the idea since the 1770s. It reflected the force of the general trend toward abolishing the international slave trade which Virginia, followed by all the other states, had prohibited or restricted since then. South Carolina, however, had reopened its trade. Congress first regulated against the trade in the Slave Trade Act of 1794. The 1794 Act ended the legality of American ships participating in the trade. The 1807 law did not change that‚Äîit made all importation from abroad, even on foreign ships, a federal crime. The domestic slave trade within the U.S. was not affected by the 1807 law. Indeed, with the legal supply of imported slaves terminated, the domestic trade increased in importance. In addition, some smuggling of slaves persisted. Background The laws here affected only the import or export of slaves. They did not affect the internal trade in states or between states. During the American Revolution all states prohibited the international trade, but three states later reopened it, at least for a time. Article 1 Section 9 of the United States Constitution protected a state's international slave-import trading for twenty years from federal prohibition. Article 5 said this clause could not be affected by constitutional amendment. Only starting January 1, 1808, could there be a federal law to abolish the international slave trade in all states, although individual states could and did ban it at any time. > The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now > existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the > Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a tax > or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for > each Person.U.S. Constitution ‚Äì Article 1 Section 9 In the 18th century, Great Britain had become Europe's largest slave trader. During the American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783) against Great Britain, all the states banned the Atlantic slave trade. This was done for a variety of economic, political, and moral reasons depending on the state. After the close of the Revolution in 1783, South Carolina reopened its international trade until prohibiting it again in 1787, but then reopened it in 1803; while North Carolina allowed the trade beginning after the Revolution, until abolishing its international trade in 1794; and Georgia allowed the trade between 1783, until it closed its international trade in 1798. By 1807, only South Carolina allowed the international slave trade. On March 22, 1794, Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited making, loading, outfitting, equipping, or dispatching of any ship to be used in the trade of slaves, essentially limiting the trade to foreign ships.Timeline: The Atlantic Slave Trade On August 5, 1797, John Brown of Providence, Rhode Island, became the first American to be tried in federal court under the 1794 law. Brown was convicted and was forced to forfeit his ship .Papers of the American Slave Trade In the 1798 act creating the Mississippi Territory, Congress allowed slaves to be imported from the rest of the United States to Mississippi Territory, and exempted the territory from the part of the 1787 Northwest Ordinance that abolished slavery in the Northwest Territory (modern-day Midwest) after 1800. However, the same act also abolished the importation of slaves to the Mississippi Territory from \\"foreign parts\\" (foreign nations).Arthur Scherr, John Adams, Slavery, and Race: Ideas, Politics, and Diplomacy in an Age of Crisis (ABC-CLIO, 2017), p. 198. The penalty for illegally importing slaves from abroad to the territory was a fine of $300. In the Slave Trade Act of 1800, Congress outlawed U.S. citizens' investment in the trade, and the employment of U.S. citizens on foreign vessels involved in the trade. Passage of the Act On December 2, 1806, in his annual message to Congress, widely reprinted in most newspapers, President Thomas Jefferson denounced the \\"violations of human rights\\" attending the international slave trade and called for its criminalization on the first day that was possible (January 1, 1808). He said: The House and Senate agreed on a bill, approved on March 2, 1807, called An Act to prohibit the importation of slaves into any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States, from and after the first day of January, in the year of our Lord, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eight. The bound measure also regulated the coastwise slave trade. President Thomas Jefferson signed the bill into law on March 2, 1807. Many in Congress believed the act would doom slavery in the South, but they were mistaken.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery (1993) p 80 The role of the Navy was expanded to include patrols off the coasts of Cuba and South America. The effective date of the Act, January 1, 1808, was celebrated by Peter Williams, Jr., in \\"An Oration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade\\" delivered in New York City.Pater Williams, Jr., An Oration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade; Delivered in the African Church in the City of New-York, January 1, 1808, Paul Royster, Ed., online pdf version, Digital Commons, University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln, accessed 31 May 2012 Effectiveness and prosecutions for slaving While there are no exact figures known, historians estimate that up to 50,000 slaves were illegally imported into the United States after 1808, mostly through Spanish Florida and Texas, before those states were admitted to the Union.Randy J. Sparks, Africans in the Old South: Mapping Exceptional Lives Across the Atlantic World (Harvard University Press, 2016), p. 80. However, South Carolina Governor Henry Middleton estimated in 1819 that 13,000 smuggled African slaves arrived every year. Carl C. Cutler's classic book on American clipper ships records: > The act outlawing the slave trade in 1808 furnished another source of demand > for fast vessels, and for another half century ships continued to be fitted > out and financed in this trade by many a respectable citizen in the majority > of American ports. Newspapers of the fifties contain occasional references > to the number of ships sailing from the various cities in this traffic. One > account stated that as late as 1859 there were seven slavers regularly > fitted out in New York, and many more in all the larger ports. In 1820, slave-trading became a capital offense with an amendment to the 1819 Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy. A total of 74 cases of slaving were brought in the United States between 1837 and 1860, \\"but few captains had been convicted, and those had retrieved trifling sentences, which they had usually been able to avoid\\".Hugh Thomas, The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade: 1440‚Äì1870 (Simon & Schuster, 1997), p. 774. Nathaniel Gordon, who was hanged in 1862, was the only person to be executed for illegal slave-trading in the United States. In addition, after the 1808 abolition of the slave trade to the United States, many Americans continued to engage in the slave trade by transporting Africans to Cuba. From 1808 to 1860, almost one-third of all slave ships were either owned by American merchants, or were built and outfitted in American ports.Matt D. Childs, \\"Cuba, the Atlantic Crisis of the 1860s, and the Road to Abolition\\" in American Civil Wars: The United States, Latin America, Europe, and the Crisis of the 1860s (ed. Don H. Doyle: University of North Carolina Press, 2017). It is possible that U.S. citizens \\"may have transported twice as many Africans to other countries such as Cuba and Brazil as they did to their own ports\\". Antebellum proposals by Fire-Eaters to reopen In the South, the Fire-Eaters‚Äîantebellum pro-slavery extremists‚Äîproposed repealing the act and once more legalizing the international slave trade in the United States. Historian Erskine Clarke writes that this call \\"was a shameless expression of their contempt for any antislavery sentiment and a part of their stratagem to divide the nation and create a slaveholding confederacy. Among other things, the Fire-Eaters hoped that a reopened international slave trade would incense the North, and that Northern outrage would cause white Southerns to unite and move toward secession.\\"Erskine Clarke, By the Rivers of Water: A Nineteenth- Century Atlantic Odyssey (Basic Books, 2013), p. 324. In addition to whipping up sectional tensions, Fire-Eaters advocated the reopening of the slave trade in order to drive down the price of slaves; to balance the millions of European immigrants who had settled in the North and maintain Southern representation in Congress; and assert the morality of slavery: \\"Slave trading had to be made right, otherwise slavery was imperiled.\\"Erik Calonius, The Wanderer: The Last American Slave Ship and the Conspiracy That Set Its Sails (St. Martin's Griffin, 2006), pp. 43‚Äì43. Fire-Eaters essentially desired to \\"legitimize the slave trade in order to make the point that both slavery and the African slave trade were morally acceptable practices\\"‚Äîa view intended to be precisely opposite that of the abolitionists, who affirmed the immorality of both slavery and the slave trade. The view alarmed even pro-slavery figures, such as former President John Tyler, who in retirement wrote a widely republished letter condemning the Fire-Eaters' call to abrogate article 8 of the Webster‚ÄìAshburton Treaty (which barred the slave trade). Tyler noted that the South had voted to ratify the treaty.Edward P. Crapol, John Tyler, the Accidental President (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), pp. 247‚Äì48.

This Act lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. Its intent was to damage the economies of the United Kingdom and France. Like its predecessor, the Embargo Act, it was mostly ineffective, and contributed to the coming of the War of 1812. In addition, it seriously damaged the economy of the United States.United States Non-Intercourse Act - March 1, 1809 Rockcastle Karst Conservancy The Non-Intercourse Act was followed by Macon's Bill Number 2. Despite hurting the economy as a whole, the bill did help America begin to industrialize, as no British manufactured goods could be imported, so these goods instead had to be produced domestically.

This was a revision of the original bill by Representative Nathaniel Macon, known as Macon's Bill Number 1. Macon's Bill Number 2 was the fourth in a series of ineffective, counterproductive laws, the Non-Importation Act, the Embargo Act, and the Non-Intercourse Act (1809). Macon neither wrote the bill nor approved it. The law lifted all embargoes with Britain and France for three months. It stated that if either belligerent ceased disrupting American shipping, the United States would embargo the other, unless that other country also agreed to cease disrupting American shipping. Napoleon successfully exploited the bill to further his Continental System, effectively a French embargo on Britain that France tried to enforce on continental Europe, and to damage British-American relations. A message was sent to the United States, purporting to agree to the law's demand. President James Madison, a staunch opponent of the bill, had little choice but to accept Napoleon's ostensibly sincere offer. However, as Madison suspected, Napoleon's purpose was manipulative. When Britain threatened force against the United States in response, Napoleon reneged anyway, having achieved his goal of pushing the United States and Britain closer to the eventual War of 1812.

The central bank's reaction to the crisis‚Äîa clumsy expansion, then a sharp contraction of credit‚Äîindicated its weakness, not its strength.Dangerfield, 1966, pp. 85‚Äì86 The effects were catastrophic, resulting in a protracted recession with mass unemployment and a sharp drop in property values that persisted until 1822.Wilentz, 2008, pp. 207‚Äì208 The financial crisis raised doubts among the American public as to the efficacy of paper money, and in whose interests a national system of finance operated.Dangerfield, 1966, p. 89 Upon this widespread disaffection the anti-bank Jacksonian Democrats would mobilize opposition to the BUS in the 1830s. The national bank was in general disrepute among most Americans when Nicholas Biddle, the third and last president of the bank, was appointed by President James Monroe in 1823.Hammond, 1947, p. 151 Under Biddle's guidance, the BUS evolved into a powerful banking institution that produced a strong and sound system of national credit and currency.Remini, 1981, p. 229 From 1823 to 1833, Biddle expanded credit steadily, but with restraint, in a manner that served the needs of the expanding American economy.Hofstadter, 1948, p. 62 Albert Gallatin, former Secretary of the Treasury under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, wrote in 1831 that the BUS was fulfilling its charter expectations.Hammond, 1947, p.150  Jackson's Bank War  By the time of Jackson's inauguration in 1829, the national bank appeared to be on solid footing. The U.S. Supreme Court had affirmed the constitutionality of the bank under McCulloch v. Maryland, the 1819 case which Daniel Webster had argued successfully on its behalf a decade earlier,Killenbeck, 2006, pp. 98‚Äì109 the U.S. Treasury recognized the useful services it provided, and the American currency was healthy and stable.Hammon, 1947, p. 151 Public perceptions of the central bank were generally positive.Hammond, 1957, p. 371Schlesinger, 1945, p. 77 The bank first came under attack by the Jackson administration in December 1829, on the grounds that it had failed to produce a stable national currency, and that it lacked constitutional legitimacy.Wilentz, 2008, p. 362Hammond, 1947, pp. 151‚Äì152Remini, 1981, pp. 228‚Äì229, 303 Both houses of Congress responded with committee investigations and reports affirming the historical precedents for the bank's constitutionality and its pivotal role in furnishing a uniform currency.Hammond, 1957, pp. 377‚Äì378 Jackson rejected these findings, and privately characterized the bank as a corrupt institution, dangerous to American liberties.Hammond, 1957, p. 379 A Democratic cartoon from 1833 showing Jackson destroying the bank with his \\"Order for the Removal,\\" to the approval of the Uncle Sam like figure to the right, and the annoyance of the bank's president, shown as the Devil himself. Numerous politicians and editors who were given favorable loans from the bank run for cover as the financial temple crashes down. Biddle made repeated overtures to Jackson and his cabinet to secure a compromise on the bank's rechartering (its term due to expire in 1836) without success.Hofstadter, 1948, pp. 59‚Äì60Schlesinger, 1945, p. 81 Jackson and the anti-bank forces persisted in their condemnation of the BUS,Remini, 1981, pp. 301‚Äì302 provoking an early recharter campaign by pro- bank National Republicans under Henry Clay.Remini, 1981, pp. 341‚Äì342Hammond, 1957, p. 385 Clay's political ultimatum to JacksonRemini, 1981, p. 365‚Äîwith Biddle's financial and political supportWilentz, 2005, p. 369Remini, 1981, p. 343‚Äîsparked the Bank WarSchlesinger, 1945, p. 87Remini, 1981, p. 361 and placed the fate of the BUS at center of the 1832 presidential election.Remini, 1981, p. 374 Jackson mobilized his political baseSchlesinger, 1945, p. 91 by vetoing the recharter billSchlesinger, 1945, p.87 and, the veto sustained,Wellman, 1966, p. 132 easily won reelection on his anti-bank platform.Remini, 1981, pp. 382‚Äì383, 389 Jackson proceeded to destroy the bank as a financial and political force by removing its federal deposits,Remini, 1981, pp. 375‚Äì376Wilentz, 2008, pp. 392‚Äì393Schlesinger, 1945, p. 98 and in 1833, federal revenue was diverted into selected private banks by executive order, ending the regulatory role of the Second Bank of the United States.See Andrew Jackson's State of the Union Addresses 1829‚Äì1836 Gutenberg In hopes of extorting a rescue of the bank, Biddle induced a short-lived financial crisisHofstadter, 1948, pp. 61‚Äì62 that was initially blamed on Jackson's executive action.Wilentz, 2008, p. 396Schlesinger, 1945, p. 103 By 1834, a general backlash against Biddle's tactics developed, ending the panicWilentz, 2008, p. 400Schlesinger, 1945, p. 112‚Äì113 and all recharter efforts were abandoned. State bank In February 1836, the bank became a private corporation under the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania law. A shortage of hard currency ensued, causing the Panic of 1837 and lasting approximately seven years. The Bank suspended payment in 1839 and was liquidated in 1841.

Whereas other central banks of that era were wholly private, the BUS was more characteristic of a government bank.Hammond, 1947, p. 140 Under its charter, the bank had a capital limit of $35 million, $7.5 million of which represented the government-owned share. The central bank was required to remit a \\"bonus\\" payment of $1.5 million, payable in three installments, to the government for the privilege of using the public funds, interest free, in its private banking ventures.Wilentz, 2008, p. 364 The institution was answerable for its performance to the U.S. Treasury and CongressHammond, 1947, p. 149 and subject to Treasury Department inspection. As exclusive fiscal agent for the federal government,Wellman, 1966, p. 92, Hammond, 1947, p. 149 it provided a number of services as part of its charter including: holding and transfer of all U.S. deposits, payment and receipt of all government transactions, and processing of tax payments.Wilentz, 2005, p. 365 In other words, the BUS was \\"the depository of the federal government, which was its principal stockholder and customer\\".Hammond, 1947, p. 149, Hammond, 1957, p. 9 The chief personnel for the bank comprised twenty-five directors, five of whom were appointed by the President of the United States, subject to Senate approval. Federally appointed directors were barred from acting as officials in other banks. Two of the three BUS presidents, William Jones and Nicholas Biddle, were chosen from among these government directors. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the bank was authorized to establish branch offices where it deemed suitable and these were immune from state taxation. BUS regulatory mechanisms The primary regulatory task of the Second Bank of the United States, as chartered by Congress in 1816, was to restrain the uninhibited proliferation of paper money (bank notes) by state or private lenders, which was highly profitable to these institutions.Wilentz, 2008, pp. 74‚Äì75 In this capacity, the bank would preside over this democratization of credit,Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56 contributing to a vast and profitable disbursement of bank loans to farmers, small manufacturers and entrepreneurs, encouraging rapid and healthy economic expansion. Historian Bray Hammond describes the mechanism by which the Bank exerted its anti-inflationary influence: Under this banking regime, the impulse towards over speculation, with the risks of creating a national financial crisis, would be avoided, or at least mitigated.Hammond, 1947, p. 149-150, Wilentz, 2008, p. 205, Hofstadter, 1948, p. 56 It was just this mechanism that the local private banks found objectionable, because it yoked their lending strategies to the fiscal operations of the national government, requiring them to maintain adequate gold and silver reserves to meet their debt obligations to the U.S. Treasury. The proliferation of private-sector banking institutions ‚Äì from 31 banks in 1801 to 788 in 1837Hammond, 1947, p. 153 ‚Äì meant that the Second Bank faced strong opposition from this sector during the Jackson administration. Architecture The building in a book published in 1875 The architect of the Second Bank of the United States was William Strickland (1788‚Äì1854), a former student of Benjamin Latrobe (1764‚Äì1820), the man who is often called the first professionally trained American architect. Latrobe and Strickland were both disciples of the Greek Revival style. Strickland went on to design many other American public buildings in this style, including financial structures such as the Mechanics National Bank (also in Philadelphia). He also designed the New Orleans, Dahlonega, and Charlotte branch mints in the mid-to-late 1830s, as well as the second building for the main U.S. Mint in Philadelphia in 1833. Strickland's design for the Second Bank of the United States is in essence based on the Parthenon in Athens, Greece, and is a significant early and monumental example of Greek Revival architecture. The hallmarks of the Greek Revival style can be seen immediately in the north and south fa√ßades, which use a large set of steps leading up to the main level platform, known as the stylobate. On top of these, Strickland placed eight severe Doric columns, which are crowned by an entablature containing a triglyph frieze and simple triangular pediment. The building appears much as an ancient Greek temple, hence the stylistic name. The interior consists of an entrance hallway in the center of the north fa√ßade flanked by two rooms on either side. The entry leads into two central rooms, one after the other, that span the width of the structure east to west. The east and west sides of the first large room are each pierced by large arched fan window. The building's exterior uses Pennsylvania blue marble, which, due to the manner in which it was cut, has begun to deteriorate due to weak parts of the stone being exposed to the elements. This phenomenon is most visible on the Doric columns of the south fa√ßade. Construction lasted from 1819 to 1824. The Greek Revival style used for the Second Bank contrasts with the earlier, Federal style in architecture used for the First Bank of the United States, which also still stands and is located nearby in Philadelphia. This can be seen in the more Roman-influenced Federal structure's ornate, colossal Corinthian columns of its fa√ßade, which is also embellished by Corinthian pilasters and a symmetric arrangement of sash windows piercing the two stories of the fa√ßade. The roofline is also topped by a balustrade and the heavy modillions adorning the pediment give the First Bank an appearance much more like a Roman villa than a Greek temple. Current building use Since the bank's closing in 1841, the edifice has performed a variety of functions. Today, it is part of Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. The structure is open to the public free of charge and serves as an art gallery, housing a large collection of portraits of prominent early Americans painted by Charles Willson Peale and many others. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 for its architectural and historic significance. The Wall Street branch in New York City was converted into the United States Assay Office before it was demolished in 1915. The federal-style fa√ßade was saved and installed in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1924.  In popular culture  The Bank of the United States building was described by Charles Dickens in a chapter of his 1842 travelogue American Notes for General Circulation, Philadelphia, and its solitary prison: > We reached the city, late that night. Looking out of my chamber-window, > before going to bed, I saw, on the opposite side of the way, a handsome > building of white marble, which had a mournful ghost-like aspect, dreary to > behold. I attributed this to the sombre influence of the night, and on > rising in the morning looked out again, expecting to see its steps and > portico thronged with groups of people passing in and out. The door was > still tight shut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed: and the > building looked as if the marble statue of Don Guzman could alone have any > business to transact within its gloomy walls. I hastened to inquire its name > and purpose, and then my surprise vanished. It was the Tomb of many > fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; the memorable United States > Bank. > The stoppage of this bank, with all its ruinous consequences, had cast (as I > was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under the depressing effect > of which it yet laboured. It certainly did seem rather dull and out of > spirits.

It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto central bank. Establishment of the Bank of the United States was part of a three-part expansion of federal fiscal and monetary power, along with a federal mint and excise taxes, championed by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. Hamilton believed a national bank was necessary to stabilize and improve the nation's credit, and to improve handling of the financial business of the United States government under the newly enacted Constitution. The First Bank building, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within Independence National Historical Park, was completed in 1797, and is a National Historic Landmark for its historic and architectural significance. Background In 1791, the Bank of the United States was one of the three major financial innovations proposed and supported by Alexander Hamilton, first Secretary of the Treasury. In addition to the national bank, the other measures were an assumption of the state war debts by the U.S. government, establishment of a mint and imposition of a federal excise tax. The goals of Hamilton's three measures were to: * Establish financial order, clarity, and precedence in and of the newly formed United States. * Establish credit‚Äîboth in a country and overseas‚Äîfor the new nation. *Resolve the issue of the fiat currency, issued by the Continental Congress immediately prior to and during the American Revolutionary War‚Äîthe \\"Continental\\". In simpler words, Hamilton's four goals were to: * Have the Federal Government assume the Revolutionary War debts of the several states * Pay off the war debts * Raise money for the new government * Establish a national bank and create a common currency Proposal According to the plan put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton proposed establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government purchase the stock using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would be available to the public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter of the purchase price had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.The First Bank of the United States: A Chapter in the History of Central Banking Unlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be to issue credit to the government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business would be involved in on behalf of the federal government‚Äîa depository for collected taxes, making short-term loans to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monies‚Äîwas considered highly important but still secondary in nature. There were other, non-negotiable conditions for the establishment of the First Bank of the United States. Among these were: * That the bank would have a twenty-year charter running from 1791 to 1811, after which time it would be up to the Congress to approve or deny renewal of the bank and its charter; however, during that time no other federal bank would be authorized; states, for their part, would be free to charter however many intrastate banks they wished. *That the bank, to avoid any appearance of impropriety, would: *#be forbidden to buy a government bond. *#have a mandatory rotation of directors. *#neither issue notes nor incur debts beyond its actual capitalization. * That foreigners, whether overseas or residing in the United States, would be allowed to be First Bank of the United States stockholders, but would not be allowed to vote. *That the Secretary of the Treasury would be free to remove government deposits, inspect the books, and require statements regarding the bank's condition as frequently as once a week.Report on the Bank, in Syrett, ed., Papers, 7:326‚Äì28 To ensure that the government could meet both the current and future demands of its governmental accounts, an additional source of funding was required, \\"for interest payments on the assumed state debts would begin to fall due at the end of 1791...those payments would require $788,333 annually, and... an additional $38,291 was needed to cover deficiencies in the funds that had been appropriated for existing commitments.\\"Further Report on Public Credit, 7:226 To achieve this, Hamilton repeated a suggestion he had made nearly a year before‚Äîincrease the duty on imported spirits, plus raise the excise tax on domestically distilled whiskey and other liquors. Local opposition to the tax led to the Whiskey Rebellion. Opposition Hamilton's bank proposal faced widespread resistance from opponents of increased federal power. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and James Madison led the opposition, which claimed that the bank was unconstitutional, and that it benefited merchants and investors at the expense of the majority of the population. Like most of the Southern members of Congress, Jefferson and Madison also opposed a second of the three proposals of Hamilton: establishing an official government Mint. They believed this centralization of power away from local banks was dangerous to a sound monetary system and was mostly to the benefit of business interests in the commercial north, not southern agricultural interests, arguing that the right to own property would be infringed by these proposals. Furthermore, they contended that the creation of such a bank violated the Constitution, which specifically stated that Congress was to regulate weights and measures and issue coined money (rather than mint and bills of credit). Bank of the United States check signed by John Jacob Astor in 1792 The first part of the bill, the concept, and establishment of a national mint, met with no real objection, and sailed through; it was assumed the second and third part (the bank and an excise tax to finance it) would likewise glide through, and in their own way they did: The House version of the bill, despite some heated objections, easily passed. The Senate version of the bill did likewise, with considerably fewer, and milder, objections. It was when \\"the two bills changed houses, complications set in. In the Senate, Hamilton's supporters objected to the House's alteration of the plans for the excise tax.\\" The establishment of the bank also raised early questions of constitutionality in the new government. Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, argued that the bank was an effective means to utilize the authorized powers of the government implied under the law of the Constitution. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson argued that the bank violated traditional property laws and that its relevance to constitutionally authorized powers was weak. Another argument came from James Madison, who believed Congress had not received the power to incorporate a bank or any other governmental agency. His argument rested primarily on the Tenth Amendment: that all powers not endowed to Congress are retained by the States (or the people). Additionally, his belief was that if the Constitution's writers had wanted Congress to have such power, they would have made it explicit. The decision would ultimately fall on President George Washington, following his deliberate investigation of the cabinet members' opinions.John Marshall, The Life of George Washington, (1838) Chapter 28: Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs ‚Äì and the First \\"Systematic Opposition\\" (1790 to 1791) Presidential approval George Washington initially declared that he was hesitant to sign the \\"bank bill\\" into law. Washington asked for the written advice and supporting reasons from all his cabinet members‚Äîmost particularly from Hamilton. Attorney General Edmund Randolph from Virginia felt that the bill was unconstitutional. Jefferson, also from Virginia, agreed that Hamilton's proposal was against both the spirit and letter of the Constitution. Hamilton, who, unlike his fellow cabinet members, came from New York, quickly responded to those who claimed incorporation of the bank unconstitutional. While Hamilton's rebuttals were many and varied, chief among them were these two: *What the government could do for a person (incorporate), it could not refuse to do for an \\"artificial person\\", a business. And the First Bank of the United States is privately owned and not a government agency, was a business. \\"Thus...unquestionably incident to sovereign power to erect corporations to that of the United States, in relation to the objects entrusted to the management of the government.\\" *Any government by its very nature was sovereign \\"and includes by force of the term a right to attainment of the ends...which are not precluded by restrictions & exceptions specified in the constitution...Washington to Hamilton, February 16, 1791, in Syrett, ed. Papers 8:98 On February 25, 1791, convinced that the constitution authorized the measure, Washington signed the \\"bank bill\\" into law. On March 19, 1791 Washington appointed three Commissioners for the taking of subscriptions for this new bank: Thomas Willing, David Rittenhouse, and Samuel Howell. Willing was later elected as President on October 25, 1791, until he resigned due to ill health on November 10, 1807. He was succeeded by David Lenox, serving until the expiration of its charter on March 4, 1811. Expiration of charter After Hamilton left office in 1795, the new Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. informed Congress that, due to the existing state of government finances, more money was needed. This could be achieved either by selling the government's shares of stock in the bank or by raising taxes. Wolcott advised the first choice. Congress quickly agreed. Hamilton objected, believing that the dividends on that stock had been inviolably pledged for the support of the sinking fund to retire the debt. Hamilton tried to organize opposition to the measure but was unsuccessful. In 1811, the U.S. Senate tied on a vote to renew the bank's charter. Vice President George Clinton broke the tie and voted against renewal. The bank's charter thus expired in 1811. In 1816, the bank was succeeded by the Second Bank of the United States. Purchase by Girard After the charter for the First Bank of the United States expired in 1811, Stephen Girard purchased most of its stock as well as the building and its furnishings on South Third Street in Philadelphia and opened his own bank, later known as Girard Bank. Girard hired George Simpson, the cashier of the First Bank of the United States, as cashier of the new bank, and with seven other employees, opened for business on May 18, 1812. He allowed the Trustees of the First Bank of the United States to use some offices and space in the vaults to continue the process of winding down the affairs of the closed bank at a very nominal rent. Over its early history the bank was known as \\"Girard's Bank,\\" or as \\"Girard Bank\\" or also as \\"Stephen Girard's Bank\\" or even the \\"Bank of Stephen Girard.\\" Girard was the sole proprietor of his bank, and thus avoided the Pennsylvania state law which prohibited an unincorporated association of persons from establishing a bank, and which required a charter from the legislature for a banking corporation. Bank building Measured drawing of the First Bank from the Historic American Buildings Survey. The First Bank of the United States was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, while the city served as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800. The bank began operations in Carpenters' Hall in 1791, some 200 feet from its permanent home. Design of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC.,1984 National Register Nomination although it has also been attributed to James Hoban. It was completed in 1795.NPS historical marker at building The First Bank of the United States has received various designations as a historic building. It was included in Independence National Historical Park when the park was formed in 1956. The building's architecture was studied by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1958. With the rest of Independence National Historical Park, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966, and the bank was then declared a National Historic Landmark on May 4, 1987. It is described in the landmark designation as an early masterpiece of monumental Classical Revival design. Until about 2000, the building housed offices for Independence National Historical Park. A proposal to have it house the collection of the Philadelphia Civil War Museum was abandoned when funding from the state of Pennsylvania was not forthcoming.Philadelphia Civil War Museum Future plans for the building are to house the National Park Service archaeology lab which is currently located across the street.

Chartered by the Continental Congress on May 26, 1781, and opened in Philadelphia on January 7, 1782, it was based upon a plan presented by US Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris on May 17, 1781, based on recommendations by Revolutionary era figure Alexander Hamilton. Failing to gain and maintain sufficient long term traction in that role, it was succeeded by the also privately held First Bank of the United States in 1791. History Congressional charter Benjamin Franklin Bache on marbled paper obtained by Benjamin Franklin. In May 1781 Alexander Hamilton revealed that he had recommended Robert Morris for the position of Superintendent of Finance of the United States the previous summer when the constitution of the Articles of Confederation-era executive was being solidified. Second, he proceeded to lay out a proposal for a national bank that would also serve as a de facto central bank. Morris, who had corresponded with Hamilton previously on the subject of funding the war, immediately drafted a legislative proposal based on Hamilton's suggestion and submitted it to the Congress. Morris persuaded Congress to charter the Bank of North America, the first private commercial bank in the United States. Stock offering The original charter as outlined by Hamilton called for the disbursement of 1,000 shares priced at $400 each. Benjamin Franklin purchased a single token share as a sign of good faith to Federalists and their new bank. Hamilton used his pseudonym \\"Publius\\" (later immortalized in the Federalist Papers advocating in the late 1780s for adoption of the United States Constitution) to endorse the bank. William Bingham, rumored to be the richest man in America after the Revolutionary War, purchased 9.5% of the available shares. The greatest share, however, 63.3%, was purchased on behalf of the United States government by Robert Morris using a gift in the form of a loan from France, and a loan from the Netherlands. This had the effect of capitalizing the bank with large deposits of gold and silver coin and bills of exchange. He then issued new paper currency backed by this supply. Officers Thomas Willing, a twice former mayor of Philadelphia and partner with Morris in an import-export firm (that included slaving), was named the bank's first president. He held that office from 1781‚Äì1791, being succeeded by John Nixon, and moving immediately on to become the first president of the First Bank of the United States, a position he held from 1791 to 1807. Bank certificates By 1783, Congress and several states including Massachusetts enacted legislation, allowing Americans to pay taxes with Bank of North America certificates, giving them a crucial aspect of legal tender. New York Stock Exchange Demolishing the Bank of North America's building at 305‚Äì307 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia (1959 or later) The Bank of North America along with the First Bank of the United States and the Bank of New York were the first shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

The United States Force Bill, formally titled \\"An Act further to provide for the collection of duties on imports\\", (1833), refers to legislation enacted by the 22nd U.S. Congress on March 2, 1833, during the Nullification Crisis. Passed by Congress at the urging of President Andrew Jackson, the Force Bill consisted of eight sections expanding presidential power and was designed to compel the state of South Carolina's compliance with a series of federal tariffs, opposed by John C. Calhoun and other leading South Carolinians. Among other things, the legislation stipulated that the president could, if he deemed it necessary, deploy the U.S. Army to force South Carolina to comply with the law. The relevant sections of the Force Bill are:Text of the Force Bill, Wikisource * Section 1 deals with unlawful obstructions to the collections of import duties; by securing ports and harbors for the protection of duty collectors, allowing for the detention of vessels and cargoes to enforce revenue laws, and authorizes the president to use armed forces to protect customs officers and to prevent the unauthorized removal of untaxed vessels and cargo. * Section 2 expands the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases arising from revenue collections by the U.S. government and allows injured parties in revenue cases to sue in court. It deems property detained by customs officers to be in the custody of the law, subject to disposition by court order only, and criminalizes anyone who circumvents the legal process in regaining detained property as guilty of a misdemeanor. * Section 5 deals with States, or portions within a state, who employ force, or any other unlawful means, to obstruct the execution of U.S. federal law, or interfere with the process of any federal court. This section authorizes the president to use whatever force necessary to suppress such insurrections, \\"and to cause the said laws or process to be duly executed\\". * Section 6 deals with states that refuse to jail persons imprisoned under federal law. It authorizes U.S. marshals to jail such persons in \\"other convenient places, within the limits of said state\\" and to make provisions for this purpose. * Section 8 is a sunset clause, stating that the \\"first and fifth sections of this act, shall be in force until the end of the next session of Congress, and no longer.\\" Background behind implementation South Carolina had been sorely disappointed by negotiations surrounding the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832. The state declared the two acts unconstitutional and refused to collect federal import tariffs. President Andrew Jackson saw the nullification doctrine as being equivalent to treason. In an early draft of what would eventually become his \\"Proclamation to the People of South Carolina\\" on December 10, 1832, Jackson declared to the South Carolina government: > Seduced as you have been, my fellow countrymen by the delusion theories and > misrepresentation of ambitious, deluded & designing men, I call upon you in > the language of truth, and with the feelings of a Father to retrace your > steps. As you value liberty and the blessings of peace blot out from the > page of your history a record so fatal to their security as this ordinance > will become if it be obeyed.

Meanwhile, Congress passed the Force Bill, which was enacted on March 2, 1833. It authorized the president to use whatever force he deemed necessary to enforce federal tariffs. South Carolina purported to nullify the Force Bill as well, but simultaneously, a Compromise Tariff was passed by Congress, defusing the crisis. While the Force Bill rejected the concept of individual states' rights to nullify federal law or to secede from the Union, this was not universally accepted. It would arise again in the buildup to the American Civil War.

The most famous example of gag rules is the series of them in effect in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1836 to 1844, concerning slavery. Context After the beginning of the earnest agitation of Northern abolitionists against the institution of slavery in the United States in 1831, over 130,000 petitions of various kinds poured into the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate praying for the abolition or the restriction of that \\"peculiar institution\\", as it was called in the South. There was a special focus on slavery in the District of Columbia, where slave policy was a federal, rather than state, matter. The petitions were usually presented by former president John Quincy Adams, who as a member of the House of Representatives identified himself particularly with the struggle against any Congressional abridgment of the right of petition. The pro-slavery forces responded with a series of gag rules that automatically \\"tabled\\" all such petitions, preventing them from being read or discussed due to their insistence that the federal government could not interfere with the domestic institutions of the states. Pinckney Resolutions (1836) The House of Representatives passed the Pinckney Resolutions, authored by Henry L. Pinckney of South Carolina, on May 26, 1836. The first stated that Congress had no constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in the states, and the second that it \\"ought not\\" to interfere with slavery in the District of Columbia. The third was known from the beginning as the \\"gag rule\\", and passed with a vote of 117 to 68: From the inception of the gag resolutions, Adams was a central figure in the opposition to the gag rules. He argued that they were a direct violation of the First Amendment right \\"to petition the Government for a redress of grievances\\". A majority of Northern Whigs joined the opposition. Rather than suppress anti-slavery petitions, however, the gag rules only served to offend Americans from Northern states, and dramatically increase the number of petitions. The growing objection to the gag rule, as well as the Panic of 1837, may have contributed to the Whig majority in the 27th Congress, the party's first such majority. Since the original gag was a resolution, not a standing House Rule, it had to be renewed every session, and Adams and others had free rein until then. In January 1837, the Pinckney Resolutions were substantially renewed, more than a month into the session. The pro-gag forces gradually succeeded in shortening the debate and tightening the gag. United States Senate Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina attempted to create a Senate gag rule in 1836. The Senate rejected this proposal, which pro-slavery senators thought would have the rebound (reverse) effect of strengthening the abolition movement. They agreed on a method which, while technically not a gag that violated the right to petition, had the same effect. If an anti-slavery petition were presented, the Senate would vote not on whether to accept the petition, but on whether to consider the question of accepting the petition. The Senate never voted in favor of considering the acceptance of any petition. Patton (1837) and Atherton (1838) gag rules In December 1837, the Congress passed the Patton Resolutions, introduced by John M. Patton of Virginia. In December 1838, the Congress passed the Atherton gag, composed by Democratic \\"States Rights\\" Congressman Charles G. Atherton of New Hampshire, on the first petition day of the session. Example of petitions presented on a single day (February 18, 1839) * 53 men and 23 women, of Livingston County, New York, \\"remonstrating against the espionage in which the post office in Richmond, Virginia, and post offices in other places, are subjected, with the knowledge of the Postmastef General\\". * 17 men of Lenox, New York, protesting the \\"mob violence\\" against Amos Dresser (Tennessee), Aaron W. Kitchell (Georgia), and Elijah P. Lovejoy (Illinois); the \\"unlawful seizure and imprisonment for eight months\\" of Reuben Crandall; and that a Senator from South Carolina \\"declared...that, if any abolitionist come to that State, he would be hung, despite any government on earth\\". * Petitions for the recognition of Haiti from 405 men and women of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, 49 men of Northfield, Vermont, 96 men and women of Vershire, Vermont, 28 men of Walton, New York, 26 men of Williamsburg, New York, 194 men and women of Marlborough, New Hampshire, 52 men of Landaff, New Hampshire, 79 men and women of Belmont County, Ohio, 204 men from various northeastern states. * 9 petitions, from over 600 individuals, seeking the rescinding of the Atherton gag [see above] * 58 petitions, from over 5,000 individuals, seeking:  \\"The abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia,  The abolition of the slave-trade in the District of Columbia  The prohibition of the slave‚Äìtrade between the states,  The abolition of slavery in the Territory of Florida,  The abolition of slavery and the slave-trade in all the other territories of the United States,  The refusal to admit any new slave state into the Union,  The rejection of all propositions for the admission of Texas.\\" From December 1838 to March 1839, the Twenty-Fifth Congress received \\"almost fifteen hundred petitions signed by more than one hundred thousand people. Eighty percent of the signatories supported abolition in the capital\\". Twenty-first rule (1840) In January 1840, the House of Representatives passed the Twenty-first Rule, which greatly changed the nature of the fight: it prohibited even the reception of anti-slavery petitions and was a standing House rule. Before, the pro-slavery forces had to struggle to impose a gag before the anti-slavery forces got the floor. Now men like Adams or William Slade were trying to revoke a standing rule. However, it had less support than the original Pinckney gag, passing only by 114 to 108, with substantial opposition among Northern Democrats and even some Southern Whigs, and with serious doubts about its constitutionality. Throughout the gag period, Adams' \\"superior talent in using and abusing parliamentary rules\\" and skill in baiting his enemies into making mistakes, enabled him to evade the rule. Repeal of the gag rule (1844) The gag was finally rescinded on December 3, 1844, by a vote of 108‚Äì80, all the Northern and four Southern Whigs voting for repeal, along with 78% of the Northern Democrats. It was John Quincy Adams who wrote the repeal resolution and created the coalition necessary to pass it.Nagel, Paul C.. John Quincy Adams: A Public Life, a Private Life. p. 359. 1999, Harvard University Press. Other examples of gag rules England A gag rule may be formally neutral, that is, forbidding discussions or arguments either for or against a particular policy. For example, William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury during the reign of King Charles I of England: > forbade ministers to discuss the sublime mysteries associated with Calvin's > doctrine of predestination. They could not preach it, nor could they preach > against it. They could not mention it at all ... For Laud, what was at stake > was not so much the promotion of his own theological opinions as the > suppression of the furor theologicus that had caused so much devastation in > England and throughout Europe in the aftermath of the Reformation. However, in practice, the effect (and in most cases, the intent) of even an even-handed ban on advocating or opposing a particular policy will be to entrench the status quo. Japan Malaysia A present-day example can be found in the Dewan Negara (Senate) of Malaysia, which has a standing order prohibiting any member from proposing the repeal of those articles of the Malaysian Constitution that reserve certain privileges for Bumiputra (such as ethnic Malay) citizens and questioning the status of Bahasa Malaysia as the national language. United States Ms. magazine criticized the use of the gag rule on women in its winter 2008 issue Related to abortion rights, the so-called Mexico City policy, which prohibits U.S. funding for organizations that provide abortions, referrals to abortion providers, and in some cases any family planning (birth control) information, is sometimes referred to as the \\"global gag rule\\".

It required payment for government land to be in gold and silver. History The Specie Circular was a reaction to the growing concerns about excessive speculations of land after the Indian removal, which was mostly done with soft currency. The sale of public lands increased five times between 1834 and 1836. Speculators paid for these purchases with depreciating paper money. While government law already demanded that land purchases be completed with specie or paper notes from specie-backed banks, a large portion of buyers used paper money from state banks not backed by hard money. Executive order On July 11, 1836, Jackson ordered Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury to issue the Specie Circular under federal law whereby the government refused to take anything but gold and silver specie for sales of public lands of over 320 acres after August 15, 1836. It did make a special exception to accept certain types of Virginia scrip. The executive order allowed legitimate settlers (non- speculators, or those purchasing plots of 320 acres or less) to use paper until December 15, 1836. Consequences Because the order was one of Jackson's last acts in office, most of its consequences occurred during and were attributed to the Presidency of Martin van Buren. The devaluation of paper currency only increased with Jackson's proclamation. This sent inflation and prices upwards. Many at the time (and historians subsequently) blamed the Specie Circular for the rise in prices and the following Panic of 1837. Cries of \\"Rescind the circular!\\" went up and former President Jackson sent word to Van Buren asking him not to rescind the order. Jackson believed that it had to be given enough time to work. Lobbying efforts, especially by bankers, increased in Washington in an attempt to revoke the Specie Circular. Others, like Nicholas Biddle, believed that Jackson's defeat of the Second Bank of the United States was directly responsible for the irresponsible creation of paper money by the state banks which had precipitated this crisis. The restrictions on credit caused by the order resulted in numerous bankruptcies and the failure of smaller banks. In the South the resulting recession drove down cotton prices well into the 1840s. Small farmers who had bought land on credit were unable to meet their loan repayments with their income from staple crops cut by a half. When they defaulted, \\"[t]heir land and slaves were repossessed and sold at auction, usually to already well-established slaveholders. ... Some farmers were able to keep a few acres and eke out a living as lesser yeomen. But many lost everything and fell into tenancy and sharecropping. When the cotton market finally recovered, affluent slaveholders held nearly all the South‚Äôs best land.\\" Democratic split The Democratic party split in two ways regarding the order. Some, like Thomas Hart Benton, supported the use of sound money. The Locofoco wing of the party also agreed with Benton. Senators Nathaniel P. Tallmadge and William C. Rives supported the other side of the party, in favor of paper money. In the United States House of Representatives, John Bell even challenged his own party member, James K. Polk, for his position as Speaker of the House of Representatives over the issue.

The conflict over the Wilmot Proviso was one of the major events leading to the American Civil War. Congressman David Wilmot of Pennsylvania first introduced the proviso in the House of Representatives on August 8, 1846, as a rider on a $2,000,000 appropriations bill intended for the final negotiations to resolve the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (this was only three months into the two-year war). If successful, the Wilmot Proviso would have effectively cancelled out the 1820 Missouri Compromise, since it would have prohibited slavery in an area below the parallel 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ north. It passed the House but failed in the Senate, where the South had greater representation. It was reintroduced in February 1847 and again passed the House and failed in the Senate. In 1848, an attempt to make it part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo also failed. Sectional political disputes over slavery in the Southwest continued until the Compromise of 1850. Background After an earlier attempt to acquire Texas by treaty had failed to receive the necessary two-thirds approval of the Senate, the United States annexed the Republic of Texas by a joint resolution of Congress that required simply a majority vote in each house of Congress. President John Tyler signed the bill on March 1, 1845, a few days before his term ended. As many expected, the annexation led to war with Mexico. After the Capture of New Mexico and California in the first phases of the war, the political focus shifted to how much territory would be acquired from Mexico. The key to this was the determination of the future status of slavery in any new territory. Both major political parties had labored long to keep divisive slavery issues out of national politics. The Democrats had generally been successful in portraying those within their party attempting to push a purely sectional issue as extremists that were well outside the normal scope of traditional politics. Silbey pg. 123 However, midway through Polk's term, Democratic dissatisfaction with the administration was growing within the Martin Van Buren, or Barnburner, wing of the Democratic Party over other issues. Many felt that Van Buren had been unfairly denied the party's nomination in 1844 when southern delegates resurrected a convention rule, last used in 1832, requiring that the nominee had to receive two-thirds of the delegate votes. Many in the North were also upset with the Walker tariff which reduced the tariff rates; others were opposed to Polk's veto of a popular river and harbor improvements bill, and still others were upset over the Oregon settlement with Great Britain where it appeared that Polk did not pursue the northern territory with the same vigor he used to acquire Texas. Polk was seen more and more as enforcing strict party loyalty primarily to serve southern interests. Morrison p.42. Johannsen pg. 202. Potter pg. 22‚Äì29 Taylor The Whigs faced a different scenario. The victory of James K. Polk (Democrat) over Henry Clay (Whig) in the 1844 presidential election had caught the Southern Whigs by surprise. The key element of this defeat, which carried over into the congressional and local races in 1845 and 1846 throughout the South, was the party's failure to take a strong stand favoring Texas annexation. Southern Whigs were reluctant to repeat their mistakes on Texas, but, at the same time, Whigs from both sections realized that victory and territorial acquisition would again bring out the issue of slavery and the territories. In the South in particular, there was already the realization, or perhaps fear, that the old economic issues that had defined the Second Party System were already dead. Their political goal was to avoid any sectional debate over slavery which would expose the sectional divisions within the party. Cooper pg. 225‚Äì229. Introduction and debate on the proviso On Saturday, August 8, 1846, President Polk submitted to Congress a request for $2,000,000 in order to facilitate negotiations with Mexico over the final settlement of the war. The request came with no public warning after Polk had failed to arrange for approval of the bill with no Congressional debate. With Congress scheduled to adjourn that Monday, Democratic leadership arranged for the bill to be immediately considered in a special night session. The debate was to be limited to two hours with no individual speech to last more than ten minutes. Potter pg. 18‚Äì19 David Wilmot, a Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, and a group of other Barnburner Democrats including Preston King and Timothy Jenkins of New York, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, Gideon Welles of Connecticut, and Jacob Brinkerhoff of Ohio,Earle pg. 233 fn. 1. Brinkerhoff is claimed by some historians to have been the actual author of the proviso. had already been meeting in early August strategy meetings. Wilmot had a strong record of supporting the Polk Administration and was close to many Southerners. With the likelihood that Wilmot would have no trouble gaining the floor in the House debate, he was chosen to present the amendment to the appropriations bill that would carry his name.Silbey pg. 124. Potter pg. 21. Richards pg. 150. Fire- eater William L. Yancey (Democrat) in 1846 considered Wilmot as the one Northerner that could be trusted. Walther pg. 91 Wilmot offered the following to the House in language modeled after the Northwest Ordinance of 1787: > Provided, That, as an express and fundamental condition to the acquisition > of any territory from the Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue > of any treaty which may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the > Executive of the moneys herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary > servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime, > whereof the party shall first be duly convicted. Missouri Compromise Line. Modern state boundaries are shown for reference. William W. Wick, Democrat of Indiana, attempted to eliminate total restriction of slavery by proposing an amendment that the Missouri Compromise line of latitude 36¬∞30' simply be extended west to the Pacific. This was voted down 89‚Äì54. The vote to add the proviso to the bill was then called, and it passed by 83‚Äì64. A last-ditch effort by southerners to table the entire bill was defeated by 94‚Äì78, and then the entire bill was approved 85‚Äì80. These votes fell overwhelmingly along sectional rather than party lines.Morrison pg. 41. Potter pg. 22. Richards pg. 152 The Senate took up the bill late in its Monday session. Southern Democrats hoped to reject the Wilmot Proviso and send the bill back to the House for a quick approval of the bill without the restrictions on slavery. Whig John Davis of Massachusetts attempted to forestall this effort by holding the floor until it would be too late to return the bill to the House, forcing the Senate to accept or reject the appropriation with the proviso intact. However, before he could call the vote, due to an eight-minute difference in the official House and Senate clocks, the House had adjourned and the Congress was officially out of session.Potter pg.22‚Äì23 The issue resurfaced at the end of the year when Polk, in his annual message to Congress, renewed his request with the amount needed increasing to three million dollars. Polk argued that, while the original intent of the war had never been to acquire territory (a view hotly contested by his opponents), an honorable peace required territorial compensation to the United States. Morrison pg. 53 The Three Million Dollar Bill, as it was called, was the sole item of business in the House from February 8, 1847, until February 15. Preston King reintroduced the Wilmot Proviso, but this time the exclusion of slavery was expanded beyond merely the Mexican territory to include \\"any territory on the continent of America which shall hereafter be acquired\\". This time Representative Stephen Douglas, Democrat of Illinois, reintroduced the proposal to simply extend the Missouri Compromise line to the west coast, and this was again defeated 109‚Äì82. The Three Million Dollar Bill with the proviso was then passed by the House 115‚Äì106. In the Senate, led by Thomas Hart Benton (Democrat), the bill was passed without the proviso. When the bill was returned to the House the Senate bill prevailed; every Northern Whig still supported the proviso, but 22 Northern Democrats voted with the South. Richards pg. 152‚Äì153. Johannsen pg. 204. Silbey pg. 130‚Äì131 In 1848, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the war was submitted to the Senate for approval. Douglas, now in the Senate, was among those who joined with the South to defeat an effort to attach the Wilmot Proviso to the treaty. Unlike appropriations bills that constitutionally were required to be initiated in the House, since a treaty was involved the debate this time would only involve the Senate. In the prior year's debate in the House, Douglas had argued that all of the debate over slavery in the territories was premature; the time to deal with that issue was when the territory was actually organized by Congress.Johannsen pg. 216‚Äì217 Lewis Cass (Democrat) in December 1847, in his famous letter to A. O. P. Nicholson in Tennessee, further defined the concept of popular sovereignty which would soon evolve as the mainstream Democratic alternative to the Wilmot Proviso: > Leave it to the people, who will be affected by this question to adjust it > upon their own responsibility, and in their own manner, and we shall render > another tribute to the original principles of our government, and furnish > another for its permanence and prosperity.Johannsen pg. 227 Aftermath An animation showing the free/slave status of U.S. states and territories, 1789‚Äì1861, including the proposed Wilmot Proviso. With the approval of the treaty, the issue moved from one of abstraction to one involving practical matters. The nature of the Constitution, slavery, the value of free labor, political power, and ultimately political realignment were all involved in the debate. Holt pg. 50 Historian Michael Morrison argues that from 1820 to 1846 a combination of \\"racism and veneration of the Union\\" had prevented a direct Northern attack on slavery. While the original Southern response to the Wilmot Proviso was measured, it soon became clear to the South that this long postponed attack on slavery had finally occurred. Rather than simply discuss the politics of the issue, historian William Freehling noted, \\"Most Southerners raged primarily because David Wilmot's holier-than-thou stance was so insulting.\\"Freehling pg 461 In the North, the most immediate repercussions involved Martin Van Buren and the state of New York. The Barnburners were successfully opposed by their conservative opposition, the Hunkers, in their efforts to send a pro-proviso batch of delegates to the 1848 Democratic National Convention. The Barnburners held their own separate convention and sent their own slate of delegates to the convention in Baltimore. Both delegations were seated with the state's total votes split between them. When the convention rejected a pro-proviso plank Political Party Platforms and selected Lewis Cass as the nominee, the Barnburners again bolted and were the nucleus of forming the Free Soil Party. Richards pg. 154‚Äì155 Historian Leonard Richards writes of these disaffected Democrats: > Overall, then, Southern Democrats during the 1840s lost the hard core of > their original doughface support. No longer could they count on New England > and New York Democrats to provide them with winning margins in the House. > ... > To them [Free Soil Democrats] the movement to acquire Texas, and the fight > over the Wilmot Proviso, marked the turning point, when aggressive > slavemasters stole the heart and soul of the Democratic Party and began > dictating the course of the nation's destiny.Richards pg. 159 Historian William Cooper presents the exactly opposite Southern perspective: > Southern Democrats, for whom slavery had always been central, had little > difficulty in perceiving exactly what the proviso meant for them and their > party. In the first place the mere existence of the proviso meant the > sectional strains that had plagued the Whigs on Texas now beset the > Democrats on expansion, the issue the Democrats themselves had chosen as > their own. The proviso also announced to southerners that they had to face > the challenge of certain northern Democrats who indicated their > unwillingness to follow any longer the southern lead on slavery. That > circumstance struck at the very roots of the southern conception of party. > The southerners had always felt that their Northern colleagues must toe the > southern line on all slavery-related issues. Cooper pg. 233‚Äì234 In Alabama, with no available candidate sufficiently opposed to the proviso, William L. Yancey secured the adoption by the state Democratic convention of the so-called \\"Alabama Platform\\", which was endorsed by the legislatures of Alabama and Georgia and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia. The platform called for no federal restrictions of slavery in the territories, no restrictions on slavery by territorial governments until the point where they were drafting a state constitution in order to petition Congress for statehood, opposition to any candidates supporting either the proviso or popular sovereignty, and positive federal legislation overruling Mexican anti-slavery laws in the Mexican Cession. However, the same Democratic Convention that had refused to endorse the proviso also rejected incorporating the Yancey proposal into the national platform by a 216‚Äì36 vote. Unlike the Barnburner walkout, however, only Yancey and one other Alabama delegate left the convention. Yancey's efforts to stir up a third party movement in the state failed.Walther p. 102‚Äì117. Niven pg. 314. South Carolina had boycotted the entire convention, but a single South Carolinian was admitted by the convention as the state's delegation, and he cast all nine of the state's votes at the convention. Southerner Whigs looked hopefully to slaveholder and war hero General Zachary Taylor as the solution to the widening sectional divide even though he took no public stance on the Wilmot Proviso. However, Taylor, once nominated and elected, showed that he had his own plans. Taylor hoped to create a new non-partisan coalition that would once again remove slavery from the national stage. He expected to be able to accomplish this by freezing slavery at its 1849 boundaries and by immediately bypassing the territory stage and creating two new states out of the Mexican Cession. Cooper pg. 243‚Äì245, 273‚Äì176 The opening salvo in a new level of sectional conflict occurred on December 13, 1848, when John G. Palfrey (Whig) of Massachusetts introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. Throughout 1849 in the South \\"the rhetoric of resistance to the North escalated and spread\\". The potentially secessionist Nashville Convention was scheduled for June 1850. Walther p. 118‚Äì122 When President Taylor in his December 1849 message to Congress urged the admission of California as a free state, a state of crisis was further aggravated. Historian Allan Nevins sums up the situation which had been created by the Wilmot Proviso: > Thus the contest was joined on the central issue which was to dominate all > American history for the next dozen years, the disposition of the > Territories. Two sets of extremists had arisen: Northerners who demanded no > new slave territories under any circumstances, and Southerners who demanded > free entry for slavery into all territories, the penalty for denial to be > secession. For the time being, moderates who hoped to find a way of > compromise and to repress the underlying issue of slavery itself ‚Äì its > toleration or non-toleration by a great free Christian state ‚Äì were > overwhelmingly in the majority. But history showed that in crises of this > sort the two sets of extremists were almost certain to grow in power, > swallowing up more and more members of the conciliatory center. Nevins p. > 12‚Äì13 Combined with other slavery-related issues, the Wilmot Proviso led to the Compromise of 1850, which helped buy another uncertain decade of peace. Radical secessionists were temporarily at bay as the Nashville Convention failed to endorse secession. Moderates rallied around the Compromise as the final solution to the sectional issues involving slavery and the territories. At the same time, however, the language of the Georgia Platform, widely accepted throughout the South, made it clear that the South's commitment to Union was not unqualified; they fully expected the North to adhere to their part of the agreement. In regard to the territory the Proviso would have covered, California had a brief period of slavery due to slave owning settlers arriving during the 1848 California Gold Rush. Since there were no slave patrols or laws protecting slavery in the territory, slave escapes were quite common. Ultimately, California decided to ban slavery in their 1849 constitution and was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850. Nevada would never have legal slavery and was admitted to the Union as a free state in 1864. The territories of Utah and New Mexico would have slavery from the time they were acquired by America in 1848 until July of 1862, when the United States banned slavery in all federal territories. However, Utah's experience was with slavery was minimal, as the 1860 census recorded only 30 slaves in the entire state.https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/applied-and-social- sciences-magazines/slavery-far-west-ca-co-nm-nv-or-ut-wa See also *Slave Trade Acts *Proviso Township, Illinois, named for the Wilmot Proviso Notes Bibliography     External links * Wilmot Proviso * Slavery in the United States Legal history of the United States Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War History of the United States (1849‚Äì1865) African-American history History of United States expansionism United States federal territory and statehood legislation Origins of the American Civil War Expansion of slavery in the United States ","title":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":"55578","text":"Full employment is a situation in which there is no cyclical or deficient- demand unemployment. Full employment does not entail the disappearance of all unemployment, as other kinds of unemployment, namely structural and frictional, may remain. For instance, workers who are \\"between jobs\\" for short periods of time as they search for better employment are not counted against full employment, as such unemployment is frictional rather than cyclical. An economy with full employment might also have unemployment or underemployment where part-time workers cannot find jobs appropriate to their skill level,E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) SSRN, part 2, charts at 6, 10 and 22 as such unemployment is considered structural rather than cyclical. Full employment marks the point past which expansionary fiscal and/or monetary policy cannot reduce unemployment any further without causing inflation. Some economists define full employment somewhat differently, as the unemployment rate at which inflation does not continuously increase. Advocacy of avoiding accelerating inflation is based on a theory centered on the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), and those who hold it usually mean NAIRU when speaking of full employment.https://www.vox.com/2014/11/14/7027823/nairu-natural-rate- unemployment The NAIRU has also been described by Milton Friedman, among others, as the \\"natural\\" rate of unemployment. Such views tend to emphasize sustainability, noting that a government cannot sustain unemployment rates below the NAIRU forever: inflation will continue to grow so long as unemployment lies below the NAIRU. For the United States, economist William T. Dickens found that full-employment unemployment rate varied a lot over time but equaled about 5.5 percent of the civilian labor force during the 2000s. Recently, economists have emphasized the idea that full employment represents a \\"range\\" of possible unemployment rates. For example, in 1999, in the United States, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) gives an estimate of the \\"full-employment unemployment rate\\" of 4 to 6.4%. This is the estimated unemployment rate at full employment, plus & minus the standard error of the estimate.http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/44/50/2086120.pdf The concept of full employment of labor corresponds to the concept of potential output or potential real GDP and the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve. In neoclassical macroeconomics, the highest sustainable level of aggregate real GDP or \\"potential\\" is seen as corresponding to a vertical LRAS curve: any increase in the demand for real GDP can only lead to rising prices in the long run, while any increase in output is temporary.  Economic concept  What most neoclassical economists mean by \\"full\\" employment is a rate somewhat less than 100% employment. Others, such as the late James Tobin, have been accused of disagreeing, considering full employment as 0% unemployment.\\"As a young professor I did a paper where I analyzed the optimal unemployment rate,\\" said Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York, who knew Tobin at Yale. \\"Tobin went livid over the idea. To him the optimal unemployment rate was zero.\\" Yale's Tobin Guides Obama From Grave as Friedman Is Eclipsed However, this was not Tobin's perspective in his later work.See, for example, \\"Inflation and Unemployment\\" by James Tobin, The American Economic Review, Vol. 62, No. 1/2 (Mar. 1, 1972), pp. 1-18. Some see John Maynard Keynes as attacking the existence of rates of unemployment substantially above 0%: :\\"The Conservative belief that there is some law of nature which prevents men from being employed, that it is 'rash' to employ men, and that it is financially 'sound' to maintain a tenth of the population in idleness for an indefinite period, is crazily improbable - the sort of thing which no man could believe who had not had his head fuddled with nonsense for years and years. The objections which are raised are mostly not the objections of experience or of practical men. They are based on highly abstract theories ‚Äì venerable, academic inventions, half misunderstood by those who are applying them today, and based on assumptions which are contrary to the facts‚Ä¶ Our main task, therefore, will be to confirm the reader's instinct that what seems sensible is sensible, and what seems nonsense is nonsense.\\" ‚Äì J. M. Keynes and H. D. Henderson in a pamphlet to support Lloyd George in the 1929 election. Most readers would interpret this statement as referring to only cyclical, deficient-demand, or \\"involuntary unemployment\\" (discussed below) but not to unemployment existing as \\"full employment\\" (mismatch and frictional unemployment). This is because, writing in 1929, Keynes was discussing a period in which the unemployment rate had been persistently above most conceptions of what corresponds to full employment. That is, a situation where a tenth of the population (and thus a larger percentage of the labor force) is unemployed involves a disaster. One major difference between Keynes and the Classical economists was that while the latter saw \\"full employment\\" as the normal state of affairs with a free-market economy (except for short periods of adjustment), Keynes saw the possibility of persistent aggregate-demand failure causing unemployment rates to exceed those corresponding to full employment. Put differently, while Classical economists saw all unemployment as \\"voluntary\\", Keynes saw the possibility that involuntary unemployment can exist when the demand for final products is low compared to potential output. This can be seen in his later and more serious work. In his General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, chapter 2, he used a definition that should be familiar to modern macroeconomics: :This state of affairs we shall describe as \\"full\\" employment, both \\"frictional\\" and \\"voluntary\\" unemployment being consistent with \\"full\\" employment thus defined. The only difference from the usual definitions is that, as discussed below, most economists would add skill/location mismatch or structural unemployment as existing at full employment. More theoretically, Keynes had two main definitions of full employment, which he saw as equivalent. His first main definition of full employment involves the absence of \\"involuntary\\" unemployment: : the equality of the real wage to the marginal disutility of employment ... realistically interpreted, corresponds to the absence of \\"involuntary\\" unemployment. Put another way, the full employment and the absence of involuntary unemployment correspond to the case where the real wage equals the marginal cost to workers of supplying labor for hire on the market (the \\"marginal disutility of employment\\"). That is, the real wage rate and the amount of employment correspond to a point on the aggregate supply curve of labor that is assumed to exist. In contrast, a situation with less than full employment and thus involuntary unemployment would have the real wage above the supply price of labor. That is, the employment situation corresponds to a point above and to the left of the aggregate supply curve of labor: the real wage would be above the point on the aggregate supply curve of labor at the current level of employment; alternatively, the level of employment would be below the point on that supply curve at the current real wage. Second, in chapter 3, Keynes saw full employment as a situation where \\"a further increase in the value of the effective demand will no longer be accompanied by any increase in output.\\" : In the previous chapter we have given a definition of full employment in terms of the behavior of labor. An alternative, though equivalent, criterion is that at which we have now arrived, namely a situation, in which aggregate employment is inelastic in response to an increase in the effective demand for its output. This means that at and above full employment, any increase in aggregate demand and employment corresponds primarily to increases in prices rather than output. Thus, full employment of labor corresponds to potential output. Whilst full employment is often an aim for an economy, most economists see it as more beneficial to have some level of unemployment, especially of the frictional sort. In theory, this keeps the labor market flexible, allowing room for new innovations and investment. As in the NAIRU theory, the existence of some unemployment is required to avoid accelerating inflation. Historical measurement and discussion For the United Kingdom, the OECD estimated the NAIRU (or structural unemployment) rate as being equal to 8.5% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.9% between 1998 and 2007, 6.2%, 6.6%, and 6.7 in 2008, 2009, and 2010, then staying at 6.9% in 2011‚Äì2013. For the United States, they estimate it as being 5.8% on average between 1988 and 1997, 5.5% between 1998 and 2007, 5.8% in 2008, 6.0% in 2009, and then staying at 6.1% from 2010 to 2013. They also estimate the NAIRU for other countries.http://www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/economicoutlookannextables.htm table 22. These estimates are done using the commonly-used definition of unemployment rather than using the measures based on efforts to standardize the measure of unemployment across countries. These calculations have been criticised as lacking any foundation in evidence.E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) SSRN, part 2(1) The era after the 2007-2009 Great Recession shows the relevance of this concept, for example as seen in the United States. On the one hand, in 2013 Keynesian economists such as Paul Krugman of Princeton University see unemployment rates as too high relative to full employment and the NAIRU and thus favor increasing the aggregate demand for goods and services and thus labor in order to reduce unemployment. On the other hand, pointing to shortages of some skilled workers, some businesspeople and Classical economists suggest that the U.S. economy is already at full employment, so that any demand stimulus will lead to nothing but rising inflation rates. One example was Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, who has since changed his mind.  Unemployment and inflation   Unemployment at Beveridge Full Employment  William Beveridge defined \\"full employment\\" as where the number of unemployed workers equaled the number of job vacancies available (while preferring that the economy be kept above that full employment level in order to allow maximum economic production). This definition allows for certain kinds of unemployment, where the number of unemployed workers equals the number of vacancies. Unemployment of this kind can take two forms: frictional and structural. Frictional unemployment is where the unemployed are searching for the best possible jobs whilst employers are also searching for the best possible employees to fulfil those jobs. Structural unemployment exists when the skills and geographical locations of the unemployed workers do not correspond to the skill requirements and locations of the vacancies. In either case, there exists a job for every worker, and a worker for every job. An economy with less than full employment in Beveridge's sense will have either classical unemployment, cyclical unemployment, or both. Classical unemployment results from the actual real wage rising above the equilibrium real wage, so that the quantity of labor demanded (and the number of vacancies) is less than the quantity of labor supplied (and the number of unemployed workers). This might occur because of inefficient interference in the market; for example, a minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage; but also because of market failure, such as that caused by cartels. Under classical unemployment, the ways by which a return to Beveridge full employment can occur depend on the nature of the rise in wages- if it is only \\"nominal\\" wages that are rigid (failing to return to equilibrium), then real wages can decrease if prices rise relative to the rigid nominal wages. If nominal wages track price levels, however, then changes to prices will not affect the real wage- and thus employment will remain below Beveridge full employment. Cyclical, deficient- demand, or Keynesian unemployment occurs when there is not enough aggregate demand in the economy to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work. If demand for most goods and services falls, less production is needed and consequently fewer workers are needed: if wages are sticky and do not fall to meet the new equilibrium level, unemployment results, because (as with classical unemployment) there are more prospective workers than there are vacancies.  The Phillips curve  The theories behind the Phillips curve pointed to the inflationary costs of lowering the unemployment rate. That is, as unemployment rates fell and the economy approached full employment, the inflation rate would rise. But this theory also says that there is no single unemployment number that one can point to as the \\"full employment\\" rate. Instead, there is a trade-off between unemployment and inflation: a government might choose to attain a lower unemployment rate but would pay for it with higher inflation rates. In essence, in this view, the meaning of ‚Äúfull employment‚Äù is really nothing but a matter of opinion based on how the benefits of lowering the unemployment rate compare to the costs of raising the inflation rate. Though their theory had been proposed by the Keynesian economist Abba Lerner several years before , it was the work of Milton Friedman, leader of the monetarist school of economics, and Edmund Phelps that ended the popularity of this concept of full employment. In 1968, Friedman posited the theory that full employment rate of unemployment was ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôunique‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô at any given time. He called it the \\"natural\\" rate of unemployment. Instead of being a matter of opinion and normative judgment, it is something we are stuck with, even if it is unknown. As discussed further, below, inflation/unemployment trade-offs cannot be relied upon. Further, rather than trying to attain full employment, Friedman argues that policy-makers should try to keep prices stable (meaning a low or even a zero inflation rate). If this policy is sustained, he suggests that a free-market economy will gravitate to the \\"natural\\" rate of unemployment automatically.  The NAIRU  Phillips Curve before and after Expansionary Policy, with Long-Run Phillips Curve (NAIRU) In an effort to avoid the normative connotations of the word \\"natural,\\" James Tobin (following the lead of Franco Modigliani), introduced the term the ‚ÄúNon-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment‚Äù (NAIRU), which corresponds to the situation where the real gross domestic product equals potential output. It has been called the \\"inflation threshold\\" unemployment rate or the inflation barrier. This concept is identical to Milton Friedman‚Äôs concept of the \\"natural\\" rate but reflects the fact that there is nothing \\"natural\\" about an economy. The level of the NAIRU depends on the degree of \\"supply side\\" unemployment, i.e., joblessness that can't be abolished by high demand. This includes frictional, mismatch, and Classical unemployment. When the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU, there is no cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment. That is, Keynes‚Äô involuntary unemployment does not exist. To understand this concept, start with the actual unemployment equal to the NAIRU. Then, assume that a country's government and its central bank use demand-side policy to reduce the unemployment rate and then attempt to keep the rate at a specific low level: rising budget deficits or falling interest rates increase aggregate demand and raise employment of labor. Thus, the actual unemployment rate falls, as going from point A to B in the nearby graph. Unemployment then stays below the NAIRU for years or more, as at point B. In this situation, the theory behind the NAIRU posits that inflation will accelerate, i.e. get worse and worse (in the absence of wage and price controls). As the short-run Phillips curve theory indicates, higher inflation rate results from low unemployment. That is, in terms of the \\"trade- off\\" theory, low unemployment can be \\"bought,\\" paid for by suffering from higher inflation. But the NAIRU theory says that this is not the whole story, so that the trade-off breaks down: a persistently higher inflation rate is eventually incorporated as higher inflationary expectations. Then, if workers and employers expect higher inflation, it results in higher inflation, as higher money wages are passed on to consumers as higher prices. This causes the short run Phillips curve to shift to the right and upward, worsening the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. At a given unemployment rate, inflation accelerates. But if the unemployment rate rises to equal the NAIRU, we see higher inflation than before the expansionary policies, as at point C in the nearby diagram. The fall of the unemployment rate was temporary because it could not be sustained. In sum, the trade-off between inflation and unemployment cannot be relied upon to be stable: taking advantage of it causes it to disappear. This story fits the experience of the United States during the late 1960s, during which unemployment rates stayed low (below 4% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates rose significantly. Second, examine the other main case. Again start with the unemployment rate equal to the NAIRU. Then, either shrinking government budget deficits (or rising government surpluses) or rising real interest rates encourage higher unemployment. In this situation, the NAIRU theory says that inflation will get better (decelerate) if unemployment rates exceed the NAIRU for a long time. High unemployment leads to lower inflation, which in turn causes lower inflationary expectations and a further round of lower inflation. High unemployment causes the short-run inflation/unemployment trade-off to improve. This story fits the experience of the United States during the early 1980s (Paul Volcker's war against inflation), during which unemployment rates stayed high (at about 10% of the civilian labor force) and inflation rates fell significantly. Finally, the NAIRU theory says that the inflation rate does not rise or fall when the unemployment equals the \\"natural\\" rate. This is where the term NAIRU is derived. In macroeconomics, the case where the actual unemployment rate equals the NAIRU is seen as the long-run equilibrium because there are no forces inside the normal workings of the economy that cause the inflation rate to rise or fall. The NAIRU corresponds to the long-run Phillips curve. While the short-run Phillips curve is based on a constant rate of inflationary expectations, the long-run Phillips curve reflects full adjustment of inflationary expectations to the actual experience of inflation in the economy. As mentioned above, Abba Lerner had developed a version of the NAIRU before the modern \\"natural\\" rate or NAIRU theories were developed. Unlike the currently dominant view, Lerner saw a range of \\"full employment\\" unemployment rates. Crucially, the unemployment rate depended on the economy's institution. Lerner distinguished between \\"high\\" full employment, which was the lowest sustainable unemployment under incomes policies, and \\"low\\" full employment, i.e., the lowest sustainable unemployment rate without these policies. Further, it is possible that the value of the NAIRU depends on government policy, rather than being \\"natural\\" and unvarying. A government can attempt to make people \\"employable\\" by both positive means (e.g. using training courses) and negative means (e.g. cuts in unemployment insurance benefits). These policies do not necessarily create full employment. Instead, the point is to reduces the amount of mismatch unemployment by facilitating the linking of unemployed workers with the available jobs by training them and or subsidizing their moving to the geographic location of the jobs. In addition, the hysteresis hypothesis says that the NAIRU does not stay the same over time‚Äîand can change due to economic policy.Hargreaves Heap, Shawn P. (1980). Choosing the Wrong ‚ÄúNatural‚Äù Rate: Accelerating Inflation or Decelerating Employment and Growth? Economic Journal. vol. 90 (September): 611-620. A persistently low unemployment rate makes it easier for those workers who are unemployed for \\"mismatch\\" reasons to move to where the jobs are and/or to attain the training necessary for the available vacancies (often by getting those jobs and receiving on-the-job training). On the other hand, high unemployment makes it more difficult for those workers to adjust, while hurting their morale, job- seeking skills, and the value of their work skills. Thus, some economists argue that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's anti-inflation policies using persistently high unemployment led to higher mismatch or structural unemployment and a higher NAIRU.  Uncertainty  Whatever the definition of full employment, it is difficult to discover exactly what unemployment rate it corresponds to. In the United States, for example, the economy saw stable inflation despite low unemployment during the late 1990s, contradicting most economists' estimates of the NAIRU. The idea that the full-employment unemployment rate (NAIRU) is not a unique number has been seen in recent empirical research. Staiger, Stock, and Watson found that the range of possible values of the NAIRU (from 4.3 to 7.3% unemployment) was too large to be useful to macroeconomic policy-makers. Robert Eisner suggested that for 1956-95 there was a zone from about 5% to about 10% unemployment between the low-unemployment realm of accelerating inflation and the high-unemployment realm of disinflation. In between, he found that inflation falls with falling unemployment.  Policy  The active pursuit of national full employment through interventionist government policies is associated with Keynesian economics and marked the postwar agenda of many Western nations, until the stagflation of the 1970s.  Australia  Australia was the first country in the world in which full employment in a capitalist society was made official policy by its government. On May 30, 1945, The Australian Labor Party Prime Minister John Curtin and his Employment Minister John Dedman proposed a white paper in the Australian House of Representatives titled Full Employment In Australia, the first time any government apart from totalitarian regimes had unequivocally committed itself to providing work for any person who was willing and able to work. Conditions of full employment lasted in Australia from 1941 to 1975.  United States  The United States is, as a statutory matter, committed to full employment; the government is empowered to effect this goal.\\"A bill to establish and translate into practical reality the right of all adult Americans able, willing, and seeking to work to full opportunity for useful paid employment at fair rates of compensation;\\" Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (1978) The relevant legislation is the Employment Act (1946), initially the \\"Full Employment Act,\\" later amended in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act (1978). The 1946 act was passed in the aftermath of World War II, when it was feared that demobilization would result in a depression, as it had following World War I in the Depression of 1920‚Äì21, while the 1978 act was passed following the 1973‚Äì75 recession and in the midst of continuing high inflation. The law states that full employment is one of four economic goals, in concert with growth in production, price stability, balance of trade, and budget, and that the US shall rely primarily on private enterprise to achieve these goals. Specifically, the Act is committed to an unemployment rate of no more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over, and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over (from 1983 onwards), and the Act expressly allows (but does not require) the government to create a \\"reservoir of public employment\\" to affect this level of employment. These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay so as to not draw the workforce away from the private sector. However, since the passage of this Act in 1978, the US has, , only briefly achieved this level of employment on the national level in the late 1990s, though some states have neared it or met it, nor has such a reservoir of public employment been created.  Job guarantee  Post- Keynesian economistsNotably at the Center for Full Employment and Price Stability, as per references. have suggested ensuring full employment via a job guarantee program, where those who are unable to find work in the private sector are employed by the government, the stock of thus employed public sector workers fulfilling the same function as the unemployed do in controlling inflation, without the human costs of unemployment.

The following is an interesting quote from An Interview with Brian KernighanAn Interview with Brian Kernighan: Breeding Little Languages, by Allen Noren, 2009 when he was asked \\"What hooked you on programming?\\": :I think that the most fun I had programming was a summer job at Project MAC at MIT in the summer of 1966, where I worked on a program that created a job tape for the brand new GE 645 in the earliest days of Multics. I was writing in MAD, which was much easier and more pleasant than the FORTRAN and COBOL that I had written earlier, and I was using CTSS, the first time-sharing system, which was infinitely easier and more pleasant than punch cards. MAD was quite fast compared to some of the other compilers of its day. Because a number of people were interested in using the FORTRAN language and yet wanted to obtain the speed of the MAD compiler, a system called MADTRAN (written in MAD) was developed. MADTRAN was simply a translator from FORTRAN to MAD, which then produced machine code. MADTRAN was distributed through SHARE. MAD/I has a syntactic structure similar to ALGOL 60 together with important features from the original MAD and from PL/I. MAD/I was designed as an extensible language. It was available for use under MTS and provided many new ideas which made their way into other languages, but MAD/I compilations were slow and MAD/I never extended itself into widespread use when compared to the original 7090 MAD. GOM is essentially the 7090 MAD language modified and extended for the 360/370 architecture with some judicious tailoring to better fit current programming practices and problems. The MTS Message System was written in GOM.  MAD, MAD Magazine, and Alfred E.

He never worries--but from the looks of your program, you should.\\" This feature was not included in the final official version. However, it was included in the production version for the IBM 7040. And Bernie Galler remembers: :By the time we designed the language that we thought would be worth doing and for which we could do a compiler, we couldn't call it Algol any more; it really was different. That's when we adopted the name MAD, for the Michigan Algorithm Decoder. We had some funny interaction with the Mad Magazine people, when we asked for permission to use the name MAD. In a very funny letter, they told us that they would take us to court and everything else, but ended the threat with a P.S. at the bottom - \\"Sure, go ahead.\\" Unfortunately, that letter is lost.  \\"Hello, world\\" example  The \\"hello, world\\" example program prints the string \\"Hello, world\\" to a terminal or screen display. PRINT FORMAT HELLOW VECTOR VALUES HELLOW=$13h0Hello, world*$ END OF PROGRAM The first character of the line is treated as logical carriage control, in this example the character \\"0\\" which causes a double-spaced line to be printed. Alternatively, contractions can be used, and the compiler will expand them in the listing: P'T HELLOW V'S HELLOW=$13h0Hello, world*$ E'M  Language elements  MAD and GOM, but not MAD/I, are composed of the following elements:  Input format  MAD programs are a series of statements written on punched cards, generally one statement per card, although a statement can be continued to multiple cards. Columns 1-10 contains an optional statement label, comments or remarks are flagged using the letter \\"R\\" in column 11, and columns 73-80 are unused and could contain a sequence identifier. Spaces are not significant anywhere other than within character constants. For GOM input is free form with no sequence field and lines may be up to 255 characters long; lines that start with an asterisk (*) are comments; and lines that start with a plus-sign (+) are continuation lines.  Names  Variable names, function names, and statement labels have the same form, a letter followed by zero to five letters or digits. Function names end with a period. All names can be subscripted (the name followed by parentheses, with multiple subscripts separated by commas). For GOM names may be up to 24 characters long and may include the underscore (_) character. Few keywords in the language are reserved words since most are longer than six letters or are surrounded by periods. There is a standard set of abbreviations which can be used to replace the longer words. These consist of the first and last letters of the keywords with an apostrophe between them, such as W'R for WHENEVER and D'N for DIMENSION.  Data types  MAD uses the term \\"mode\\" for its data types. Five basic modes are supported: * Integer written with or without a scale factor (1, +1, -1, 1K10, 1K) or as octal constants (to 7777777777777K); * Floating Point written with or without an exponent (0., 1.5, -0.05, +100.4, -4., .05E-2, -.05E2, 5E02, 5.E2); *Boolean (1B for true and 0B for false); * Statement Label, and * Function Name written as a name followed by a period (SQRT.). The mode of a constant can be redefined by adding the character M followed by a single digit at the end of the constant, where 0 indicates floating point, 1 integer, 2 boolean, 3 function name, and 4 statement label. For GOM six additional modes are added: CHARACTER, SHORT INTEGER, BYTE INTEGER, LONG INTEGER, POINTER, and DYNAMIC RECORD. Alphabetic or character constants are stored as integers and written using the dollar sign as a delimiter ($ABCDEF$) with double dollar-signs used to enter a true dollar sign ($$$.56$ is 56 cents). Strings longer than six characters are represented using arrays. Arrays and matrices * There is no limit on the number of dimensions. * Negative and zero as well as floating-point subscripts are allowed. * Matrices are storied in consecutive memory locations in the order determined by varying the rightmost subscript first. * Matrices may be referenced using a subscript for each dimension, NAME(s1,s2,s3), or using a single subscript, NAME(s1). * Input-output lists, VECTOR VALUES statements, and some subroutines allow the use of block notation, which has the form A,...,B or A...B, which is a reference to the entire region from A to B. inclusive. In terms of a vector, A(1)...A(N) would be A(1), A(2), A(3), ..., A(N). * There are facilities that allow changing dimensions at run-time; permitting the programmer to vary the location of the initial element in an array within the overall block which has been set aside for the array; and allowing an arbitrary storage mapping to be specified.

Internal and external functions are supported. Internal functions are compiled as part of the program in which they are used and share declarations and variables with the main program. External functions are compiled separately and do not share declarations and variables. A one statement definition of internal functions is permitted. Recursive functions are permitted, although the function must do some of the required saving and restoring work itself. * INTERNAL FUNCTION function-name.(argument-list) = expression (single statement definition) * INTERNAL FUNCTION function- name.(argument-list) * EXTERNAL FUNCTION function-name.(argument-list) * ENTRY TO NAME name. * END OF FUNCTION (last statement in a multiple line definition) * FUNCTION RETURN [ expression ] * ERROR RETURN (force an error return to a statement or to the operating system, if no error statement is given as last argument of the call) * SAVE RETURN * RESTORE DATA * RESTORE RETURN * EXECUTE procedure.(argument-list) (call a non-single valued function)  Operator definition and redefinition  One of the most interesting features in MAD is the ability to extend the language by redefining existing operators, defining new operators, or defining new data types (modes). The definitions are made using MAD declaration statements and assembly language mnemonics included following the declaration up to the END pseudo-instruction that implement the operation. * DEFINE BINARY OPERATOR defined-op, PRECEDENCE rank existing-op MODE STRUCTURE mode-options * DEFINE UNARY OPERATOR defined-op, PRECEDENCE rank existing-op MODE STRUCTURE mode-options * MODE STRUCTURE mode-no = mode- no existing-op mode-no * MODE STRUCTURE mode-no = mode-no existing-op mode-no SAME SEQUENCE AS mode-no existing-op mode-no where: * rank is one of SAME AS, LOWER THAN, or HIGHER THAN; and * mode-options are the options that appear on the MODE STRUCTURE statement.

ALGOL 58 dialect Procedural programming languages Programming languages created in 1959 ","title":"MAD (programming language)"},{"id":"55584","text":"Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly, reaching maximal intensity in less than 12 hours. The joint at the base of the big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or kidney damage. Gout is due to persistently elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs from a combination of diet, other health problems, and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who regularly drink beer or sugar-sweetened beverages or who eat foods that are high in purines such as liver, shellfish, or anchovies, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by the presence of crystals in the joint fluid or in a deposit outside the joint. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once the acute attack subsides, levels of uric acid can be lowered via lifestyle changes and in those with frequent attacks, allopurinol or probenecid provides long-term prevention. Taking vitamin C and eating a diet high in low-fat dairy products may be preventive. Gout affects about 1 to 2% of the Western population at some point in their lives. It has become more common in recent decades. This is believed to be due to increasing risk factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy, and changes in diet. Older males are most commonly affected. Gout was historically known as \\"the disease of kings\\" or \\"rich man's disease\\". It has been recognized at least since the time of the ancient Egyptians. Signs and symptoms Gout presenting as slight redness in the metatarsal‚Äìphalangeal joint of the big toe Gout can present in multiple ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal- phalangeal joint at the base of the big toe is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists, and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins during the night and peaks within 24 hours of onset. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever. Long-standing elevated uric acid levels (hyperuricemia) may result in other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy. Cause The crystallization of uric acid, often related to relatively high levels in the blood, is the underlying cause of gout. This can occur because of diet, genetic predisposition, or underexcretion of urate, the salts of uric acid. Underexcretion of uric acid by the kidney is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90% of cases, while overproduction is the cause in less than 10%. About 10% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes. The risk, however, varies depending on the degree of hyperuricemia. When levels are between 415 and 530 Œºmol/l (7 and 8.9 mg/dl), the risk is 0.5% per year, while in those with a level greater than 535 Œºmol/l (9 mg/dL), the risk is 4.5% per year. Lifestyle Dietary causes account for about 12% of gout, and include a strong association with the consumption of alcohol, sugar-sweetened beverages, meat, and seafood. Among foods richest in purines yielding high amounts of uric acid are dried anchovies, shrimp, organ meat, dried mushrooms, seaweed, and beer yeast. Chicken and potatoes also appear related. Other triggers include physical trauma and surgery. Studies in the early 2000s found that other dietary factors are not relevant. Specifically, a diet with moderate purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) is not associated with gout. Neither is total dietary protein. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with increased risk, with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits. Eating skim milk powder enriched with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and G600 milk fat extract may reduce pain but may result in diarrhea and nausea. Physical fitness, healthy weight, low-fat dairy products, and to a lesser extent, coffee and taking vitamin C, appear to decrease the risk of gout; however, taking vitamin C supplements does not appear to have a significant effect in people who already have established gout. Peanuts, brown bread, and fruit also appear protective. This is believed to be partly due to their effect in reducing insulin resistance. Genetics Gout is partly genetic, contributing to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12, and ABCG2 genes have been found to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of- function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 causes low blood uric acid levels by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch‚ÄìNyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout. Medical conditions Gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants, and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Medication Diuretics have been associated with attacks of gout, but a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide. Pathophysiology Chemical structure of uric acid Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate, precipitating and forming deposits (tophi) in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues. Microscopic tophi may be walled off by a ring of proteins, which blocks interaction of the crystals with cells and therefore avoids inflammation. Naked crystals may break out of walled-off tophi due to minor physical damage to the joint, medical or surgical stress, or rapid changes in uric acid levels. When they break through the tophi, they trigger a local immune- mediated inflammatory reaction in macrophages, which is initiated by the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome recruits the enzyme caspase 1, which converts pro-interleukin 1Œ≤ into active interleukin 1Œ≤, one of the key proteins in the inflammatory cascade. An evolutionary loss of urate oxidase (uricase), which breaks down uric acid, in humans and higher primates has made this condition common. The triggers for precipitation of uric acid are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy and diuretics. The starting or increasing of urate-lowering medications can lead to an acute attack of gout with febuxostat of a particularly high risk. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension. Diagnosis Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic acute arthritis of the base of the great toe (known as podagra). Synovial fluid analysis should be done if the diagnosis is in doubt. Plain X-rays are usually normal and are not useful for confirming a diagnosis of early gout. They may show signs of chronic gout such as bone erosion. Synovial fluid A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or a tophus. All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed inflamed joints by arthrocentesis should be examined for these crystals. Under polarized light microscopy, they have a needle-like morphology and strong negative birefringence. This test is difficult to perform and requires a trained observer. The fluid must be examined relatively soon after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect solubility. Blood tests Hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout, but nearly half of the time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the diagnostic utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 Œºmol/l (7.0 mg/dl) in males and 360 Œºmol/l (6.0 mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0√ó109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented. Differential diagnosis The most important differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.

Note also the soft tissue swelling at the lateral border of the foot. Prevention Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of purine-rich foods of animal origin such as meat and seafood, alcohol, and fructose (especially high fructose corn syrup). Eating dairy products, vitamin C, coffee, and cherries may help prevent gout attacks, as does losing weight. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea via the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of apnea can lessen the occurrence of attacks. Medications As of 2020 allopurinol is generally the recommended preventative treatment if medications are used. A number of other medications may occasionally be considered to prevent further episodes of gout, including probenecid, febuxostat, benzbromarone, and colchicine. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first three to six months. While it has been recommended that urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300‚Äì360 ¬µmol/l (5.0‚Äì6.0 mg/dl), there is little evidence to support this practice over simple putting people on a standard dose of allopurinol. If these medications are in chronic use at the time of an attack, it is recommended that they be continued. Levels that cannot be brought below 6.0 mg/dl while attacks continue indicates refractory gout. While historically it is not recommended to start allopurinol during an acute attack of gout, this practice appears acceptable. Allopurinol blocks uric acid production, and is the most commonly used agent. Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones, although hypersensitivity occurs in a small number of individuals. Febuxostat is only recommended in those who cannot tolerate allopurinol. There are concerns about more deaths with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. Febuxostat may also increase the rate of gout flares during early treatment. However, there is tentative evidence that febuxostat may bring down urate levels more than allopurinol. Probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol and is a second line agent. Probenecid may be used if undersecretion of uric acid is present (24-hour urine uric acid less than 800 mg). It is, however, not recommended if a person has a history of kidney stones. Pegloticase is an option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. It is a third line agent. Pegloticase is given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, and reduces uric acid levels. Pegloticase is useful decreasing tophi but has a high rate of side effects and many people develop resistance to it. Potential side effects include kidney stones, anemia and joint pain. In 2016 it was withdrawn from the European market. Lesinurad reduces blood uric acid levels by preventing uric acid absorption in the kidneys. It was approved in the United States for use together with allopurinol, among those who were unable to reach their uric acid level targets. Side effects include kidney problems and kidney stones. Treatment The initial aim of treatment is to settle the symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by medications that reduce serum uric acid levels. Tentative evidence supports the application of ice for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day to decrease pain. Options for acute treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and steroids. While steroids and NSAIDs work equally well, steroids may be safer. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of associated health problems is also important. Lifestyle interventions have been poorly studied. It is unclear whether dietary supplements have an effect in people with gout. NSAIDs NSAIDs are the usual first-line treatment for gout. No specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within four hours and treatment is recommended for one to two weeks. They are not recommended for those with certain other health problems, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney failure, or heart failure. While indometacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, an alternative, such as ibuprofen, may be preferred due to its better side effect profile in the absence of superior effectiveness. For those at risk of gastric side effects from NSAIDs, an additional proton pump inhibitor may be given. There is some evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may work as well as nonselective NSAIDs for acute gout attack with fewer side effects. Colchicine Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and erythromycin, among others. Steroids Glucocorticoids have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition. There were no short-term adverse effects reported. Others Interleukin-1 inhibitors, such as canakinumab, showed moderate effectiveness for pain relief and reduction of joint swelling, but have increased risk of adverse events, such as back pain, headache, and increased blood pressure. They, however, may work less well than usual doses of NSAIDS. The high cost of this class of drugs may also discourage their use for treating gout. Prognosis Without treatment, an acute attack of gout usually resolves in five to seven days; however, 60% of people have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent. Without treatment, episodes of acute gout may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.

Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout include age, race, and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%. In the United States, gout is twice as likely in males of African descent than those of European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the MƒÅori, but the disease is rare in aboriginal Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature. History Antonie van Leeuwenhoek described the microscopic appearance of uric acid crystals in 1679. The term \\"gout\\" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word gutta, meaning \\"a drop\\" (of liquid). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and \\"the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints\\". Gout has been known since antiquity. Historically, it was referred to as \\"the king of diseases and the disease of kings\\" or \\"rich man's disease\\". The Ebers papyrus and the Edwin Smith papyrus, (circa 1550 BC) each mention arthritis of the first metacarpophalangeal joint as a distinct type of arthritis. These ancient manuscripts cite (now missing) Egyptian texts about gout that are claimed to have been written 1,000 years earlier by Imhotep.Schwartz, Stephan A. \\"Disease of distinction.\\" Explore 2, no. 6 (2006): 515-519. Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 BC commented on it in his Aphorisms, noting its absence in eunuchs and premenopausal women. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 AD) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women and associated kidney problems: > Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and > disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera...

Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod identified excess uric acid in the blood as the cause of gout. Other animals Gout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid. Humans and other great apes do not have this ability; thus, gout is common. Other animals with uricase include fish, amphibians and most non-primate mammals. The Tyrannosaurus rex specimen known as \\"Sue\\" is believed to have suffered from gout. Research A number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid, but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available but its use is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.

Enacted by the Democrats, it made substantial cuts in the high rates of the \\"Black Tariff\\" of 1842, enacted by the Whigs. It was based on a report by Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker. The Walker Tariff reduced tariff rates from 32% to 25%. Coinciding with Britain's repeal of the Corn Laws, it led to an increase in trade and was one of the lowest tariffs in American history. Adoption Democrat James Polk was elected President in 1844 over Henry Clay, a Whig who advocated a high tariff. President Polk declared that reduction of the \\"Black Tariff\\" would be the first of the \\"four great measures\\" that would define his administration. He directed Walker to work out the details. In 1846, Polk delivered Walker's tariff proposal to Congress. Walker urged its adoption to increase commerce between the US and Britain. He also predicted that a reduction in tariff rates would stimulate trade, including imports. The result, asserted Walker, would be a net increase in customs revenue, despite the reduced rates. Congress, then controlled by Democrats, acted quickly on Walker's recommendations. Southern Democrats, who had little industry in their states, were especially supportive. The Walker Tariff produced the nation's first standardized tariff: rather than setting fixed rates for specific items on a case-by-case basis, it established general schedules into which all goods could be classified, subject to defined ad valorem rates. The bill reduced rates across the board on most major import items save luxury goods, such as tobacco and alcoholic beverages. Impact The bill made moderate reductions in many tariff rates. As Walker had predicted, trade increased substantially, and net revenue collected also increased, from $30 million annually under the Black Tariff in 1845 to almost $45 million annually by 1850. It also improved relations with Britain that had soured over the Oregon boundary dispute. It was passed along with a series of financial reforms proposed by Walker including the Warehousing Act of 1846. The 1846 tariff rates initiated a fourteen-year period of relative free trade by nineteenth century standards lasting until the high Morrill Tariff of 1861. The Walker Tariff remained in effect until the Tariff of 1857, which used it as a base and reduced rates further. The 1861 Morril Tariff raised the effective rate collected on dutiable imports by approximately 70%. Customs revenue from tariffs totaled $345 million from 1861 through 1865.

The Seneca Falls Convention was the first women's rights convention.Dumenil, 2012, p. 56, which says, \\"The exclusion of women delegates from the London [anti- slavery] convention in 1840 had a decided impact on the events that led to the first women's rights convention, held in Seneca Falls, New York, eight years later‚Ä¶ Well before the 1848 convention, reformers had agitated for improved economic and legal rights for women\\". Other scholarly sources that describe Seneca Falls as \\"the first women's rights convention\\" include Wellman, 2004 (the book's title itself include those words); Isenberg, 1998, p. 1; and McMillen, 2008, p. 115. No scholarly source describes an earlier meeting as a \\"women's rights convention\\". Bonnie S. Anderson, in Joyous Greeting: The First International Women's Movement 1830‚Äì1860, Oxford University Press, 2000, makes no mention of an earlier convention in Europe or elsewhere. The Seneca Falls convention was the first that was organized by women explicitly for the purpose of discussing women's rights as such. It was not, however, the first convention at which women's rights were among the topics that were discussed: * The Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women in 1837 held in New York City, defended the right of women to speak out on the great issues of the day and specifically in opposition to slavery. In June 1848, two other conventions included a discussion of the rights of women: * The Conference of Badasht in Persia, a foundational meeting of the B√°b√≠ religion at which T√°hirih advocated women's rights, supported by Qudd√∫s and the standards set were endorsed by the B√°b and Bah√°'u'llah which became norms in the Bah√°'√≠ Faith and echo still in Persian culture, * and the National Liberty Party Convention in New York at which Gerrit Smith said that women should be able to vote. It advertised itself as \\"a convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\\".Wellman, 2004, p. 189https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/report-of-the-womans-rights- convention.htm Held in the Wesleyan Chapel of the town of Seneca Falls, New York, it spanned two days over July 19‚Äì20, 1848. Attracting widespread attention, it was soon followed by other women's rights conventions, including the Rochester Women's Rights Convention in Rochester, New York, two weeks later. In 1850 the first in a series of annual National Women's Rights Conventions met in Worcester, Massachusetts. Female Quakers local to the area organized the meeting along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was not a Quaker. They planned the event during a visit to the area by Philadelphia-based Lucretia Mott. Mott, a Quaker, was famous for her oratorical ability, which was rare for non-Quaker women during an era in which women were often not allowed to speak in public. The meeting comprised six sessions including a lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions about the role of women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to be debated and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many ‚Äì including Mott ‚Äì urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women. The convention was seen by some of its contemporaries, including featured speaker Mott, as one important step among many others in the continuing effort by women to gain for themselves a greater proportion of social, civil and moral rights,McMillen, 2008, p. 102, while it was viewed by others as a revolutionary beginning to the struggle by women for complete equality with men. Stanton considered the Seneca Falls Convention to be the beginning of the women's rights movement, an opinion that was echoed in the History of Woman Suffrage, which Stanton co-wrote. The convention's Declaration of Sentiments became \\"the single most important factor in spreading news of the women's rights movement around the country in 1848 and into the future\\", according to Judith Wellman, a historian of the convention.Wellman, 2004, p. 192 By the time of the National Women's Rights Convention of 1851, the issue of women's right to vote had become a central tenet of the United States women's rights movement.Buhle, 1978 p. 90 These conventions became annual events until the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Background Reform movement In the decades leading up to 1848, a small number of women began to push against restrictions imposed upon them by society. A few men aided in this effort. In 1831, Reverend Charles Grandison Finney began allowing women to pray aloud in gatherings of men and women.Isenberg, 1998, pp. 5‚Äì6. The Second Great Awakening was challenging women's traditional roles in religion. Recalling the era in 1870, Paulina Wright Davis set Finney's decision as the beginning of the American women's reform movement. Women in abolition Starting in 1832, abolitionist and journalist William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which encouraged the full participation of women. Garrison's ideas were not welcomed by a majority of other abolitionists, and those unwilling to include women split from him to form other abolitionist societies. A few women began to gain fame as writers and speakers on the subject of abolition. In the 1830s, Lydia Maria Child wrote to encourage women to write a will,Higginson, Thomas Wentworth; Meyer, Howard N. The magnificent activist, Da Capo Press, 2000, p. 143. and Frances Wright wrote books on women's rights and social reform. The Grimk√© sisters published their views against slavery in the late 1830s, and they began speaking to mixed gatherings of men and women for Garrison's American Anti-Slavery Society, as did Abby Kelley. Although these women lectured primarily on the evils of slavery, the fact that a woman was speaking in public was itself a noteworthy stand for the cause of women's rights. Ernestine Rose began lecturing in 1836 to groups of women on the subject of the \\"Science of Government\\" which included the enfranchisement of women.Buhle, 1978, p. 64. James and Lucretia Mott In 1840, at the urging of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton traveled with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that the motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to speak or vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns. In 1842 Thomas M'Clintock and his wife Mary Ann became founding members of the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society and helped write its constitution. When he moved to Rochester in 1847, Frederick Douglass joined Amy and Isaac Post and the M'Clintocks in this Rochester-based chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Women's rights In 1839 in Boston, Margaret Fuller began hosting conversations, akin to French salons, among women interested in discussing the \\"great questions\\" facing their sex.Marshall, Megan. The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005: 387. Sophia Ripley was one of the participants. In 1845, Fuller published The Great Lawsuit, asking women to claim themselves as self-dependent. In the 1840s, women in America were reaching out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 as an attempt to find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.Hankins, 2004, p. 34. In the fall of 1841, Elizabeth Cady Stanton gave her first public speech, on the subject of the Temperance movement, in front of 100 women in Seneca Falls. She wrote to her friend Elizabeth J. Neal that she moved both the audience and herself to tears, saying \\"I infused into my speech a Homeopathic dose of woman's rights, as I take good care to do in many private conversations.\\"Stanton, 1997, p. 25. Lucretia Mott met with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Boston in 1842, and discussed again the possibility of a woman's rights convention.Wellman, 2004, p. 188 They talked once more in 1847, prior to Stanton moving from Boston to Seneca Falls. Women's groups led by Lucretia Mott and Paulina Wright Davis held public meetings in Philadelphia beginning in 1846. A wide circle of abolitionists friendly to women's rights began in 1847 to discuss the possibility of holding a convention wholly devoted to women's rights. In October 1847, Lucy Stone gave her first public speech on the subject of women's rights, entitled The Province of Women, at her brother Bowman Stone's church in Gardner, Massachusetts.Emerson, Dorothy May; Edwards, June; Knox, Helene. Standing Before Us, Skinner House Books, 2000, p. 32. In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster and others hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, to work toward the elimination of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee,Anti-Sabbath Convention. Proceedings of the Anti-Sabbath Convention, Retrieved on April 23, 2009. and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott raised questions about the validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.Isenberg, 1998, pp. 87‚Äì88. Political gains On April 7, 1848, in response to a citizen's petition, the New York State Assembly passed the Married Woman's Property Act, giving women the right to retain the property they brought into a marriage, as well as property they acquired during the marriage. Creditors could not seize a wife's property to pay a husband's debts. Leading up to the passage of this law, in 1846, supporters issued a pamphlet, probably authored by Judge John Fine,Historynow.org. Judith Wellman. The Seneca Falls Convention: Setting the National Stage for Women's Suffrage, Retrieved April 27, 2009. which relied on its readers' familiarity with the United States Declaration of Independence to demand \\"That all are created free and equal ...\\", and that this idea should apply equally to the sexes. \\"Women, as well as men, are entitled to the full enjoyment of its practical blessings\\". A group of 44 married women of western New York wrote to the Assembly in March 1848, saying \\"your Declaration of Independence declares, that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. And as women have never consented to, been represented in, or recognized by this government, it is evident that in justice no allegiance can be claimed from them ... Our numerous and yearly petitions for this most desirable object having been disregarded, we now ask your august body, to abolish all laws which hold married women more accountable for their acts than infants, idiots, and lunatics.\\" Gerrit Smith made woman suffrage a plank in the Liberty Party platform on June 14‚Äì15, 1848. The General Assembly in Pennsylvania passed a similar married woman's property law a few weeks later, one which Lucretia Mott and others had championed. These progressive state laws were seen by American women as a sign of new hope for women's rights.McMillen, 2008, p. 81. On June 2, 1848 in Rochester, New York, Gerrit Smith was nominated as the Liberty Party's presidential candidate. Smith was Elizabeth Cady Stanton's first cousin, and the two enjoyed debating and discussing political and social issues with each other whenever he came to visit.Wellman, 2004, p. 176. Judith Wellman offers the theory that Gerrit Smith and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, during a possible visit by Smith to Seneca Falls between June 2 and June 14, 1848, challenged or encouraged each other to introduce women's voting rights in their separate political and social spheres, as both subsequently did so, Smith taking the first shot. At the National Liberty Convention, held June 14‚Äì15 in Buffalo, New York, Smith gave a major address,Claflin, Alta Blanche. Political parties in the United States 1800-1914, New York Public Library, 1915, p. 50 including in his speech a demand for \\"universal suffrage in its broadest sense, females as well as males being entitled to vote.\\" The delegates approved a passage in their party platform addressing votes for women: \\"Neither here, nor in any other part of the world, is the right of suffrage allowed to extend beyond one of the sexes. This universal exclusion of woman ... argues, conclusively, that, not as yet, is there one nation so far emerged from barbarism, and so far practically Christian, as to permit woman to rise up to the one level of the human family.\\" At this convention, five votes were placed calling for Lucretia Mott to be Smith's vice-president‚Äîthe first time in the United States that a woman was suggested for federal executive office. Quaker influence Many members of the Religious Society of Friends, known as Quakers, made their homes in western New York state, near Seneca Falls. A particularly progressive branch lived in and around Waterloo in Seneca County, New York. These Quakers strove for marital relationships in which men and women worked and lived in equality.National Park Service. Women's Rights. Quaker Influence. Retrieved on April 23, 2009. The M'Clintocks came to Waterloo from a Quaker community in Philadelphia. They rented property from Richard P. Hunt, a wealthy Quaker and businessman. The M'Clintock and Hunt families opposed slavery; both participated in the free produce movement, and their houses served as stations on the Underground Railroad. Though women Friends had since the 1660s publicly preached, written and led, and traditional Quaker tenets held that men and women were equals, Quaker women met separately from the men to consider and decide a congregation's business. By the 1840s, some Hicksite Quakers determined to bring women and men together in their business meetings as an expression of their spiritual equality. In June 1848, approximately 200 Hicksites, including the Hunts and the M'Clintocks, formed an even more radical Quaker group, known as the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends, or Progressive Friends. The Progressive Friends intended to further elevate the influence of women in affairs of the faith. They introduced joint business meetings of men and women, giving women an equal voice. Planning Lucretia and James Mott visited central and western New York in the summer of 1848 for a number of reasons, including visiting the Cattaraugus Reservation of the Seneca Nation and former slaves living in the province of Ontario, Canada. Mott was present at the meeting in which the Progressive Friends left the Hicksite Quakers. They also visited Lucretia's sister Martha Coffin Wright in Auburn, NY, where Mott also preached to prisoners at the Auburn State Penitentiary. Lucretia Mott's skill and fame as an orator drew crowds wherever she went. Announcement Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1848 with two of her three sons After Quaker worship on Sunday July 9, 1848, Lucretia Coffin Mott joined Mary Ann M'Clintock, Martha Coffin Wright (Mott's witty sister, several months pregnant),National Park Service.

Over tea, Stanton, the only non-Quaker present, vented a lifetime's worth of pent-up frustration, her \\"long-accumulating discontent\\"Stanton, 1881 about women's subservient place in society. The five women decided to hold a women's rights convention in the immediate future, while the Motts were still in the area, and drew up an announcement to run in the Seneca County Courier. The announcement began with these words: \\"WOMAN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION.‚ÄîA Convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of woman\\". The notice specified that only women were invited to the first day's meetings on July 19, but both women and men could attend on the second day to hear Lucretia Mott speak, among others. On July 11, the announcement first appeared, giving readers just eight days' notice until the first day of convention.National Park Service. Women's Rights. Jane Hunt. Retrieved on April 24, 2009.

Women's Rights. Wesleyan Chapel. Retrieved on April 24, 2009. in Seneca Falls. Built by a congregation of abolitionists and financed in part by Richard Hunt, the chapel had been the scene of many reform lectures, and was considered the only large building in the area that would open its doors to a women's rights convention. Declaration, grievances, resolutions At their home in Waterloo on Sunday, July 16, the M'Clintocks hosted a smaller planning session for the convention. Mary Ann M'Clintock and her eldest daughters, Elizabeth and Mary Ann, Jr., discussed with Stanton the makeup of the resolutions that would be presented to the convention for approval. Each woman made certain her concerns were appropriately represented among the ten resolutions that they composed.Stanton, 1922, p. 146. Taken together, the resolutions demanded that women should have equality in the family, education, jobs, religion, and morals. One of the M'Clintock women selected the Declaration of Independence from 1776 as a model for the declaration they wanted to make at their convention. The Declaration of Sentiments was then drafted in the parlor on a round, three-legged, mahogany tea table.Smithsonian Institution. National Museum of American History. Declaration of Sentiments table, 1848. Retrieved on April 24, 2009. Stanton changed a few words of the Declaration of Independence to make it appropriate for a statement by women, replacing \\"The history of the present King of Great Britain\\" with \\"The history of mankind\\" as the basis for \\"usurpations on the part of man toward woman.\\" The women added the phrase \\"and women\\" to make \\"... all men and women are created equal ...\\"National Park Service. Women's Rights. Declaration of Sentiments. Retrieved on April 24, 2009. A list of grievances was composed to form the second part of the Declaration.Wellman, 2004, p. 192 Between July 16 and July 19, at home on her own writing desk, Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, politician and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating \\"extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests.\\" On her own, Stanton added a more radical point to the list of grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights. To the grievances, she added \\"He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise\\", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of \\"the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation ...\\"Wellman, 2004, p. 193. Stanton's use of the word 'never' was incorrect: prior to 1848, women had voted in certain times and places. Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife \\"you will turn the proceedings into a farce.\\"McMillen, 2008, p. 93. He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause.Mani, 2007, p. 98. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.McMillen, 2008, p. 90. On July 16, Lucretia Mott sent a note to Stanton apologizing in advance for James Mott not being able to attend the first day, as he was feeling \\"quite unwell\\".Stanton, 1997, p. 22. Lucretia Mott wrote to say she would bring her sister, Martha Wright, and that the two women would participate in both days of the convention.Wellman, 2004, p. 191. First day On July 19, 1848, the morning of the first day of convention, the organizing committee arrived at the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel shortly before ten o'clock on a hot, sunny day to find a crowd gathered outside and the church doors locked‚Äîan overlooked detail. Stanton's young nephew Daniel was lifted through an open window so that he could unbar the doors from the inside. Even though the first session had been announced as being exclusively for women, some young children of both sexes had been brought by their mothers, and about 40 men were there expecting to attend. The men were not turned away, but were asked to remain silent. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., 26 years old, was appointed secretary, to take notes. Morning session Lucretia Mott was described as \\"the moving spirit of the occasion\\". Starting at 11 o'clock, Elizabeth Cady Stanton spoke first, exhorting each woman in the audience to accept responsibility for her own life, and to \\"understand the height, the depth, the length, and the breadth of her own degradation.\\" Lucretia Mott then spoke, encouraging all to take up the cause. Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments in its entirety, then re-read each paragraph so that it could be discussed at length, and changes incorporated. The question of whether men's signatures would be sought for the Declaration was discussed, with the vote looking favorable for including men, but the motion was tabled until the following day when men themselves could participate.Wellman, 2004, p. 195. The first session adjourned at 2:30 p.m.McMillen, 2008, p. 91. Afternoon session After a pause for refreshment in the 90¬∞ heat, an afternoon session began with Stanton and then Mott addressing the audience. The Declaration of Sentiments was read again and more changes were made to it. The resolutions, now numbering eleven with Stanton's addition of women's suffrage, were read aloud and discussed. Lucretia Mott read a humorous newspaper piece written by her sister Martha Wright in which Wright questioned why, after an overworked mother completed the myriad daily tasks that were required of her but not of her husband, she was the one upon whom written advice was \\"so lavishly bestowed.\\"McMillen, 2008, p. 92. Twenty-seven-year-old Elizabeth W. M'Clintock then delivered a speech, and the first day's business was called to a close. Evening speech In the evening, the meeting was opened to all persons, and Lucretia Mott addressed a large audience.National Reformer, Auburn, Thursday, August 3, 1848. Woman's Rights Convention. Retrieved on April 27, 2009. She spoke of the progress of other reform movements and so framed for her listeners the social and moral context for the struggle for women's rights. She asked the men present to help women gain the equality they deserved. The editor of the National Reformer, a paper in Auburn, New York, reported that Mott's extemporaneous evening speech was \\"one of the most eloquent, logical, and philosophical discourses which we ever listened to.\\" Second day A larger crowd attended on the second day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late and took a seat in the upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as chair in front of both men and women. Morning session, day two After Mott opened the meeting, the minutes of the previous day were read, and Stanton presented the Declaration of Sentiments. In regard to the grievance \\"He has taken from her all right in property, even to the wages she earns,\\" Assemblyman Ansel Bascom stood to say that he had recently been at the New York State Assembly which passed the Married Woman's Property Act. Bascom spoke at length about the property rights it secured for married women, including property acquired after marriage. Further discussion of the Declaration ensued, including comments by Frederick Douglass, Thomas and Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Amy Post; the document was adopted unanimously.National Park Service.

The National Reformer reported that those in the audience who evidently regarded the Declaration as \\"too bold and ultra\\", including the lawyers known to be opposed to the equal rights of women, \\"failed to call out any opposition, except in a neighboring BAR-ROOM.\\" Afternoon session, day two Frederick Douglass stood up to speak in favor of women's right to vote. At the afternoon session, the eleven resolutions were read again, and each one was voted on individually. The only one that was materially questioned was the ninth, the one Stanton had added regarding women's right to vote. It read: Those who opposed this resolution argued that its presence would cause the other, more rational resolutions to lose support.Buhle, 1978 p. 97. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, \\"Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous.\\" Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would then be able to affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting,Stanton, 1997, p. 85. stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if women could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. \\"In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world.\\"McMillen, 2008, pp. 93‚Äì94. Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.

Lucretia Mott stood to offer another resolution: \\"Resolved, That the speedy success of our cause depends upon the zealous and untiring efforts of both men and women, for the overthrow of the monopoly of the pulpit, and for the securing to woman an equal participation with men in the various trades, professions and commerce.\\"Stanton, 1997, p. 83. This, the twelfth resolution, passed. Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr. spoke briefly, calling upon woman to arouse from her lethargy and be true to herself and her God. Douglass again rose to speak in support of the cause of woman. Lucretia Mott spoke for an hour with one of her \\"most beautiful and spiritual appeals\\". Although Lucretia Mott's reputation as a speaker drew the audience, Mott recognized Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mary Ann M'Clintock as the \\"chief planners and architects\\" of the convention. To close the meeting, a committee was appointed to edit and publish the convention proceedings, with Amy Post, Eunice Newton Foote, Mary Ann M'Clintock, Jr., Elizabeth W. M'Clintock and Stanton serving. Afterward News reports Local newspapers printed reports of the convention, some positive, others not. The National Reformer reported that the convention \\"forms an era in the progress of the age; it being the first convention of the kind ever held, and one whose influence shall not cease until woman is guaranteed all the rights now enjoyed by the other half of creation‚ÄîSocial, Civil and POLITICAL.\\" The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: \\"This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity.

Soon, newspapers across the country picked up the story. Reactions varied widely. In Massachusetts, the Lowell Courier published its opinion that, with women's equality, \\"the lords must wash the dishes, scour up, be put to the tub, handle the broom, darn stockings.\\" In St. Louis, Missouri, the Daily Reveille trumpeted that \\"the flag of independence has been hoisted for the second time on this side of the Atlantic.\\" Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune wrote \\"When a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give, for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. However unwise and mistaken the demand, it is but the assertion of a natural right, and such must be conceded.\\" Religious reaction Some of the ministers heading congregations in the area attended the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw the actions of the ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, no one would be allowed to reply.McMillen, 2008, p. 98. Further conventions Signers of the Declaration of Sentiments hoped for \\"a series of Conventions, embracing every part of the country\\" to follow their own meeting. Because of the fame and drawing power of Lucretia Mott, who would not be staying in the Upstate New York area for much longer, some of the participants at Seneca Falls organized the Rochester Women's Rights Convention two weeks later in Rochester, New York with Lucretia Mott as its featured speaker. Unlike the Seneca Falls convention, the Rochester convention took the controversial step of electing a woman, Abigail Bush, as its presiding officer.

The Women's Rights National Historical Park was established in 1980, and covers a total of 6.83 acres (27,600 m¬≤) of land in Seneca Falls and nearby Waterloo, New York, USA. The park consists of four major historical properties, including the Wesleyan Methodist Church, which was the site of the Seneca Falls Convention, Elizabeth Cady Stanton's home, and the M'Clintock House, which was where the Declaration of Sentiments, resolutions, and speeches were drawn up for the Seneca Falls Convention. The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the M'Clintock House were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In 1998 First Lady Hillary Clinton gave a speech on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. Historiography In 1870, Paulina Wright Davis authored a history of the antebellum women's rights movement, The History of the National Woman's Rights Movement, and received approval of her account from many of the involved suffragists including Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Davis' version gave the Seneca Falls meeting in 1848 a minor role, equivalent to other local meetings that had been held by women's groups in the late 1840s. Davis set the beginning of the national and international women's rights movement at Worcester, Massachusetts in 1850, at the National Women's Rights Convention when women from many states were invited, the influence of which was felt across the continent and in Great Britain. Stanton seemed to agree; in an address to the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) convention in 1870, on the subject of the women's rights movement, she said \\"The movement in England, as in America, may be dated from the first National Convention, held at Worcester, Mass., October, 1850.\\"Worcester Women's History Project. Why Commemorate the 1850 Woman's Rights Convention?, Retrieved on May 1, 2009. In 1876, in the spirit of the nation's centennial celebrations, Stanton and Susan B. Anthony decided to write a more expansive history of the women's rights movement. They invited Lucy Stone to help, but Stone declined to be part of the project; she was of the opinion that Stanton and Anthony would not fairly portray the divisive split between NWSA and American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Stanton and Anthony wrote without her and, in 1881, they published the first volume of the History of Woman Suffrage, and placed themselves at each of its most important events, marginalizing Stone's contribution.Kerr, Andrea Moore, Ph.D. (2002) Lucy Stone and Coy's Hill. The Trustees of Reservations. Archived on September 27, 2007. Retrieved on January 22, 2010. According to Lisa Tetrault, a professor of women's history, the Seneca Falls Convention was central to their rendition of the movement's history. Neither Stanton nor Anthony had been at the 1850 convention, which was associated with their rivals. Stanton, however, had played a key role at the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, at which Stone had not been present. In the early 1870s, Stanton and Anthony began to present Seneca Falls as the beginning of the women's rights movement, an origin story that downplayed Stone's role. Pointing out that the women's rights movement could be said to have begun even earlier than Seneca Falls, Tetrault said the History of Woman Suffrage dealt with these earlier events relatively briefly in its first three chapters, the first of which is titled \\"Preceding Causes.\\"Tetrault (2014), pp. 71, 121, 137. Tetrault says she describes the Seneca Falls story as a \\"myth\\" not to indicate that it is false but in the technical sense of \\"a venerated and celebrated story used to give meaning to the world.\\" See Tetrault (2014), p. 5 In the volume, Stanton did not mention the Liberty Party's plank on woman suffrage pre-dating the Seneca Falls Convention by a month, and she did not describe the Worcester National Women's Rights Convention, organized by Stone and Davis in 1850, as the beginning of the women's rights movement. Rather, Stanton named the 1840 Anti-Slavery Convention in London as the birth of the \\"movement for woman's suffrage, in both England and America\\". She positioned the Seneca Falls meeting as her own political debut, and characterized it as the beginning of the women's rights movement,Isenberg, 1998, pp. 3‚Äì4. which she called \\"the greatest movement for human liberty recorded on the pages of history‚Äîa demand for freedom to one- half the entire race.\\" Stanton worked to enshrine the Declaration of Sentiments as a foundational treatise in a number of ways, not the least of which was by imbuing the small, three-legged tea table upon which the first draft of it was composed with an importance similar to that of Thomas Jefferson's desk upon which he wrote the Declaration of Independence. The M'Clintocks gave Stanton the table, then Stanton gave it to Susan B. Anthony on the occasion of her 80th birthday,Library of Congress. American Memory.

Subsequently, it was displayed prominently on the stage at each of the most important suffrage meetings until 1920, even though the grievance and resolution about woman suffrage was not written on it. The table is kept at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. Lucretia Mott reflected in August 1848 upon the two women's rights conventions in which she had participated that summer, and assessed them no greater than other projects and missions she was involved with. She wrote that the two gatherings were \\"greatly encouraging; and give hope that this long neglected subject will soon begin to receive the attention that its importance demands.\\" Historian Gerda Lerner has pointed out that religious ideas provided a fundamental source for the Declaration of Sentiments. Most of the women attending the convention were active in Quaker or evangelical Methodist movements. The document itself drew from writings by the evangelical Quaker Sarah Grimk√© to make biblical claims that God had created woman equal to man and that man had usurped God's authority by establishing \\"absolute tyranny\\" over woman.Lerner, 1998, pp. 22‚Äì23. According to author Jami Carlacio, Grimk√©'s writings opened the public's eyes to ideas like women's rights, and for the first time they were willing to question conventional notions about the subordination of women.Carlacio, 2002.

It was the twelfth of the seventeen planks in the platform of the incoming Republican Party, which had not yet been inaugurated, and the tariff appealed to industrialists and factory workers as a way to foster rapid industrial growth. It was named for its sponsor, Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, who drafted it with the advice of the Pennsylvania economist Henry Charles Carey. The passage of the tariff was possible because many opponents of the South had resigned from Congress after their states declared their secession from the Union. The tariff rates were raised to encourage domestic industry and to foster high wages for industrial workers. The tariff replaced the lower Tariff of 1857, which, according to Kenneth Stampp, \\"was possible because it did not represent a victory of one section over the other; nor did it produce a clear division between parties. Its supporters included Democrats, Republicans, and members of the American Party; representatives of northern merchants, manufacturers, and railroad interests; and spokesmen for southern farmers and planters. Opposition came largely from two economic groups: the iron manufacturers of Pennsylvania and the wool growers of New England and the West.\\"Kenneth M. Stampp, America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink 1990 p. 19. Two additional tariffs sponsored by Morrill, each higher than the previous one, were passed under President Abraham Lincoln to raise revenue that was urgently needed during the American Civil War. The tariff inaugurated a period of continuous protectionism in the United States, and that policy remained until the adoption of the Revenue Act of 1913, or Underwood Tariff. The schedule of the Morrill Tariff and both of its successors were retained long after the end of the Civil War. History Average American tariff rates (1821-2016) Origins A high tariff to encourage the development of domestic industry had been advocated for many years, especially by the Whig Party and its longtime leader, Henry Clay. Such a tariff was enacted in 1842, but in 1846, the Democratic Party enacted the Walker Tariff, which cut tariff rates substantially. The Democrats cut rates even further in the Tariff of 1857, which was highly favorable to the South. Meanwhile, the Whig Party collapsed, and tariffs taken up by the new Republican Party, which ran its first national ticket in 1856. Some former Whigs from the border states and the Upper South remained in Congress as \\"Opposition,\\" \\"Unionist,\\" or \\"American,\\" (Know Nothing) members and supported higher tariffs. The Panic of 1857 led to calls for protectionist tariff revision. The famous economist Henry C. Carey blamed the panic on the Tariff of 1857. His opinion was widely circulated in the protectionist media for higher tariffs. Efforts to raise the tariffs began in earnest in the 35th Congress of 1857‚Äì1859. Two proposals were submitted in the US House of Representatives. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman John S. Phelps, Democrat from Missouri, wrote the Democrats' plan, which retained most of the low rates of the Tariff of 1857, with minor revisions to stimulate revenue. Ways and Means members Morrill and Henry Winter Davis, a Maryland \\"American,\\" produced the Republican proposal to raise the tariffs. It replaced the existing ad valorem tariff schedule with specific duties and drastically increased tariff rates on goods that were produced by popular \\"protected\\" industries, such as iron, textiles, and other manufactured goods. The economic historian Frank Taussig argued that in many cases, the substitution of specific duties was used to disguise the extent of the rate increases. Supporters of the specific rates argued that they were necessary because European exporters routinely provided US customers with fake invoices showing lower prices for goods than were actually paid. Specific rates made such subterfuge pointless. However, the House took no action on either tariff bill during the 35th Congress. House actions Justin Smith Morrill When the 36th Congress met in 1859, action remained blocked by a dispute until 1860 over who would be elected the Speaker of the House. In 1860, the Republican William Pennington of New Jersey was elected as speaker. Pennington appointed a pro-tariff Republican majority to the Ways and Means Committee, with John Sherman of Ohio its chairman. The Morrill bill was passed out of the Ways and Means Committee. Near the end of first session of the Congress (December 1859‚ÄìJune 1860), on May 10, 1860, the bill was brought up for a floor vote and passed 105-64. The vote was largely but not entirely sectional. Republicans, all from the northern states, voted 89‚Äì2 for the bill. They were joined by 7 northern Democrats from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Five of them were \\"anti-Lecompton Democrats,\\" who opposed the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution for Kansas. Also, 14 northern Democrats voted against the bill. In the Border States, four \\"Opposition\\" Representatives from Kentucky voted for it, as did its cosponsor, Winter of Maryland, a Maryland \\"Unionist,\\" and a Democrat from Delaware. Eight Democrats from the Border States and a member of the American Party from Missouri voted against it. Thirty-five southern Democrats and three Oppositionists voted against it; one Oppositionist from Tennessee voted for it. Thus the sectional breakdown was 96‚Äì15 in the North, 7‚Äì9 in the Border States, and 1‚Äì39 in the South. There were 55 abstentions, including 13 Republicans, 12 northern Democrats, 13 southern Democrats, and 8 southern \\"Oppositionists\\" and \\"Americans.\\" (The remaining Representatives were mostly \\"paired\\" with opposing Representatives who could not be present.Congressional Globe, 36th Congress, 1st Session, p. 2056 Senate action The Morrill bill was sent on to the US Senate. However, the Senate was controlled by Democrats and so it was bottled up in the Finance Committee, chaired by Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia. That ensured that the Senate vote would be put off until the second session in December 1860 and meant that the tariff would be a prominent issue in the 1860 election.Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union; Vol. IV: The Emergence of Lincoln: Prologue to Civil War, 1859‚Äì1861 (1950). 1860 election The Republican Party included a strong pro-tariff plank in its 1860 platform and sent prominent tariff advocates touting the bill, such as Morrill and Sherman, to campaign in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where the tariff was popular. Both Democratic candidates, John C. Breckinridge and Stephen Douglas, opposed all high tariffs and protectionism in general. The historian Reinhard H. Luthin documents the importance of the Morrill Tariff to the Republicans in the 1860 presidential election.Luthin, p. 622 Lincoln's record as a protectionist and support for the Morrill bill, he notes, helped him to secure support in the important state of Pennsylvania and neighboring New Jersey. Lincoln carried Pennsylvania handily in November, as part of his sweep of the North. On February 14, 1861, President-elect Lincoln told an audience in Pittsburgh that he would make a new tariff his priority in the next session if the bill did not pass by his inauguration, on March 4. Renewed Senate action The second session of the 36th Congress began in December 1860. At first, it appeared that Hunter would keep the Morrill bill tabled until the end of the term in March. However, in December 1860 and January 1861, seven southern states seceded, and their low-tariff senators withdrew. Republicans took control of the Senate in February, and Hunter lost his hold on the Finance Committee. Meanwhile, the Treasury was in financial crisis, with less than $500,000 on hand and millions in unpaid bills. The Union urgently needed new revenue. A recent historian concludes that \\"the impetus for revising the tariff arose as an attempt to augment revenue, stave off 'ruin,' and address the accumulating debt.\\"Jane Flaherty, \\"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\\" Civil War History (2009) Volume: 55#2 pp 244 ff. The hostorian Bray Hammond emphasizes the Treasury's \\"empty purse.\\" Bray Hammond, Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War (1970) The Morrill bill was brought to the Senate floor for a vote on February 20 and passed 25 to 14. The vote was split almost completely down party lines. It was supported by 24 Republicans and the Democrat William Bigler of Pennsylvania. It was opposed by 10 Southern Democrats, 2 Northern Democrats, and 2 Far West Democrats. Twelve Senators abstained, including 3 Northern Democrats, 1 California Democrat, 5 Southern Democrats, 2 Republicans, and 1 Unionist from Maryland. There were some minor amendments related to the tariffs on tea and coffee, which required a conference committee with the House, but they were resolved, and the final bill was approved by unanimous consent on March 2. Though a Democrat himself, President James Buchanan favored the bill because of the interests of his home state, Pennsylvania. He signed the bill into law as one of his last acts in office. Adoption and amendments The tariff took effect one month after it was signed into law. Besides setting tariff rates, the bill altered and restricted the Warehousing Act of 1846. The tariff was drafted and passed the House before the Civil War began or was expected, and it was passed by the Senate after seven States had seceded. At least one author has argued that the first Morrill should not be considered \\"Civil War\\" legislation.Taussig wrote, \\"It is clear that the Morrill tariff was carried in the House before any serious expectation of war was entertained; and it was accepted by the Senate in the session of 1861 without material change. It therefore forms no part of the financial legislation of the war, which gave rise in time to a series of measures that entirely superseded the Morrill tariff.\\" The Tariff History of the United States In fact, the tariff proved to be too low for the revenue needs of the Civil War and was quickly raised by the Second Morrill Tariff, or Revenue Act of 1861, later that fall.Taussig Impact In its first year of operation, the Morrill Tariff increased the effective rate collected on dutiable imports by approximately 70%. In 1860, American tariff rates were among the lowest in the world and also at historical lows by 19th-century standards, the average rate for 1857 to 1860 being around 17% overall (ad valorem), 21% on dutiable items only. The Morrill Tariff immediately raised those averages to about 26% overall, or 36% on dutiable items. Further increases by 1865 left the comparable rates at 38% and 48%. Although higher than in the immediate antebellum period, the new rates were still significantly lower than between 1825 and 1830, when rates had sometimes been over 50%.U.S. Tariff Rates - Ratio of Import Duties to Values: 1821-1996 The United States needed $3 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War, over $400 million for 1862 alone. The chief source of revenue had been tariffs. Therefore, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, despite being a longtime free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, which raised rates another 10% to generate more revenue.Richardson, 100, 113 The subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs but enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. However, the tariff played only a modest role in financing the war and was far less important than other measures, such as $2.8 billion in bond sales and some printing of greenbacks. Customs revenue from tariffs totaled $345 million from 1861 to 1865, or 43% of all federal tax revenue, but military spending totaled $3,065 million.Jerry W. Markham, A financial history of the United States (2001) vol 3 p 220 Reception abroad The Morrill Tariff was met with intense hostility in Britain, where free trade dominated public opinion. Southern diplomats and agents sought to use British ire towards the Morrill Tariff to garner sympathy, with the aim of obtaining British recognition for the Confederacy.Marc-William Palen, \\"The Civil War's Forgotten Transatlantic Tariff Debate and the Confederacy's Free Trade Diplomacy,\\" Journal of the Civil War Era 3: 1 (March 2013): 35-61 The new tariff schedule heavily penalized British iron, clothing, and manufactured exports by making them more costly and sparked public outcry from many British politicians. The expectation of high tax rates probably caused British shippers to hasten their deliveries before the new rates took effect in the early summer of 1861. When complaints were heard from London, Congress counterattacked. The Senate Finance Committee chairman snapped, \\"What right has a foreign country to make any question about what we choose to do?\\"Richardson p. 114 When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, British public opinion was sympathetic to the Confederacy, in part because of lingering agitation over the tariff. As one diplomatic historian has explained, the Morrill TariffJohnson p 14 > not unnaturally gave great displeasure to England. It greatly lessened the > profits of the American markets to English manufacturers and merchants, to a > degree which caused serious mercantile distress in that country. Moreover, > the British nation was then in the first flush of enthusiasm over free > trade, and, under the lead of extremists like Cobden and Gladstone, was > inclined to regard a protective tariff as essentially and intrinsically > immoral, scarcely less so than larceny or murder. Indeed, the tariff was > seriously regarded as comparable in offensiveness with slavery itself, and > Englishmen were inclined to condemn the North for the one as much as the > South for the other. \\"We do not like slavery,\\" said Palmerston to Adams, > \\"but we want cotton, and we dislike very much your Morrill tariff.\\" Many prominent British writers condemned the Morrill Tariff in the strongest terms. The economist William Stanley Jevons denounced it as a \\"retrograde\\" law. The famous novelist Charles Dickens used his magazine, All the Year Round, to attack the new tariff. On December 28, 1861 Dickens published a lengthy article, believed to be written by Henry Morley,Unlike the situation with Household Words, no ledger survives giving the authorship of each article in All the Year Round but Dickens scholar Ella Ann Oppenlander has attempted to provide a list in a work that is not easily procured, Dickens's All the Year Round: Descriptive Index and Contributor List (1984). The article that the above quote is from is widely regarded by scholars as a follow-up to an article from a week earlier, American Disunion. Graham Storey in The Letters of Charles Dickens attributes both articles to staff writer Henry Morley, based on a letter by Dickens stating that \\"you say nothing of the book on the American Union in Morley's hands. I hope and trust his article will be ready for the next No. made up. There will not be the least objection to having American papers in it.\\" He afterwards wrote, \\"It is scarcely possible to make less of Mr. Spence's book, than Morley has done.\\" Dickens micromanaged the magazine and so none dispute that Dickens must have generally endorsed the ideas in the articles. which blamed the American Civil War on the Morrill Tariff: > If it be not slavery, where lies the partition of the interests that has led > at last to actual separation of the Southern from the Northern States?... > Every year, for some years back, this or that Southern state had declared > that it would submit to this extortion only while it had not the strength > for resistance.

The communist philosopher Karl Marx was among the few writers in Britain who saw slavery as the major cause of the war. Marx wrote extensively in the British press and served as a London correspondent for several North American newspapers including Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. Marx reacted to those who blamed the war on the Morrill Tariff and argued instead that slavery had induced secession and that the tariff was just a pretext. In October 1861, he wrote: > Naturally, in America everyone knew that from 1846 to 1861 a free trade > system prevailed, and that Representative Morrill carried his protectionist > tariff through Congress only in 1861, after the rebellion had already broken > out. Secession, therefore, did not take place because the Morrill tariff had > gone through Congress, but, at most, the Morrill tariff went through > Congress because secession had taken place.Biographies Legacy According to the historian Heather Cox Richardson, Morrill intended to offer protection to both the usual manufacturing recipients and a broad group of agricultural interests. The purpose was to appease interests beyond the Northeast, which traditionally supported protection. For the first time, protection was extended to every major farm product: > Planning to distribute the benefits of a tariff to all sectors of the > economy, and also hoping to broaden support for his party, Morrill rejected > the traditional system of protection by proposing tariff duties on > agricultural, mining, and fishing products, as well as on manufactures. > Sugar, wool, flaxseed, hides, beef, pork, corn, grain, hemp, wool, and > minerals would all be protected by the Morrill Tariff. The duty on sugar > might well be expected to appease Southerners opposed to tariffs, and, > notably, wool and flaxseed production were growing industries in the West. > The new tariff bill also would protect coal, lead, copper, zinc, and other > minerals, all of which the new northwestern states were beginning to > produce. The Eastern fishing industry would receive a duty on dried, > pickled, and salted fish. \\"In adjusting the details of a tariff,\\" Morrill > explained with a rhetorical flourish in his introduction of the bill, \\"I > would treat agriculture, manufactures, mining, and commerce, as I would our > whole people‚Äîas members of one family, all entitled to equal favor, and no > one to be made the beast of burden to carry the packs of others.\\"Richardson > p. 105 According to Taussig, \\"Morrill and the other supporters of the act of 1861 declared that their intention was simply to restore the rates of 1846.\\" However, he also gives reason to suspect that the bill's motives were intended to put high rates of protection on iron and wool to attract the West and Pennsylvania: > The important change which they (the sponsors) proposed to make from the > provisions of the tariff of 1846 was to substitute specific for ad-valorem > duties. Such a change from ad-valorem to specific duties is in itself by no > means objectionable; but it has usually been made a pretext on the part of > protectionists for a considerable increase in the actual duties paid. When > protectionists make a change of this kind, they almost invariably make the > specific duties higher than the ad-valorem duties for which they are > supposed to be an equivalent.... The Morrill tariff formed no exception to > the usual course of things in this respect. The specific duties which it > established were in many cases considerably above the ad-valorem duties of > 1846. The most important direct changes made by the act of 1861 were in the > increased duties on iron and on wool, by which it was hoped to attach to the > Republican party Pennsylvania and some of the Western States\\"Taussig p. 99 Henry C. Carey, who assisted Morrill in drafting the bill and was one of its most vocal supporters, strongly emphasized its importance to the Republican Party in his January 2, 1861 letter to Lincoln: \\"the success of your administration is wholly dependent upon the passage of the Morrill bill at the present session.\\" According to Carey, > With it, the people will be relieved ‚Äî your term will commence with a rising > wave of prosperity ‚Äî the Treasury will be filled and the party that elected > you will be increased and strengthened. Without it, there will be much > suffering among the people ‚Äî much dissatisfaction with their duties ‚Äî much > borrowing on the part of the Government ‚Äî & very much trouble among the > Republican Party when the people shall come to vote two years hence. There > is but one way to make the Party a permanent one, & that is, by the prompt > repudiation to the free trade system. Representative John Sherman later wrote: > The Morrill tariff bill came nearer than any other to meeting the double > requirement of providing ample revenue for the support of the government and > of rendering the proper protection to home industries. No national taxes, > except duties on imported goods, were imposed at the time of its passage. > The Civil War changed all this, reducing importations and adding tenfold to > the revenue required.

Secession Relation to tariff The Morrill tariff was adopted against the backdrop of the secession movement, and provided an issue for secessionist agitation in some southern states. The law's critics compared it to the 1828 Tariff of Abominations, which sparked the Nullification Crisis, but its average rate was significantly lower. Slavery dominated the secession debate in the southern states,Dew p. 12. For example, Dew notes that in South Carolina the Declaration of Causes adopted by the secession convention \\"focused primarily on the Northern embrace of antislavery principles and the evil designs of the newly triumphant Republican Party\\" and Georgia's convention was \\"equally outspoken on the subject of slavery.\\" but the Morrill Tariff was addressed in the conventions of Georgia and South Carolina. Robert Barnwell Rhett similarly railed against the pending Morrill Tariff before the South Carolina convention. Rhett included a lengthy attack on tariffs in the Address of South Carolina to Slaveholding States, which the convention adopted on December 25, 1860 to accompany its secession ordinance. > And so with the Southern States, towards the Northern States, in the vital > matter of taxation. They are in a minority in Congress. Their representation > in Congress, is useless to protect them against unjust taxation; and they > are taxed by the people of the North for their benefit, exactly as the > people of Great Britain taxed our ancestors in the British parliament for > their benefit. For the last forty years, the taxes laid by the Congress of > the United States have been laid with a view of subserving the interests of > the North. The people of the South have been taxed by duties on imports, not > for revenue, but for an object inconsistent with revenue-- to promote, by > prohibitions, Northern interests in the productions of their mines and > manufactures.Address of South Carolina to Slaveholding States by Convention > of South Carolina The Morrill Tariff played less prominently elsewhere in the South. In some portions of Virginia, secessionists promised a new protective tariff to assist the state's fledgling industries.Carlander and Majewski, 2003 In the North, enforcement of the tariff contributed to support for the Union cause by industrialists and merchant interests. The abolitionist Orestes Brownson derisively remarked that \\"the Morrill Tariff moved them more than the fall of Sumter.\\"\\"Emancipation and Colonization,\\" Brownson's Quarterly Review, April 1862 In one such example, the New York Times, which had had opposed Morrill's bill on free trade grounds, editorialized that the tariff imbalance would bring commercial ruin to the North and urged its suspension until the secession crisis passed: \\"We have imposed high duties on our commerce at the very moment the seceding states are inviting commerce to their ports by low duties.\\"\\"The Tariff and Secession\\", The New York Times, March 26, 1861 As secession became more evident and the fledgling Confederacy adopted a much lower tariff, the paper urged military action to enforce the Morrill Tariff in the South.\\"The Great Question\\", The New York Times, March 30, 1861 Historiography Historians, James Huston notes, have been baffled by the role of high tariffs in general and have offered multiple conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were the willing tools of would-be monopolists. A second school says the Republicans truly believed that tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with balanced growth in every region, as opposed to growth only in the cotton South. A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs to protect their high wages from European competition.James L. Huston, \\"A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines,\\" Journal of American History, June 1983, Vol. 70 Issue 1, pp 35-57 Charles A. Beard argued in the 1920s that very long-term economic issues were critical, with the pro-tariff industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the anti-tariff agrarian Midwest against the plantation South. According to Luthin in the 1940s, \\"Historians are not unanimous as to the relative importance which Southern fear and hatred of a high tariff had in causing the secession of the slave states.\\"Luthin, p. 626 However, none of the statesmen seeking a compromise in 1860-61 to avert the war ever suggested the tariff might be either the key to a solution or a cause of the secession.Robert G. Gunderson, Old Gentlemen's Convention: The Washington Peace Conference of 1861 (1981) In the 1950s, historians began to move away from the Beard thesis of economic causality. In its place, historians, led by Richard Hofstadter, began to emphasize the social causes of the war as centered on the issue of slavery. The Beard thesis has enjoyed a recent revival among economists, pro-Confederate historians, and neo-Beardian scholars. A 2002 study by economists Robert McGuire and T. Norman Van Cott concluded: > A de facto constitutional mandate that tariffs lie on the lower end of the > Laffer relationship means that the Confederacy went beyond simply observing > that a given tax revenue is obtainable with a \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" tax rate, a > la Alexander Hamilton and others. Indeed, the constitutional action suggests > that the tariff issue may in fact have been even more important in the > North‚ÄìSouth tensions that led to the Civil War than many economists and > historians currently believe. Rather than contributing to secession, Marc-William Palen notes how the tariff was passed through Congress only by the secession of Southern states. Thus, secession itself allowed for the bill's passage, rather than the other way around.Marc-William Palen, \\"The Great Civil War Lie,\\" New York Times, June 5, 2013 Allan Nevins and James M. McPherson downplay the significance of the tariff; argue that it was peripheral to the issue of slavery; and note that slavery dominated the secessionist declarations, speeches, and pamphlets. Nevins also points to the argument of Alexander Stephens, who disputed Toombs's claims about the severity of the Morrill Tariff. Though initially opposed to secession, Stephens would later cite slavery as the \\"cornerstone\\" for his support of secession. Notes References Bibliography * Charles and Mary Beard.

In all, more than of public land, or nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States, was given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders; most of the homesteads were west of the Mississippi River. An extension of the homestead principle in law, the Homestead Acts were an expression of the Free Soil policy of Northerners who wanted individual farmers to own and operate their own farms, as opposed to Southern slave-owners who wanted to buy up large tracts of land and use slave labor, thereby shutting out free white farmers. The first of the acts, the Homestead Act of 1862, opened up millions of acres. Any adult who had never taken up arms against the Federal government of the United States could apply. Women and immigrants who had applied for citizenship were eligible. The 1866 Act explicitly included black Americans and encouraged them to participate, but rampant discrimination, systemic barriers and bureaucratic inertia slowed black gains. Historian Michael Lanza argues that while the 1866 law pack was not as beneficial as it might have been, it was part of the reason that by 1900 one quarter of all Southern black farmers owned their own farms. Several additional laws were enacted in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 sought to address land ownership inequalities in the south during Reconstruction. The Timber Culture Act of 1873 granted land to a claimant who was required to plant trees‚Äîthe tract could be added to an existing homestead claim and had no residency requirement. The Kinkaid Amendment of 1904 granted a full section‚Äî‚Äîto new homesteaders settling in western Nebraska. An amendment to the Homestead Act of 1862, the Enlarged Homestead Act, was passed in 1909 and doubled the allotted acreage from in marginal areas. Another amended act, the national Stock-Raising Homestead Act, was passed in 1916 and granted for ranching purposes. Background Land-grant laws similar to the Homestead Acts had been proposed by northern Republicans before the Civil War, but had been repeatedly blocked in Congress by southern Democrats who wanted western lands open for purchase by slave-owners. The Homestead Act of 1860 did pass in Congress, but it was vetoed by President James Buchanan, a Democrat. After the Southern states seceded from the Union in 1861 (and their representatives had left Congress), the bill passed and was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln (May 20, 1862). Daniel Freeman became the first person to file a claim under the new act. Between 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed of federal land for private ownership. This was a total of 10% of all land in the United States.The Homestead Act of 1862; Archives.gov Homesteading was discontinued in 1976, except in Alaska, where it continued until 1986. About 40% of the applicants who started the process were able to complete it and obtain title to their homesteaded land after paying a small fee in cash.US Department of the Interior, National Park Service. \\"Homesteading by the Numbers\\", accessed February 5, 2010. History Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 The Donation Land Claim Act allowed settlers to claim land in the Oregon Territory, then including the modern states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and parts of Wyoming. Settlers were able to claim 320 or 640 acres (130 to 260 ha) of land for free between 1850 and 1854, and then at a cost of $1.25 per acre until the law expired in 1855. Homestead Act of 1862 Certificate of homestead in Nebraska given under the Homestead Act, 1862 The \\"yeoman farmer\\" ideal of Jeffersonian democracy was still a powerful influence in American politics during the 1840‚Äì1850s, with many politicians believing a homestead act would help increase the number of \\"virtuous yeomen\\". The Free Soil Party of 1848‚Äì52, and the new Republican Party after 1854, demanded that the new lands opening up in the west be made available to independent farmers, rather than wealthy planters who would develop it with the use of slaves forcing the yeomen farmers onto marginal lands.Eric Foner; Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War; 1970. Southern Democrats had continually fought (and defeated) previous homestead law proposals, as they feared free land would attract European immigrants and poor Southern whites to the west.Charles C. Bolton; Poor Whites of the Antebellum South: Tenants and Laborers in Central North Carolina and Northeast Mississippi; 1993; p. 67.Phillips; p. 2000.McPherson; p. 193. After the South seceded and their delegates left Congress in 1861, the Republicans and other supporters from the upper South passed a homestead act.McPherson; pp. 450‚Äì451. The intent of the first Homestead Act, passed in 1862, was to liberalize the homesteading requirements of the Preemption Act of 1841. It was signed by Abraham Lincoln on May 20, 1862, as following the Secession in the United States, the most vocal opposition in Congress, the Southern States, had been removed.Hannah L. Anderson, ‚ÄòThat Settles It: The Debate and Consequences of the Homestead Act of 1862‚Äô, The History Teacher 45.1 (2011), p. 101 Its leading advocates were Andrew Johnson,Trefousse; p. 42.

The law (and those following it) required a three-step procedure: file an application, improve the land, and file for the patent (deed). Any citizen who had never taken up arms against the U.S. government (including freed slaves after the fourteenth amendment) and was at least 21 years old or the head of a household, could file an application to claim a federal land grant. Women were eligible. The occupant had to reside on the land for five years, and show evidence of having made improvements. The process had to be complete within seven years. The act depleted the Native Americans in the United States of much of their land and natural resources as a result of it being allocated and sold to settlers.https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-native-americans-battled- a-brutal-land-grab-by-an-expanding- america/2016/11/04/69dd7c00-8402-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html Southern Homestead Act of 1866 Enacted to allow poor tenant farmers and sharecroppers in the south become land owners in the southern United States during Reconstruction. It was not very successful, as even the low prices and fees were often too much for the applicants to afford.Paul Wallace Gates, \\"Federal Land Policy in the South 1866-1888.\\" Journal of Southern History (1940) 6#3 pp: 303-330. in JSTOR Timber Culture Act of 1873 The Timber Culture Act granted up to 160 acres of land to a homesteader who would plant at least 40 acres (revised to 10) of trees over a period of several years. This quarter-section could be added to an existing homestead claim, offering a total of 320 acres to a settler. This offered a cheap plot of land to homesteaders. Kinkaid Amendment of 1904 Recognizing that the Sandhills (Nebraska) of north-central Nebraska, required more than 160 acres for a claimant to support a family, Congress passed the Kinkaid Act which granted larger homestead tracts, up to 640 acres, to homesteaders in Nebraska. Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909 Because by the early 1900s much of the prime low-lying alluvial land along rivers had been homesteaded, the Enlarged Homestead Act was passed in 1909. To enable dryland farming, it increased the number of acres for a homestead to given to farmers who accepted more marginal lands (especially in the Great Plains), which could not be easily irrigated.Realty and Resource Protection /bmps.Par.41235.File.dat/Split%20Estate%20Presentation%202006.pdf Split EstatePrivate Surface / Public Minerals: What Does it Mean to You?, a 2006 Bureau of Land Management presentation A massive influx of these new farmers, combined with inappropriate cultivation techniques and misunderstanding of the ecology, led to immense land erosion and eventually the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 In 1916, the Stock-Raising Homestead Act was passed for settlers seeking of public land for ranching purposes. Subsistence Homesteads provisions under the New Deal ‚Äì 1930 Typical STA \\"Jackrabbit\\" homestead cabin remains in Wonder Valley, California Renewed interest in homesteading was brought about by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's program of Subsistence Homesteading implemented in the 1930s under the New Deal. ;Small Tracts Act: In 1938 Congress passed a law, called the Small Tract Act (STA) of 1938, by which it is possible for any citizen to obtain certain lands from the Federal Government for residence, recreation, or business purposes. These tracts may not usually be larger than 5 acres. A 5-acre tract would be one which is 660 feet long and 330 feet wide, or its equivalent. The property was to be improved with a building. Starting July 1955, improvement was required to be minimum of 400 sq. feet of space. 4,000 previously classified Small Tracts were offered at public auction at fair market value, circa 1958, by the Los Angeles Office of BLM. Homesteading requirements The Homestead Acts had few qualifying requirements. A homesteader had to be the head of the household or at least twenty-one years old. They had to live on the designated land, build a home, make improvements, and farm it for a minimum of five years. The filing fee was eighteen dollars (or ten to temporarily hold a claim to the land). Immigrants, farmers without their own land, single women, and former slaves could all qualify. The fundamental racial qualification was that one had to be a citizen, or have filed a declaration of intention to become a citizen, and so the qualification changed over the years with the varying legal qualifications for citizenship. African-Americans became qualified with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. South Asians and East Asians who had been born in the United States became qualified with the decision of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898, but little high-quality land remained available by that time. For immigrants the fundamental qualification was that they had to be permitted to enter the country (which was usually co-extensive with being allowed to file a declaration of intention to become a citizen). During the 1800s, the bulk of immigrants were from Europe, with immigrants from South Asia and East Asia being largely excluded, and (voluntary) immigrants from Africa were permitted but uncommon. In practice Settlers found land and filed their claims at the regional land office, usually in individual family units, although others formed closer knit communities. Often, the homestead consisted of several buildings or structures besides the main house. The Homestead Act of 1862 gave rise later to a new phenomenon, large land rushes, such as the Oklahoma Land Runs of the 1880s and 90s. End of homesteading Dugout home from a homestead near Pie Town, New Mexico, 1940 The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 ended homesteading; (paragraphs.3,6&13) (Includes data on the U.S. Homestead Act) by that time, federal government policy had shifted to retaining control of western public lands. The only exception to this new policy was in Alaska, for which the law allowed homesteading until 1986. The last claim under this Act was made by Ken Deardorff for of land on the Stony River in southwestern Alaska. He fulfilled all requirements of the homestead act in 1979 but did not receive his deed until May 1988. He is the last person to receive title to land claimed under the Homestead Acts. Criticism The homestead acts were much abused. Although the intent was to grant land for agriculture, in the arid areas east of the Rocky Mountains, was generally too little land for a viable farm (at least prior to major federal public investments in irrigation projects). In these areas, people manipulated the provisions of the act to gain control of resources, especially water. A common scheme was for an individual, acting as a front for a large cattle operation, to file for a homestead surrounding a water source, under the pretense that the land was to be used as a farm. Once the land was granted, other cattle ranchers would be denied the use of that water source, effectively closing off the adjacent public land to competition. That method was also used by large businesses and speculators to gain ownership of timber and oil-producing land. The federal government charged royalties for extraction of these resources from public lands. On the other hand, homesteading schemes were generally pointless for land containing \\"locatable minerals,\\" such as gold and silver, which could be controlled through mining claims under the Mining Act of 1872, for which the federal government did not charge royalties. The government developed no systematic method to evaluate claims under the homestead acts. Land offices relied on affidavits from witnesses that the claimant had lived on the land for the required period of time and made the required improvements. In practice, some of these witnesses were bribed or otherwise colluded with the claimant. Although not necessarily fraud, it was common practice for the eligible children of a large family to claim nearby land as soon as possible. After a few generations, a family could build up a sizable estate.Hansen, Zeynep K., and Gary D. Libecap. \\"Small Farms, Externalities, and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s\\", Journal of Political Economy, Volume: 112(3). ‚Äì pp.665‚Äì94. ‚Äì 21 November 2003 The homesteads were criticized as too small for the environmental conditions on the Great Plains; a homesteader using 19th-century animal-powered tilling and harvesting could not have cultivated the 1500 acres later recommended for dry land farming. Some scholars believe the acreage limits were reasonable when the act was written, but reveal that no one understood the physical conditions of the plains. According to Hugh Nibley, much of the rain forest west of Portland, Oregon was acquired by the Oregon Lumber Company by illegal claims under the Act.See Nibley, Hugh. Approaching Zion (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 9), p. 469. Nibley's grandfather, Charles W. Nibley made his fortune in Oregon lumber, among other resources. Nonetheless, in 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that 70 percent of economists and 84 percent of economic historians disagreed that \\"Nineteenth-century U.S. land policy, which attempted to give away free land, probably represented a net drain on the productive capacity of the country.\\" Robert Higgs argues that the Homestead Act induced no long-term misallocation of resources.See Higgs, Robert. The Transformation of the American Economy,1865-1914, p. 92. Related acts in other countries Canada Similar laws were passed in Canada: The Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed The Free Grants and Homestead Act in 1868, which introduced a conditional scheme to an existing free grant plan previously authorized by the Province of Canada in The Public Lands Act of 1860. It was extended to include settlement in the Rainy River District under The Rainy River Free Grants and Homestead Act, 1886, These Acts were consolidated in 1913 in The Public Lands Act, which was further extended in 1948 to provide for free grants to former members of the Canadian Forces. The original free grant provisions for settlers were repealed in 1951, and the remaining provisions were repealed in 1961. The Parliament of Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act in 1872 in order to encourage settlement in the Northwest Territories. Its application was restricted after the passage of the Natural Resources Acts in 1930, and it was finally repealed in 1950. The Legislative Assembly of Quebec did not expand the scope of the 1860 Province of Canada Act (which modern day Quebec was part of in 1860), but did provide in 1868 that such lands were exempt from seizure, and chattels thereon were also exempt for the first ten years of occupation. Later known as the Settlers Protection Act, it was repealed in 1984. Newfoundland and Labrador provided for free grants of land upon proof of possession for twenty years prior to 1977, with continuous use for agricultural, business or residential purposes during that time., discussed at Similar programs continued to operate in Alberta and British Columbia until 1970. In the early 21st century, some land is still being granted in the Yukon Territory under its Agricultural Lands Program. New Zealand Despite the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi provisions for sale of land, the MƒÅori Land Court decided that all land not cultivated by MƒÅori was 'waste land' and belonged to the Crown without purchase. Most New Zealand provinces had Waste Lands Acts enacted between 1854 and 1877. The 1877 Land Act in Auckland Province used the term Homestead, with allocation administered by a Crown Lands Board. There was similar legislation in Westland. It gave up to , with settlers just paying the cost of a survey. They had to live there for five years, build a house and cultivate a third of the land, if already open, or a fifth if bush had to be cleared. The land was forfeited if they didn't clear enough bush. This contributed to rapid deforestation. Elsewhere in the British Empire Similar in intent, the British Crown Lands Acts were extended to several of the Empire's territories, and many are still in effect, to some extent, today. For instance, the Australian selection acts were passed in the various Australian colonies following the first, in 1861, in New South Wales.

He is the author of the books The Abolition of Work and Other Essays, Beneath the Underground, Friendly Fire, Anarchy After Leftism, and Defacing the Currency, and numerous political essays. Biography Black graduated from the University of Michigan and Georgetown Law School. He later took M.A. degrees in jurisprudence and social policy from the University of California, Berkeley and criminal justice from the University at Albany, SUNY, and an LL.M in criminal law from the University at Buffalo Law School. During his undergraduate studies (1969‚Äì1973), he became disillusioned with the New Left of the 1970s and undertook extensive readings in anarchism, utopian socialism, council communism, and other left tendencies critical of both Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and social democracy. He found some of these sources at the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan, a major collection of radical, labor, socialist, and anarchist materials which is now the repository for Black's papers and correspondence. He was soon drawn to Situationist thought, egoist communism, and the anti-authoritarian analyses of John Zerzan and the Detroit magazine Fifth Estate. He produced a series of ironic political posters signed \\"The Last International\\", first in Ann Arbor, Michigan, then in San Francisco where he moved in 1978. In the Bay Area he became involved with the publishing and cultural underground, writing reviews and critiques of what he called the \\"marginals milieu.\\" Since 1988 he has lived in upstate New York.Uri Gordon, \\"Bob Black\\", in The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest, Wiley-Blackwell 2009. Black is best known for penning a 1985 essay, \\"The Abolition of Work,\\" which has been widely reprinted and translated into at least thirteen languages (most recently, Urdu). In it he argued that work is a fundamental source of domination, comparable to capitalism and the state, which should be transformed into voluntary \\"productive play.\\" Black acknowledged among his inspirations the French utopian socialist Charles Fourier, the British utopian socialist William Morris, the Russian anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin, and the Situationists. The Abolition of Work and Other Essays, published by Loompanics in 1986, included, along with the title essay, some of his short Last International texts, and some essays and reviews reprinted from his column in San Francisco's Appeal to Reason, a leftist and counter-cultural tabloid published from 1980 to 1984. Two more essay collections were later published as books, Friendly Fire (Autonomedia, 1992) and Beneath the Underground (Feral House, 1994), the latter devoted to the do-it-yourself/fanzine subculture of the '80s and '90s which he called \\"the marginals milieu\\" and in which he had been heavily involved. Anarchy after Leftism (C.A.L. Press, 1996) is a more or less point-by-point rebuttal of Murray Bookchin's Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm (A.K. Press, 1996), which had criticized as \\"lifestyle anarchism\\" various nontraditional tendencies in contemporary anarchism. Black's short book (\\"about an even shorter book,\\" as he put it) was succeeded‚Äîas an E-book published in 2011 at the online Anarchist Library‚Äîby Nightmares of Reason, a longer and more wide-ranging critique of Bookchin's anthropological and historical arguments, especially Bookchin's espousal of \\"libertarian municipalism\\" which Black ridiculed as \\"mini-statism.\\" Black's most recent book, \\"Instead of Work\\" (2015), collects his writings about work from 1985 to 2015. Since 2000, Black has focused on topics reflecting his education and reading in the sociology and the ethnography of law, resulting in writings often published in Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed. His recent interests have included the anarchist implications of dispute resolution institutions in stateless primitive societies (arguing that mediation, arbitration, etc., cannot feasibly be annexed to the U.S. criminal justice system, because they presuppose anarchism and a relative social equality not found in state/class societies). At the 2011 annual B.A.S.T.A.R.D. anarchist conference in Berkeley, California, Black presented a workshop where he argued that, in society as it is, crime can be an anarchist method of social control, especially for people systematically neglected by the legal system. An article based on this presentation appeared in Anarchy magazine and in his 2013 book, Defacing the Currency: Selected Writings, 1992‚Äì2012. Black is a longtime critic of democracy, which he regards as antithetical to anarchism. He has criticized democracy since the 1970s. Murray Bookchin, when he identified as an anarchist, was the most prominent advocate of anarchism as democracy. In the 1990s, Murray Bookchin became the most famous advocate of anarchism as democracy. For Bookchin, democracy ‚Äî the \\"direct democracy\\" of face-to-face assemblies of citizens‚Äî is anarchism. A few contemporary anarchists agree, including the academics Cindy Milstein, David Graeber, and Peter Staudenmeier. Black, however, has always rejected the idea that democracy (direct or representative) is anarchist. He made this argument at a presentation at the Long Haul Bookshop (in Berkeley) in 2008. In 2011, C.A.L. Press published as a pamphlet Debunking Democracy, elaborating on the speech and providing citation support. This too is reprinted in Defacing the Currency. Writing Some of his work from the early 1980s includes (anthologized in The Abolition of Work and Other Essays) highlights his critiques of the nuclear freeze movement (\\"Anti-Nuclear Terror\\"), the editors of Processed World (\\"Circle A Deceit: A Review of Processed World\\"), radical feminists (\\"Feminism as Fascism\\"), and right-wing libertarians (\\"The Libertarian As Conservative\\"). Some of these essays previously appeared in \\"San Francisco's Appeal to Reason\\" (1981‚Äì1984), a leftist and counter-cultural tabloid newspaper for which Black wrote a column. The Abolition of Work The Abolition of Work and Other Essays (1986) draws upon some ideas of the Situationist International, the utopian socialists Charles Fourier and William Morris, anarchists such as Paul Goodman, and anthropologists such as Richard Borshay Lee and Marshall Sahlins. Black criticizes work for its compulsion, and, in industrial society, for taking the form of \\"jobs\\"‚Äîthe restriction of the worker to a single limited task, usually one which involves no creativity and often no skill. Black's alternative is the elimination of what William Morris called \\"useless toil\\" and the transformation of useful work into \\"productive play,\\" with opportunities to participate in a variety of useful yet intrinsically enjoyable activities, as proposed by Charles Fourier. Beneath the Underground (1992) is a collection of texts relating to what Black calls the \\"marginals milieu\\"‚Äîthe do-it-yourself zine subculture which flourished in the 80s and early 90s. Friendly Fire (1992) is, like Black's first book, an eclectic collection touching on many topics including the Art Strike, Nietzsche, the first Gulf War and the Dial-a-Rumor telephone project he conducted with Zack Replica (1981‚Äì1983). Defacing the Currency: Selected Writings, 1992‚Äì2012 was published by Little Black Cart Press in 2013. It includes a lengthy (113 pages), previously unpublished critique of Noam Chomsky, \\"Chomsky on the Nod.\\" A similar collection has been published, in Russian translation, by Hylaea Books in Moscow. Black's most recent book, also from LBC Books, is Instead of Work, which collects \\"The Abolition of Work\\" and seven other previously published texts, with a lengthy new update, \\"Afterthoughts on the Abolition of Work.\\" The introduction is by science fiction writer Bruce Sterling.

The Morrill Act of 1862 ( et seq.) was enacted during the American Civil War, and the Morrill Act of 1890 (the Agricultural College Act of 1890 (, et seq.) expanded this model. Passage of original bill Justin Smith Morrill For 20 years prior to the first introduction of the bill in 1857, there was a political movement calling for the creation of agriculture colleges. The movement was led by Professor Jonathan Baldwin Turner of Illinois College. For example, the Michigan Constitution of 1850 called for the creation of an \\"agricultural school\\",\\"Michigan Constitution of 1850\\". Wikisource. Article 13, Section 11. Retrieved March 5, 2008. though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan Governor Kinsley S. Bingham signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, known today as Michigan State University, which served as a model for the Morrill Act.\\"Milestones of MSU's Sesquicentennial \\". MSU University Archives and Historical Collection. Retrieved March 5, 2008. On February 8, 1853, the Illinois Legislature adopted a resolution, drafted by Turner, calling for the Illinois congressional delegation to work to enact a land-grant bill to fund a system of industrial colleges, one in each state. Senator Lyman Trumbull of Illinois believed it was advisable that the bill should be introduced by an eastern congressman,Letter from Lyman Trumbull to J.B. Turner, 1857-10-19. and two months later Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont introduced his bill. Unlike the Turner Plan, which provided an equal grant to each state, the Morrill bill allocated land based on the number of senators and representatives each state had in Congress. This was more advantageous to the more populous eastern states.Carl L. Becker, Cornell University Founders and The Founding (Cornell University Press 1943), pp. 28‚Äì30. The Morrill Act was first proposed in 1857, and was passed by Congress in 1859, but it was vetoed by President James Buchanan. In 1861, Morrill resubmitted the act with the amendment that the proposed institutions would teach military tacticsThe Morrill Act used the phrase \\"military tactic\\". as well as engineering and agriculture. Aided by the secession of many states that did not support the plans, this reconfigured Morrill Act was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862. Land-grant colleges Most Land-Grant Universities Morrill Hall, on the campus of the University of Maryland, College Park (a land-grant university), is named for Senator Justin Morrill, in honor of the act he sponsored. Beaumont Tower at Michigan State University marks the site of College Hall which is the first building in the United States to teach agricultural science. The purpose of the land-grant colleges was: > without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including > military tactic, to teach such branches of learning as are related to > agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legislatures of the > States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and > practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and > professions in life. From the early to mid-19th century the federal government, through 162 violence-backed cessions, expropriated approximately 10.7 million acres of land from 245 tribal nations and divided it into roughly 80,000 parcels for redistribution. Under the act, each eligible state received of federal land, either within or contiguous to its boundaries, for each member of congress the state had as of the census of 1860. This land, or the proceeds from its sale, was to be used toward establishing and funding the educational institutions described above. Under provision six of the Act, \\"No State while in a condition of rebellion or insurrection against the government of the United States shall be entitled to the benefit of this act,\\" in reference to the recent secession of several Southern states and the contemporaneously raging American Civil War. After the war, however, the 1862 Act was extended to the former Confederate states; it was eventually extended to every state and territory, including those created after 1862. If the federal land within a state was insufficient to meet that state's land grant, the state was issued scrip which authorized the state to select federal lands in other states to fund its institution. For example, New York carefully selected valuable timber land in Wisconsin to fund Cornell University. The resulting management of this scrip by the university yielded one third of the total grant revenues generated by all the states, even though New York received only one-tenth of the 1862 land grant. Overall, the 1862 Morrill Act allocated of land, which when sold yielded a collective endowment of $7.55 million. On September 12, 1862, the state of Iowa was the first to accept the terms of the Morrill Act which provided the funding boost needed for the fledgling State Agricultural College and Model Farm (eventually renamed Iowa State University of Science and Technology). The first land-grant institution actually created under the Act was Kansas State University, which was established on February 16, 1863, and opened on September 2, 1863. The land grant colleges transformed engineering education in America and boosted the United States into a position of leader in technical education. Before the Civil War, American colleges trained students in classical studies and the liberal arts. Education was for the affluent and entrance requirements often required proficiency in the dead languages of Latin and Greek, excluding all the working classes. American engineers were mostly educated at the United States Military Academy, on fortress construction, and their instructors were the authors of most engineering texts of the day. The Morrill Act changed all of that. Though the Congressional debates about the Act were largely focused on benefits to agriculture, the mechanic arts were specifically included in the Act's language, meaning applied sciences and engineering. The Act prohibited spending the endowment on constructing buildings as expensive and unnecessary, so instead the tools for engineering education increased, such as textbooks, laboratories and equipment. The number of engineers skyrocketed. Whereas in 1866 there were around 300 American men who had graduated with engineering degrees and only six reputable colleges granting them, just four years later there were 21 colleges offering engineering degrees and the total number of engineers graduated had tripled to 866. The following decade added another 2,249 engineers, and by 1911 the United States was graduating 3,000 engineers a year, with a total of 38,000 in the work force. At the time, Germany was graduating 1,800 engineers per year. The US had become the leader in technical education just 50 years after passage of the Morrill Act. With a few exceptions (including Cornell University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), nearly all of the land-grant colleges are public. (Cornell University, while private, administers several state-supported contract colleges that fulfill its public land-grant mission to the state of New York.) To maintain their status as land-grant colleges, a number of programs are required to be maintained by the college. These include programs in agriculture and engineering, as well as a Reserve Officers' Training Corps program. Expansion A second Morrill Act in 1890 was also aimed at the former Confederate states. This act required each state to show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. Among the seventy colleges and universities which eventually evolved from the Morrill Acts are several of today's historically Black colleges and universities. Though the 1890 Act granted cash instead of land, it granted colleges under that act the same legal standing as the 1862 Act colleges; hence the term \\"land-grant college\\" properly applies to both groups. Later on, other colleges such as the University of the District of Columbia and the \\"1994 land-grant colleges\\" for Native Americans were also awarded cash by Congress in lieu of land to achieve \\"land-grant\\" status. In imitation of the land-grant colleges' focus on agricultural and mechanical research, Congress later established programs of sea grant colleges (aquatic research, in 1966), urban grant colleges (urban research, in 1985), space grant colleges (space research, in 1988), and sun grant colleges (sustainable energy research, in 2003). Agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension service Starting in 1887, Congress also funded agricultural experiment stations and various categories of agricultural and veterinary research \\"under direction of\\" the land-grant universities. Congress later recognized the need to disseminate the knowledge gained at the land-grant colleges to farmers and homemakers. The Smith‚ÄìLever Act of 1914 started federal funding of cooperative extension, with the land-grant universities' agents being sent to virtually every county of every state. In some states, the annual federal appropriations to the land-grant college under these laws exceed the current income from the original land grants. In the fiscal year 2006 USDA budget, $1.033 billion went to research and cooperative extension activities nationwide.USDA Budget Summary 2006 - Research, Education, and Economics For this purpose, then President George W. Bush proposed a $1.035 billion appropriation for fiscal year 2008.

They encouraged development of a national currency backed by bank holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as part of the United States Department of the Treasury and a system of nationally chartered banks. The Act shaped today's national banking system and its support of a uniform U.S. banking policy. Background At the end of the Second Bank of the United States in 1836, the control of banking regimes devolved mostly to the states. Different states adopted policies including a total ban on banking (as in Wisconsin), a single state-chartered bank (as in Indiana and Illinois), limited chartering of banks (as in Ohio), and free entry (as in New York). While the relative success of New York's \\"free banking\\" laws led a number of states to also adopt a free-entry banking regime, the system remained poorly integrated across state lines. Though all banknotes were uniformly denominated in dollars, notes would often circulate at a steep discount in states beyond their issue. In the end, there were well-publicized frauds arising in states like Michigan, which had adopted free entry regimes but did not require redeemability of bank issues for specie. The perception of dangerous \\"wildcat banking‚Äù, along with the poor integration of the U.S. banking system, led to increasing public support for a uniform national banking regime. A \\"greenback\\" note issued by the U.S. during the Civil War The United States Government, on the other hand, still had limited taxation capabilities, and so had an interest in the seigniorage potential of a national bank. In 1846, the Polk Administration created a United States Treasury system that moved public funds from private banks to Treasury branches in order to fund the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. However, without a national currency, the revenue generated this way was limited. One of the first attempts to issue a national currency came in the early days of the Civil War when Congress approved the Legal Tender Act of 1862, allowing the issue of $150 million in national notes known as greenbacks and mandating that paper money be issued and accepted in lieu of gold and silver coins. The bills were backed only by the national government's promise to redeem them and their value was dependent on public confidence in the government as well as the ability of the government to give out specie in exchange for the bills in the future. Many thought this promise backing the bills was about as good as the green ink printed on one side, hence the name \\"greenbacks.\\"Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. Economic History. Detroit: Gale, 2000. The Second Legal Tender Act,ch. 142, enacted July 11, 1862, a Joint Resolution of Congress,United States Congress. Resolution of January 17, 1863, No. 9. Washington D.C.: 1863 and the Third Legal Tender Act,ch. 73, enacted March 3, 1863, expanded the limit to $450 million. The largest amount of greenbacks outstanding at any one time was calculated as $447,300,203.10. The National Bank Act (ch. 58, ; February 25, 1863), originally known as the National Currency Act, was passed in the Senate by a 23‚Äì21 vote, and was supplemented a year later by the National Banking Act of 1864. The goals of these acts was to create a single national currency, a nationalized bank chartering system, and to raise money for the Union war effort. The Act established national banks that could issue notes which were backed by the United States Treasury and printed by the government itself. The quantity of notes that a bank was allowed to issue was proportional to the bank's level of capital deposited with the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury. To further control the currency, the Act taxed notes issued by state and local banks, essentially pushing non-federally issued paper out of circulation. First National Bank, Philadelphia Since the establishment of the Republic, state governments had held authority to regulate banks. Before the act, state legislatures typically issued bank charters on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration whether the area needed a new bank, and if the applicant was of good moral standing. As this system could be subject to corruption, states began passing \\"free banking\\" laws in 1837, which meant that any applicant who filled out the correct paperwork and deposited an in-kind payment to the state would be granted a charter. By the 1860s, over half of states had such a law on the books. However, the National Banking Act of 1864 (ch. 106, ; June 3, 1864) brought a close to the issue by establishing federally-issued bank charters, which took banking out of the hands of state governments. The first bank to receive a national charter was the First National Bank of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Charter #1). The first new national bank to open was The First National Bank of Davenport, Iowa (Charter #15). Additionally, the new Act converted more than 1,500 state banks to national banks. National Bank Acts  National Bank Act of 1863 The National Bank Act of 1863 was passed on February 25th, 1863, and was the first attempt to establish a central bank after the failures of the First and Second Banks of the United States, and served as the predecessor to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. The act allowed the creation of national banks, set out a plan for establishing a national currency backed by government securities held by other banks, and gave the federal government the ability to sell war bonds and securities (in order to help the war effort). National banks were chartered by the federal government, and were subject to stricter regulation; they had higher capital requirements and were not allowed to loan more than 10% of their holdings. A high tax on state banks was levied to discourage competition, and by 1865 most state banks had either received national charters or collapsed. National Bank Act of 1864 The 1864 act, based on a New York State law, brought the federal government into active supervision of commercial banks. It established the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency with the responsibility of chartering, examining and supervising all national banks. National Bank Act of 1865‚Äì66 On July 13, 1866, the banking Act of 1865 was extended beyond requiring every national banking association, state bank, or state banking association to pay a 10% tax on any notes paid out by them. The act of 1866 added that any persons, as well as of state banks and state banking associations used for circulation to also be taxed 10%. This act was considered enforced by the court case Veazie Bank v. Fenno, supra. The official enactment by Congress read, \\"That every national banking association, state bank, or state banking association shall pay a tax of ten percent on the amount of notes of any person, state bank, or state banking association used for circulation and paid out by them after the 1st day of August, 1866, and such tax shall be assessed and paid in such manner as shall be prescribed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\\" Most state banks flipped charters to avoid the tax. It was not until the 1870s and 80s when the growing popularity of checks developed by state banks and the declining importance and profitability of bank notes issued by national banks caused a resurgence in chartering of state banks. Veazie Bank v. Fenno was a case between a state chartered Maine bank and the collector of internal revenue. The bank declined to pay the new 10% tax on notes when Fenno tried to collect, saying the tax imposed was unconstitutional. The question posed to the court was, \\"Whether the second clause of the 9th section of the Act of Congress of the 13th of July, 1866, under which the tax in his case was levied and collected, is a valid and constitutional law.\\" The Chief Justices ruling over the case sided with Congress, in effect ending any resistance by state banks to the acts of 1865 or 1866. On April 12th 1866 congress passed the Contraction Act of 1866. Resurgence of state banks The granting of charters led to the creation of many national banks and a national banking system which grew at a fast pace. The number of national banks rose from 66 immediately after the Act to 7,473 in 1913. Initially, this rise in national banking came at the expense of state banking‚Äîthe number of state banks dwindled from 1,466 in 1863 to 247 in 1868. Though state banks were no longer allowed to issue notes, local bankers took advantage of less strict capital requirements ($10,000 for state banks vs. $50,000‚Äì200,000 for national banks) and opened new branches en masse. These new state banks then served as competition for national banks, growing to 15,526 in number by 1913. The years leading up to the passing of the 10% tax on banknotes consisted of events surrounding the National Banking Act of 1864. During this time period, Hugh McCulloch was determined to \\"fight against the national banking legislation, which he rightly perceived as a threat to state-chartered banking. Although he tried to block the system's creation, he [McCulloch] was not determined to be its champion.\\" Part of his plans to revamp this portion of the banking system included hiring a new staff, being hands-on with several aspects such as \\"personally evaluating applications for bank charters and consoled prospective bankers\\", and \\"assisting in the design of the new national bank notes, and arranged for their engraving, printing, and distribution.\\" As an end result of McCulloch's efforts, many banks were just not willing to conform to his system of operations. This prompted Congress to pass \\"a 10 percent tax on the notes of state banks, signaling its determination that national banks would triumph and the state banks would fade away.\\" A later act, passed on March 3, 1865, imposed a tax of 10 percent on the notes of state banks to take effect on July 1, 1866. Similar to previous taxes, this effectively forced all non-federal currency from circulation. It also resulted in the creation of demand deposit accounts, and encouraged banks to join the national system, increasing the number of national banks substantially. Legacy The National Banking Acts served to create the (federal-state) dual structure that is now a defining characteristic of the U.S. banking system and economy. The Comptroller of the Currency continues to have significance in the U.S. economy and is responsible for administration and supervision of national banks as well as certain activities of bank subsidiaries (per the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999). In 2004 the Act was used by John D. Hawke, Jr., Comptroller of the Currency, to effectively bar state attorneys general from national bank oversight and regulatory roles. Many blame the resulting lack of oversight and regulation for the late-2000s recession, the bailout of the U.S. financial system and the subprime mortgage crisis. See also *US banking law *Cuomo v.

The city of Haifa forms part of the Haifa metropolitan area, the second- or third-most populous metropolitan area in Israel. It is home to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith's Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a destination for Bah√° º√≠ pilgrimage. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel, the settlement has a history spanning more than 3,000 years. The earliest known settlement in the vicinity was Tell Abu Hawam, a small port city established in the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE).Encyclopedia Judaica, Haifa, Keter Publishing, Jerusalem, 1972, vol. 7, pp. 1134‚Äì1139 In the 3rd century CE, Haifa was known as a dye-making center. Over the millennia, the Haifa area has changed hands: being conquered and ruled by the Canaanites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Persians, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, Ottomans, and the British. Since the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948, the Haifa Municipality has governed the city. , the city is a major seaport located on Israel's Mediterranean coastline in the Bay of Haifa covering . It lies about north of Tel Aviv and is the major regional center of northern Israel. Two respected academic institutions, the University of Haifa and the Technion, are located in Haifa, in addition to the largest K‚Äì12 school in Israel, the Hebrew Reali School. The city plays an important role in Israel's economy. It is home to Matam, one of the oldest and largest high-tech parks in the country; Haifa also owns the only underground rapid transit system located in Israel, known as the Carmelit. Haifa Bay is a center of heavy industry, petroleum refining and chemical processing. Haifa formerly functioned as the western terminus of an oil pipeline from Iraq via Jordan. Etymology Western Haifa from the air The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from the name of the high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root ◊ó◊§◊î (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word ◊ó◊ï÷π◊£ (hof), meaning \\"shore\\", or ◊ó◊ï÷π◊£ ◊ô÷∏◊§÷∂◊î (hof yafe), meaning \\"beautiful shore\\". Other spellings in English included Caipha, Kaipha, Caiffa, Kaiffa and Khaifa. Locations and names Sycaminum and Efa The earliest named settlement within the area of modern-day Haifa was a city known as Sycaminum. The remains of the ancient town can be found in a coastal tell, or archaeological mound, known in Hebrew as Tel Shikmona, meaning \\"mound of the Ficus sycomorus\\", and in Arabic as Tell el-Semak or Tell es-Samak, meaning \\"mound of the sumak trees\\", names that preserved and transformed the ancient name, by which the town is mentioned once in the Mishnah (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it. The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, some time after the end of the 1st century, when a Roman fortress and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period. Porphyreon Around the 6th century, Porphyreon or Porphyrea is mentioned in the writings of William of Tyre, and while it lies within the area covered by modern Haifa, it was a settlement situated south of Haifa-Sycaminon. Early Muslim Haifa Following the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Haifa was used to refer to a site established on Tel Shikmona upon what were already the ruins of Sycaminon (Shiqmona). Haifa (or Haifah) is mentioned by the mid-11th-century Persian chronicler Nasir Khusraw, and the 12th- and 13th-century Arab chroniclers, Muhammad al-Idrisi and Yaqut al- Hamawi. Crusader Caiphas The Crusaders, who captured Haifa briefly in the 12th century, call it Caiphas, and believe its name related to Cephas, the Aramaic name of Simon Peter. Eusebius is also said to have referred to Hefa as Caiaphas civitas, and Benjamin of Tudela, the 12th-century Jewish traveller and chronicler, is said to have attributed the city's founding to Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest at the time of Jesus. Late Ottoman \\"Old Haifa\\" Haifa al-'Atiqa (Arabic: \\"Ancient Haifa\\") is another name used by some locals to refer to Tell es-Samak, when it was the site of Haifa while a hamlet of 250 residents, before it was moved in 1764‚Äì5 to the site from which the modern city emerged. Haifa al-Jadida (New Haifa) and modern Haifa In 1764-5 Zahir al-Umar moved the village to a new site to the east, which he also fortified. The new village, the nucleus of modern Haifa, was first called al- imara al-jadida (Arabic: \\"the new construction\\") by some, but others residing there called it Haifa al-Jadida (Arabic: \\"New Haifa\\") at first, and then simply Haifa. In the early 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was repopulated with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood in which many Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded outward from its new location.Seikaly, 2002, p. 65. History Jars excavated at Tell Abu Hawam Bronze Age: Tell Abu Hawam A town known today as Tell Abu Hawam was established during the Late Bronze Age (14th century BCE). It was a port and fishing village. In the Hebrew Bible Mount Carmel and the Kishon River are mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. A grotto on the top of Mount Carmel is known as the \\"Cave of Elijah\\", traditionally linked to the Prophet Elijah and his apprentice, Elisha. In Arabic, the highest peak of the Carmel range is called the Muhraka, or \\"place of burning,\\" harking back to the burnt offerings and sacrifices there in Canaanite and early Israelite times Persian and Hellenistic period: near Shikmona In the 6th century BCE, during the Persian period, Greek geographer Scylax wrote of a city \\"between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus\\" (i.e., the Carmel), which may be a reference to Shikmona, a locality in the Haifa area. By Hellenistic times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now the Bat Galim neighborhood of modern Haifa because the old port's harbour had become blocked with sand. A Greek- speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.Haifa, The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1970, p.382 =Shikmona= Haifa was located near the town of Shikmona, a center for making the traditional Tekhelet dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple. The archaeological site of Shikmona is southwest of Bat Galim. Early Haifa is believed to have occupied the area which extends from the present-day Rambam Hospital to the Jewish Cemetery on Yafo Street. The inhabitants engaged in fishing and agriculture. Roman period In about the 3rd century CE, Haifa was first mentioned in Talmudic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi Avdimi and other Jewish scholars. According to the Talmud, fishermen caught Murex, sea snails which yielded purple dye used to make tallit (Jewish prayer shawls) from Haifa to the Ladder of the Tyrians. Tombs dating from the Roman era, including Jewish burial caves, have been found in the area.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-haifa Byzantine period Under Byzantine rule, Haifa continued to grow but did not assume major importance. A kinah speaks of the destruction of the Jewish community of Haifa along with other communities when the Byzantines reconquered the country from the Sasanian Empire in 628 during the Byzantine- Sasanian War. Early Muslim period Following the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 630s-40s, Haifa was largely overlooked in favor of the port city of 'Akka. Under the Rashidun Caliphate, Haifa began to develop. In the 9th century under the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates, Haifa established trading relations with Egyptian ports and the city featured several shipyards. The inhabitants, Arabs and Jews, engaged in trade and maritime commerce. Glass production and dye-making from marine snails were the city's most lucrative industries. Crusader, Ayyubid and Mamluk rule Mount Carmel before 1899 Prosperity ended in 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and blockaded by European Christians shortly after the end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison. Jews comprised the majority of the city's population at the time. Under the Crusaders, Haifa was reduced to a small fortified coastal stronghold. It was a part of the Principality of Galilee within the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin's Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed.Lane-Poole, 1906, p.219. The Crusaders under Richard the Lionheart retook Haifa in 1191.Lane-Poole, 1906, p.309. In the 12th century religious hermits started inhabiting the caves on Mount Carmel, and in the 13th century they formed a new Catholic monastic order, the Carmelites. Under Muslim rule, the church which they had built on Mount Carmel was turned into a mosque, later becoming a hospital. In the 19th century, it was restored as a Carmelite monastery, the Stella Maris Monastery. The altar of the church as we see it today, stands over a cave associated with Prophet Elijah. In 1265, the army of Mamluk sultan Baibars captured Haifa, destroying its fortifications, which had been rebuilt by King Louis IX of France, as well as the majority of the city's homes to prevent the European Crusaders from returning. From the time of its conquest by the Mamluks to the 15th century, Haifa was an unfortified small village or uninhabited. At various times there were a few Jews living there and both Jews and Christians made pilgrimages to the Cave of Elijah on Mount Carmel. During Mamluk rule in the 14th century, al-Idrisi wrote that Haifa served as the port for Tiberias and featured a \\"fine harbor for the anchorage of galleys and other vessels. Ottoman period Haifa in 1898 Haifa was apparently uninhabited at the time the Ottoman Empire conquered Palestine in 1516. The first indication of its resettlement was given in a description by German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf, who visited Palestine in 1575. In 1596, Haifa appeared in Ottoman tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Sahil Atlit of the Liwa of Lajjun. It had a population of 32 Muslim households and paid taxes on wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, and goats or beehives. Haifa was subsequently mentioned in the accounts of travelers as a half-ruined impoverished village with few inhabitants. The expansion of commercial trade between Europe and Palestine in the 17th century saw Haifa's revival as a flourishing port as more ships began docking there rather than Acre. In 1742, Haifa was a small village and had a Jewish community composed mainly of immigrants from Morocco and Algeria which had a synagogue. It had 250 inhabitants in 1764‚Äì5. It was located at Tell el-Semak, the site of ancient Sycaminum. In 1765, Zahir al-Umar, the Arab ruler of Acre and the Galilee, moved the population to a new fortified site to the east and laid waste to the old site.Haifa in the Late Ottoman Period, 1864‚Äì1914: A Muslim Town in Transition By Mahmud Yazbak BRILL, 1998, p 14 According to historian Moshe Sharon, the new Haifa was established by Zahir in 1769. This event marked the beginning of modern Haifa. After al-Umar's death in 1775, the town remained under Ottoman rule until 1918, with the exception of two brief periods. In 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Haifa during his unsuccessful campaign to conquer Palestine and Syria, but he soon had to withdraw; in the campaign's final proclamation, Napoleon took credit for having razed the fortifications of \\"Ka√Øffa\\" (as the name was spelled at the time) along with those of Gaza, Jaffa and Acre. German Colony in the 19th century Between 1831 and 1840, the Egyptian viceroy Muhammad Ali governed Haifa, after his son Ibrahim Pasha had wrested control over it from the Ottomans. When the Egyptian occupation ended and Acre declined, the importance of Haifa rose. In 1858, the walled city of Haifa was overcrowded and the first houses began to be built outside the city walls on the mountain slope. The British Survey of Western Palestine estimated Haifa's population to be about 3,000 in 1859.Carmel, Alex: Ottoman Haifa: A History of Four Centuries under Turkish Rule (2010) Haifa remained majority Muslim throughout this time but a small Jewish community continued to exist there. In 1798, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov spent Rosh HaShana with the Jewish community of Haifa. In 1839 the Jewish population numbered 124.Encyclopedia Judaica, Volume 7, P. 1137 Due to the growing influence of the Carmelite monks, Haifa's Christian population also grew. By 1840 approximately 40% of the inhabitants were Christian Arabs. The arrival of German messianics, many of whom were Templers, in 1868, who settled in what is now known as the German Colony, was a turning point in Haifa's development. The Templers built and operated a steam-based power station, opened factories and inaugurated carriage services to Acre, Nazareth and Tiberias, playing a key role in modernizing the city. Palestine Exploration Fund map of Haifa, 1875 Haifa 1942 1:20,000 The first major wave of Jewish immigration to Haifa took place in the mid-19th century from Morocco, with a smaller wave of immigration from Turkey a few years later. In the 1870s, large numbers of Jewish and Arab migrants came to Haifa due to the town's growing prosperity. Jews constituted one- eighth of Haifa's population, almost all of whom were recent immigrants from Morocco and Turkey who lived in the Jewish Quarter, which was located in the eastern part of the town. Continued Jewish immigration gradually raised the Jewish population of Haifa, and included a small number of Ashkenazi families, most of whom opened hotels for Jewish migrants coming into the city. In 1875, the Jewish community of Haifa held its own census which counted the Jewish population at about 200.https://books.google.co.il/books?id=DPseCvbPsKsC&pg;=PA107 The First Aliyah of the late 19th century and the Second Aliyah of the early 20th century saw Jewish immigrants, mainly from Eastern Europe, arrive in Haifa in significant numbers. In particular, a significant number of Jewish immigrants from Romania settled in Haifa in the 1880s during the First Aliyah period. The Central Jewish Colonisation Society in Romania purchased over near Haifa. As the Jewish settlers had been city dwellers, they hired the former fellahin tenants to instruct them in agriculture.Oliphant, Laurence. (1886) Haifa, or Life in Modern Palestine. Adamant Media Corporation, pp. 11‚Äì12 The Jewish population rose from 1,500 in 1900 to 3,000 on the eve of World War I.Carmel, Alex: Ottoman Haifa: A History of Four Centuries under Turkish Rule View of Haifa from Mount Carmel in 1930 In 1909, Haifa became important to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith when the remains of the B√°b, founder of the B√°b√≠ Faith and forerunner of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Bah√° º√≠s consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Bah√° ºu'll√°h in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bah√° ºu'll√°h himself to his eldest son,  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°, in 1891.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° were buried in November 1921. In the early 20th century, Haifa began to emerge as an industrial port city and growing population center. A branch of the Hejaz railway, known as the Jezreel Valley railway, was built between 1903 and 1905. The railway increased the city's volume of trade, and attracted workers and foreign merchants. In 1912, construction began on the Technion Institute of Technology, a Jewish technical school that was to later become one of Israel's top universities, although studies did not begin until 1924. The Jews of Haifa also founded numerous factories and cultural institutions. British Mandate Indian troops marching in Haifa in 1918 Kingsway (now HaAtzmaut Road) in the 1930s Haifa 1945 Haifa was captured from the Ottomans in September 1918 by Indian horsemen of the British Army armed with spears and swords who overran Ottoman positions. On 22 September, British troops were heading to Nazareth when a reconnaissance report was received indicating that the Turks were leaving Haifa. The British made preparations to enter the city and came under fire in the Balad al-Sheikh district (today Nesher). After the British regrouped, an elite unit of Indian horsemen were sent to attack the Turkish positions on the flanks and overrun their artillery guns on Mount Carmel. Under the British Mandate, Haifa saw large-scale development and became an industrial port city. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith in 1918 and today has its administrative and spiritual centre in the environs of Haifa. Many Jewish immigrants of the Fourth Aliyah and Fifth Aliyah settled in Haifa. The port was a major source of income, and the nearby Jewish towns of the Krayot were established in the 1930s. At the same time, the Arab population also swelled by an influx of migrants, coming mainly from surrounding villages as well as the Syrian Hauran.Reinhard Schulze. A modern history of the Islamic world. p.98. The Arab immigration mainly came as a result of prices and salary drop. The 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British authorities, recorded Haifa as having a population of 9,377 Muslims, 8,863 Christians, 6,230 Jews, and 164 others. By the time of the 1931 census of Palestine, this had increased to 20,324 Muslims, 13,824 Christians, 15,923 Jews, and 332 others.Bosworth, C. Edmund: Historic Cities of the Islamic WorldBarron, 1923, p. 10 Between the censuses of 1922 and 1931, the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian populations rose by 217%, 256%, and 156%, respectively.; In 1938, 52,000 Jews and 51,000 Muslims and Christians lived in Haifa.Seikaly, Max: Haifa: Transformation of an Arab Society 1918‚Äì1939, p. 51 Haifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization.Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa. By 1945 the population was 33% Muslim, 20% Christian and 47% Jewish.Supplement to a Survey of Palestine (p. 12‚Äì13) which was prepared by the British Mandate for the United Nations in 1946‚Äì47. In 1947, about 70,910 Arabs (41,000 Muslims and 29,910 Christians) and 74,230 Jews were living there. The Christian community were mostly Greek- Melkite Catholics. 1947‚Äì1948 Civil War in Palestine Haifa Maronite Boy Scouts, 1939.

British soldiers remove injured passenger from SS Exodus Haifa in 1950s The 1947 UN Partition Plan in late November 1947 designated Haifa as part of the proposed Jewish state. Arab protests over that decision evolved into violence between Jews and Arabs that left several dozen people dead during December.Palestine Post, many issues December 1947. The Arab city was in a state of chaos. The local Arab national committee tried to stabilize the situation by organizing garrison, calming the frightened residents and to stop the flight. In a public statement, the national committee called upon the Arab residents to obey orders, be alert, keep calm, and added: \\"Keep away the cowards who wish to flee. Expell them from your lines. Despise them, because they harm more than the enemy\\". Despite the efforts, Arab residents abandoned the streets which bordered Jewish neighborhoods and during the days of the general strike instigated by the Arab Higher Committee, some 250 Arab families abandoned the Khalisa neighborhood.Yoav Gelber, Independence Versus Nakba; Kinneret‚ÄìZmora-Bitan‚ÄìDvir Publishing, 2004, , pp.136‚Äì137 On 30 December 1947, members of the Irgun, a Jewish underground militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside the gates of the Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in what became known as the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al- Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre.Benny Morris, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p101. British forces in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by Jewish forces in Operation Bi'ur Hametz, by the Carmeli Brigade of the Haganah, commanded by Moshe Carmel. The operation led to a massive displacement of Haifa's Arab population. According to The Economist at the time, only 5,000‚Äì6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948. Contemporaneous sources emphasized the Jewish leadership's attempt to stop the Arab exodus from the city and the Arab leadership as a motivating factor in the refugees' flight. According to the British district superintendent of police, \\"Every effort is being made by the Jews to persuade the Arab populace to stay and carry on with their normal lives, to get their shops and business open and to be assured that their lives and interests will be safe.\\"Karsh, Efraim. Palestine Betrayed. New Haven: Yale UP, 2010. 124. Print. Time magazine wrote on 3 May 1948: \\"The mass evacuation, prompted partly by fear, partly by orders of Arab leaders, left the Arab quarter of Haifa a ghost city. ... By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa.\\" Benny Morris said Haifa's Arabs left due to a combination of Zionist threats and encouragement to do so by Arab leaders. Ilan Papp√© writes that the shelling culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76 mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.Papp√©, Ilan (1992).

He comments: \\"Nor is there any evidence that a \\"massacre\\" took place in the town.\\" State of Israel View of Haifa Bay from Mount Carmel in 2004 After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar Hacarmel date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them.So much for the melting pot, Tom Segev Their demand for \\"bread and work\\" was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut. Tel Aviv gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of Ashdod as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing Tiberias as a tourist centre.Kellerman, Aharon (1993) Society and Settlement: Jewish Land of Israel in the Twentieth Century SUNY Press, p 236 Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the former Soviet Union boosted the population by a further 35,000. The Matam high-tech park, the first dedicated high-tech park in Israel, opened in Haifa in the 1970s. Many of Wadi Salib's historic Ottoman buildings have now been demolished, and in the 1990s a major section of the Old City was razed to make way for a new municipal center. From 1999 to 2003, several Palestinian suicide attacks took place in Haifa (in Maxim and Matza restaurants, bus 37, and others), killing 68 civilians. In 2006, Haifa was hit by 93 Hezbollah rockets during the Second Lebanon War, killing 11 civilians and leading to half of the city's population fleeing at the end of the first week of the war. Among the places hit by rockets were a train depot and the oil refinery complex. Demographics Downtown Haifa and port with the Sail Tower in the foreground Haifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households, or a population of . Immigrants from the former Soviet Union constitute 25% of Haifa's population. According to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, Israeli Arabs constitute 10% of Haifa's population, the majority living in Wadi Nisnas, Abbas and Halissa neighborhoods. Haifa is commonly portrayed as a model of co-existence between Arabs and Jews, although tensions and hostility do still exist.Faier, Elizabeth (2005) Organizations, Gender, and the Culture of Palestinian Activism in Haifa, Israel: fieldwork and Palestinians in Israel New venues: nongovernmental organizations and social change Activism: support, conflict, and ideas Two tales of a city: history, space, and identity Honor, land, and protest ... Routledge, Between 1994 and 2009, the city had a declining and aging population compared to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, as young people moved to the center of the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years. A development plan approved in 2016 seeks to raise Haifa's population to 330,000 residents by 2025.http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-new-haifa-outline-plan-55000-more- residents-by-2025-1001159957 Religious and ethnic communities The Hadar HaCarmel neighborhood The population is heterogeneous. Israeli Jews comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are Arab Christians) and, some 4% are Muslims (of which 20% are AhmadisThere are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir of the 4% (under 11,000) Muslims: *). Haifa also includes Druze and Bah√° º√≠ Faith communities. In 2006, 27% of the Arab population was aged 14 and under, compared to 17% of the Jewish and other population groups. The trend continues in the age 15‚Äì29 group, in which 27% of the Arab population is found, and the age 30‚Äì44 group (23%). The population of Jews and others in these age groups are 22% and 18% respectively. Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60‚Äì74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population. In 2006, 2.9% of the Jews in the city were Haredi, compared to 7.5% on a national scale. However, the Haredi community in Haifa is growing fast due to a high fertility rate. 66.6% were secular, compared to a national average of 43.7%. A significant portion of the immigrants from the former Soviet Union either lack official religious-ethnic classification or are Non-Jews as their mothers were not Jewish (Jewishness is passes down through the mother.) There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen. Haifa is the center of liberal Arabic-speaking culture, as it was under British colonial rule. The Arabic-speaking neighborhoods, which are mixed Muslim and Christian, are in the lowlands near the sea, while Jewish neighborhoods are at higher elevation. An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century. Geography Haifa is situated on the Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain, the historic land bridge between Europe, Africa, and Asia, and the mouth of the Kishon River. Located on the northern slopes of Mount Carmel and around Haifa Bay, the city is split over three tiers. The lowest is the center of commerce and industry including the Port of Haifa. The middle level is on the slopes of Mount Carmel and consists of older residential neighborhoods, while the upper level consists of modern neighborhoods looking over the lower tiers. From here views can be had across the Western Galilee region of Israel towards Rosh HaNikra and the Lebanese border. Haifa is about north of the city of Tel Aviv, and has a large number of beaches on the Mediterranean. Flora and fauna The Carmel Mountain has three main wadis: Lotem, Amik and Si'ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, golden jackal, hyrax, Egyptian mongoose, owls and chameleons. Climate Haifa has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, rainy winters (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). Spring arrives in March when temperatures begin to increase. By late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. The average temperature in summer is and in winter, . Snow is rare in Haifa, but temperatures around can sometimes occur, usually in the early morning. Humidity tends to be high all year round, and rain usually occurs between September and May. Annual precipitation is approximately . Neighborhoods Bat Galim neighborhood and Haifa Bay Panorama Towers Haifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in modern Haifa is Wadi Salib, the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for government buildings. Wadi Salib stretches across to Wadi Nisnas, the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the German Colony was built, providing the first model of urban planning in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife. The first buildings in Hadar were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib. Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods. Neve Sha'anan, a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of Bat Galim, Shikmona Beach, and Kiryat Eliezer. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s. To the south of Mount Carmel's headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of Ein HaYam, Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David. Above Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the Carmel Tzarfati (French Carmel), Merkaz HaCarmel, Romema, Ahuzat Ha'Carmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, Vardiya, Ramat Golda, Ramat Alon and Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya). While there are general divisions between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods. Another of the Carmel neighborhoods is Kababir, home to the National Headquarters of Israel's Ahmadiyya Community; located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast. Urban development Ben-Gurion Avenue and the German Colony Recently, residential construction has been concentrated around Kiryat Haim and Kiryat Shmuel, with of new residential construction between 2002 and 2004, the Carmel, with , and Ramot Neve Sha'anan with approximately Non- residential construction was highest in the Lower Town, (90,000 sq m), Haifa Bay (72,000 sq m) and Ramot Neve Sha'anan (54,000 sq m). In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private. Currently, the city has a modest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings. Though buildings rising up to 20 stories were built on Mount Carmel in the past, the Haifa municipality banned the construction of any new buildings taller than nine stories on Mount Carmel in July 2012. The neighborhood of Wadi Salib, located in the heart of downtown Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use.Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd: Wadi Salib Haifa Economic Corporation Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a Turkish bathhouse, and a Middle Eastern music and dance club, which has been converted into theaters and offices. In 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location. Another plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated. As part of the development plans, the Israeli Navy, which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between Bat Galim and Hof Hashaket. A long esplanade which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea. In addition, a 50,000 square-meter entertainment complex that will contain a Disney theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen Multiplex theater will be built at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels. In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built. In 2016, a new plan for the city was approved. The plan included a new main downtown business district, the creation of a park in a current industrial area, new construction and renovation of public buildings and hubs of higher education, tourism, culture, commerce, leisure, and residence. Economy Haifa Oil Refinery Matam hi-tech park The common Israeli saying, \\"Haifa works, Jerusalem prays, and Tel Aviv plays\\" attests to Haifa's reputation as a city of workers and industry. The industrial region of Haifa is in the eastern part of the city, around the Kishon River. It is home to the Haifa oil refinery, one of the two oil refineries in Israel (the other refinery being located in Ashdod). The Haifa refinery processes 9 million tons (66 million barrels) of crude oil a year. Its nowadays unused twin 80-meter high cooling towers, built in the 1930s, were the tallest buildings built in the British Mandate period. Matam (short for Merkaz Ta'asiyot Mada ‚Äì Scientific Industries Center), the largest and oldest business park in Israel, is at the southern entrance to the city, hosting manufacturing and R&D; facilities for a large number of Israeli and international hi-tech companies, such as Apple, Amazon, Abbot, Cadence, Intel, IBM, Magic Leap, Microsoft, Motorola, Google, Yahoo!, Elbit, CSR, Philips, PwC and Amdocs. The campus of the University of Haifa is also home to IBM Haifa Labs. The Port of Haifa is the leader in passenger traffic among Israeli ports, and is also a major cargo harbor, although deregulation has seen its dominance challenged by the Port of Ashdod. Haifa malls and shopping centers include Hutsot Hamifratz, Horev Center Mall, Panorama Center, Castra Center, Colony Center (Lev HaMoshava), Hanevi'im Tower Mall, Kanyon Haifa, Lev Hamifratz Mall and Grand Kanyon. In 2010, Monocle magazine identified Haifa as the city with the most promising business potential, with the greatest investment opportunities in the world. The magazine noted that \\"a massive head-to-toe regeneration is starting to have an impact; from scaffolding and cranes around town, to renovated fa√ßades and new smart places to eat\\". The Haifa municipality had spent more than $350 million on roads and infrastructure, and the number of building permits had risen 83% in the previous two years. In 2014, it was announced that a technology-focused stock exchange would be established to compete with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Currently, some 40 hotels, mostly boutique hotels, are planned, have been approved, or are under construction. The Haifa Municipality is seeking to turn the city into Northern Israel's tourist center, from where travelers can embark on day trips into Acre, Nazareth, Tiberias, and the Galilee. A new life sciences industrial park containing five buildings with 85,000 square meters of space on a 31-duman (7.75 acre) site is being built adjacent to the Matam industrial park. Tourism Bah√° º√≠ Gardens and the Shrine of the B√°b In 2005, Haifa had 13 hotels with a total of 1,462 rooms. The city has a shoreline, of which are beaches. Haifa's main tourist attraction is the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre, with the golden-domed Shrine of the B√°b and the surrounding gardens. Between 2005 and 2006, 86,037 visited the shrine. In 2008, the Bah√° º√≠ gardens were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The restored German Colony, founded by the Templers, Stella Maris and Elijah's Cave also draw many tourists. Located in the Haifa district are the Ein Hod artists' colony, where over 90 artists and craftsmen have studios and exhibitions, and the Mount Carmel national park, with caves where Neanderthal and early Homo Sapiens remains were found. A 2007 report commissioned by the Haifa Municipality calls for the construction of more hotels, a ferry line between Haifa, Acre and Caesarea, development of the western anchorage of the port as a recreation and entertainment area, and an expansion of the local airport and port to accommodate international travel and cruise ships. Arts and culture Promenade along Dado Beach Folk dancing on Dado Beach Despite its image as a port and industrial city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets to move to the city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theater, the first municipal theater founded in the country. The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern Arab population is the al- Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events. The New Haifa Symphony Orchestra, established in 1950, has more than 5,000 subscribers. In 2004, 49,000 people attended its concerts. The Haifa Cinematheque, founded in 1975, hosts the annual Haifa International Film Festival during the intermediate days of the Sukkot holiday. Haifa has 29 movie theaters. The city publishes a local newspaper, Yediot Haifa, and has its own radio station, Radio Haifa. The Israeli Arabic-language newspapers Al-Ittihad and Al-Madina are also based in Haifa. During the 1990s, Haifa hosted the Haifa Rock & Blues Festival featuring Bob Dylan, Nick Cave, Blur and PJ Harvey. The last festival was held in 1995 with Sheryl Crow, Suede and Faith No More as headliners. Museums National Museum of Science, Haifa Haifa has over a dozen museums. The most popular museum is the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space, which recorded almost 150,000 visitors in 2004. The museum is located in the historic Technion building in the Hadar neighborhood. The Haifa Museum of Art houses a collection of modern and classical art, as well as displays on the history of Haifa. The Tikotin Museum of Japanese Art is the only museum in the Middle East dedicated solely to Japanese art. Other museums in Haifa include the Museum of Prehistory, the National Maritime Museum and Haifa City Museum, the Hecht Museum, the Dagon Archaeological Museum of Grain Handling, the Railway Museum, the Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, the Israeli Oil Industry Museum, and Chagall Artists' House. As part of his campaign to bring culture to Haifa, Mayor Abba Hushi provided the artist Mane-Katz with a building on Mount Carmel to house his collection of Judaica, which is now a museum. The former home and studio of artist Hermann Struck is now the Hermann Struck Museum. The Haifa Educational Zoo at Gan HaEm park houses a small animal collection including Syrian brown bears, now extinct from Israel. W◊üthin the zoo is the Pinhas House biology institute. In the close vicinity of Haifa, on the Carmel, the Northern \\"Hai-Bar\\" (\\"wild life\\") operated by Israel's Parks and Reserves Authority for the purpose of breeding and reintroduction of species now extinct from Israel, such as Persian Fallow Deer. Government As an industrial port city, Haifa has traditionally been a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. Haifa court buildingIn recent years, there has been a drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%. Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with the remainder of the council made up of four Jews and six Arabs. Today, Haifa is governed by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem. The results of municipal elections decide on the makeup of the council, similarly to the Knesset elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui- Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet with representatives from the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.

Whole wings of the hospital were moved to large underground shelters. Education Haifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges. The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of Bras√≠lia and United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Oscar Niemeyer. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University. The Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology, described as Israel's MIT, was founded in 1912. It has 18 faculties and 42 research institutes. The original building now houses Haifa's science museum. The Hebrew Reali School was founded in 1913. It is the largest k-12 school in Israel, with 4,000 students in 7 branches, all over the city. The first technological high school in Israel, Bosmat, was established in Haifa in 1933. Other academic institutions in Haifa are the Gordon College of Education and Sha'anan Religious Teachers' College, the WIZO Haifa Academy of Design and Education, and Tiltan College of Design. The Michlala Leminhal College of Management and the Open University of Israel have branches in Haifa. The city also has a nursing college and the P.E.T Practical Engineering School. ‚Äì07, Haifa had 70 elementary schools, 23 middle schools, 28 academic high schools and 8 vocational high schools. There were 5,133 pupils in municipal kindergartens, 20,081 in elementary schools, 7,911 in middle schools, 8,072 in academic high schools, 2,646 in vocational high schools, and 2,068 in comprehensive district high schools. 86% of the students attended Hebrew- speaking schools and 14% attended Arab schools. 5% were in special education. In 2004, Haifa had 16 municipal libraries stocking 367,323 books. Two prestigious Arab schools in Haifa are the Orthodox School, run by the Greek Orthodox church, and the Nazareth Nuns' School, a Catholic institution. Transportation Public transportation Cable Car descending from Mount Carmel to Bat Galim Haifa is served by six railway stations and the Carmelit, currently Israel's only subway system (another is planned in Tel Aviv). The Nahariya‚ÄìTel Aviv Coastal Railway main line of Israel Railways runs along the coast of the Gulf of Haifa and has six stations within the city. From south-west to north-east, these stations are: Haifa Hof HaCarmel, Haifa Bat Galim, Haifa Merkaz HaShmona, HaMifrats Central, Hutzot HaMifratz and Kiryat Haim. Together with the Kiryat Motzkin Railway Station in the northern suburb Kiryat Motzkin, they form the Haifa ‚Äì Krayot suburban line (\\"Parvarit\\"). There are direct trains from Haifa to Tel Aviv, Ben Gurion International Airport, Nahariya, Akko, Kiryat Motzkin, Binyamina, Lod, Ramla, Beit Shemesh, Jerusalem and other locations, but all trains to Beersheba skips all Haifa stations. Haifa's intercity bus connections are operated almost exclusively by the Egged bus company, which operates two terminals: * HaMifratz Central Bus Station, adjacent to the HaMifrats Central Railway Station * Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station, adjacent to the Hof HaCarmel Railway Station Lines to the North of the country use HaMifratz Central Bus Station and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station. The Carmelit, an underground funicular railway which is currently Israel's only subway systemDestinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Eilat, Raanana, Netanya, Hadera, Zikhron Ya'akov, Atlit, Tirat Carmel, Ben Gurion International Airport and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the Ramat Vizhnitz neighborhood and run to Jerusalem, Bnei Brak and Ashdod. These used to be \\"mehadrin\\" (i.e. gender segregated) lines. All urban lines are run by Egged. There are also share taxis that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses ‚Äì named \\"Shkhunatit\\" and run by Egged. In December 2012, GetTaxi, an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station (by identifying and summoning the closest taxi) began operating. In the current initial phase, 50 taxis from the service are operating in Haifa. Completed Metronit track in downtown Haifa Haifa and the Krayot suburbs also have a new Phileas concept bus rapid transit system called the Metronit. These buses, operating with hybrid engines, follow optical strips embedded in designated lanes of roads, providing tram-like public transportation services. The Metronit consists of 100 18-meter buses, each with the capacity for 150 passengers, operating along of designated roadways. The new system officially opened on 16 August 2013 serving three lines. Haifa is one of the few cities in Israel where buses operate on Shabbat. Bus lines operate throughout the city on a reduced schedule from late Saturday morning onwards, and also connect Haifa with Nesher, Tirat Karmel, Yokneam, Nazareth, Nazareth Illit and intermediate communities. Since the summer of 2008, night buses are operated by Egged in Haifa (line 200) and the Krayot suburbs (line 210). During the summer of 2008 these lines operated 7 nights a week. Since 2013, along with route 1 of the Metronit, they operate 7 nights a week, making Haifa as the only city in Israel with 24/7 public transportation. Haifa is also the only city in Israel to operate a Saturday bus service to the beaches during summer time. Egged lines run during Saturday mornings from many neighborhoods to the Dado and Bat Galim beaches, and back in the afternoon. The Port of Haifa The Haifa underground railway system is called Carmelit. It is a subterranean funicular on rails, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother's Park) on Mount Carmel. With a single track, six stations and two trains, it is listed in Guinness World Records as the world's shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles. Haifa also has a cable car. The Haifa Cable Car gondola lift consists of six cabins and connects Bat Galim on the coast to the Stella Maris observation deck and monastery atop Mount Carmel. It serves mainly tourists. There are currently plans to add a 4.4 kilometre commuter cable car service to Haifa's public transport system, running from HaMifratz Central Bus Station at the foot of Mount Carmel to the Technion, and then to the University of Haifa. Air and sea transport Haifa Airport serves domestic flights to Tel Aviv and Eilat as well as international charters to Cyprus, Greece and Jordan. The airliners that operate flights from Haifa are Arkia and Israir. There are currently plans to expand services from Haifa. Cruise ships operate from Haifa port primarily to destinations in the Eastern Mediterranean, Southern Europe and Black Sea. Roads Travel between Haifa and the center of the country is possible by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the downtown area of the city. The Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the downtown area. Sports Sammy Ofer Stadium The main stadiums in Haifa are: Sammy Ofer Stadium, a UEFA-approved 30,780-seat stadium, completed in 2014, replacing the 14,002-seat Kiryat Eliezer Stadium that was demolished 2016, Thomas D'Alesandro Stadium and Neve Sha'anan Athletic Stadium that seats 1,000.

The discriminant of a polynomial is generally defined in terms of a polynomial function of its coefficients. The discriminant is widely used in factoring polynomials, number theory, and algebraic geometry. The discriminant of the quadratic polynomial ax^2+bx+c\\\\, (a e 0), often denoted by the symbol \\\\Delta, is: :b^2-4ac, which is zero if and only if the polynomial has a double root. In the case of real coefficients, it is positive if and only if the polynomial has two distinct real roots. Similarly for a cubic polynomial, the discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. In the case of real coefficients, the discriminant is positive if the roots are three distinct real numbers, and negative if there is one real root and two distinct complex conjugate roots. More generally, the discriminant of a polynomial of positive degree is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root. If the coefficients are real, and there are no multiple roots, the discriminant is positive if the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4 (zero included), and negative otherwise. Several generalizations of the discriminant of a (univariate) polynomial are also called discriminant: the discriminant of an algebraic number field; the discriminant of a quadratic form; more generally, the discriminant of a form, a homogeneous polynomial, or a projective hypersurface (these three concepts are essentially equivalent). Origin The term \\"discriminant\\" was coined in 1851 by the British mathematician James Joseph Sylvester. Sylvester coins the word \\"discriminant\\" on page 406. Definition Let :A(x) = a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_1x+a_0 be a polynomial of degree (this means a_n e 0), such that the coefficients a_0, \\\\ldots, a_n belong to a field, or, more generally, to a commutative ring. The resultant of and its derivative A'(x) = na_nx^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2}+\\\\cdots+a_1 is a polynomial in a_0, \\\\ldots, a_n with integer coefficients, which is the determinant of the Sylvester matrix of and . The nonzero entries of the first column of the Sylvester matrix are a_n and na_n, and the resultant is thus a multiple of a_n. Hence the discriminant‚Äîup to its sign‚Äîis defined as the quotient of the resultant of and by a_n: :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A) = \\\\frac{(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}}{a_n} \\\\operatorname{Res}_x(A,A') Historically, this sign has been chosen such that, over the reals, the discriminant will be positive when all the roots of the polynomial are real. The division by a_n may not be well defined if the ring of the coefficients contains zero divisors. Such a problem may be avoided by replacing a_n by 1 in the first column of the Sylvester matrix‚Äîbefore computing the determinant. In any case, the discriminant is a polynomial in a_0, \\\\ldots, a_n with integer coefficients. Expression in terms of the roots When the polynomial is defined over a field, the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that it has roots, , not necessarily all distinct, in an algebraically closed extension of the field. (For a polynomial with real coefficients, this algebraically closed extension is generally chosen as the field of complex numbers.) In terms of the roots, the discriminant is equal to :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A) = {a_n}^{2n-2}\\\\prod_{i It is thus the square of the Vandermonde polynomial times . This expression of the discriminant is often taken as a definition. It makes clear that if the polynomial has a multiple root, then its discriminant is zero, and that if all the roots are real and simple, then the discriminant is positive. Low degrees The discriminant of a linear polynomial (degree 1) is rarely considered. If needed, it is commonly defined to be equal to 1 (using the usual conventions for the empty product and considering that one of the two blocks of Sylvester matrix is empty). There is no common convention for the discriminant of a constant polynomial (i.e., polynomial of degree 0). For small degrees, the discriminant is rather simple (see below), but for higher degrees, it may become unwieldy. For example, the discriminant of a general quartic has 16 terms, that of a quintic has 59 terms, and that of a sextic has 246 terms. This is OEIS sequence . Degree 2 The quadratic polynomial ax^2+bx+c \\\\, has discriminant :b^2-4ac\\\\,. The square root of the discriminant appears in the quadratic formula for the roots of the quadratic polynomial: :x_{1,2}=\\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}. where the discriminant is zero if and only if the two roots are equal. If are real numbers, the polynomial has two distinct real roots if the discriminant is positive, and two complex conjugate roots if it is negative. The discriminant is the product of and the square of the difference of the roots. If are rational numbers, then the discriminant is the square of a rational number, if and only if the two roots are rational numbers. Degree 3 The zero set of discriminant of the cubic , i.e. points satisfying . The cubic polynomial ax^3+bx^2+cx+d \\\\, has discriminant :b^2c^2-4ac^3-4b^3d-27a^2d^2+18abcd\\\\,. In particular, the polynomial x^3+px+q has discriminant : -4p^3-27q^2\\\\,. The discriminant is zero if and only if at least two roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers, and the discriminant is not zero, the discriminant is positive if the roots are three distinct real numbers, and negative if there is one real root and two complex conjugate roots. The square root of the product of the discriminant by (and possibly also by the square of a rational number) appears in the formulas for the roots of a cubic polynomial. If the polynomial is irreducible and its coefficients are rational numbers (or belong to a number field), then the discriminant is a square of a rational number (or a number from the number field) if and only if the Galois group of the cubic equation is the cyclic group of order three. Degree 4 The discriminant of the quartic polynomial . The surface represents points () where the polynomial has a repeated root. The cuspidal edge corresponds to the polynomials with a triple root, and the self-intersection corresponds to the polynomials with two different repeated roots. The quartic polynomial ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e\\\\, has discriminant :\\\\begin{align} {} & 256a^3e^3-192a^2bde^2-128a^2c^2e^2+144a^2cd^2e \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & {} -27a^2d^4+144ab^2ce^2-6ab^2d^2e-80abc^2de \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & {} +18abcd^3+16ac^4e-4ac^3d^2-27b^4e^2+18b^3cde \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & {} -4b^3d^3-4b^2c^3e+b^2c^2d^2\\\\,. \\\\end{align} The discriminant is zero if and only if two or more roots are equal. If the coefficients are real numbers and the discriminant is negative, then there are two real roots and two complex conjugate roots. Likewise, if the discriminant is positive, then the roots are either all real or all non-real. Properties Zero discriminant The discriminant of a polynomial over a field is zero if and only if the polynomial has a multiple root in some field extension. The discriminant of a polynomial over an integral domain is zero, if and only if the polynomial and its derivative have a non-constant common divisor. In characteristic 0, this is equivalent to saying that the polynomial is not square-free (i.e., divisible by the square of a non-constant polynomial). In nonzero characteristic , the discriminant is zero if and only if the polynomial is not square-free or it has an irreducible factor which is not separable (i.e., the irreducible factor is a polynomial in x^p). Invariance under change of the variable The discriminant of a polynomial is, up to a scaling, invariant under any projective transformation of the variable. As a projective transformation may be decomposed into a product of translations, homotheties and inversions, this results in the following formulas for simpler transformations, where denotes a polynomial in the variable of degree , with a_n as leading coefficient. * Invariance by translation: ::\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P(x+\\\\alpha)) = \\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P(x)) :This results from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots * Invariance by homothety: ::\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P(\\\\alpha x)) = \\\\alpha^{n(n-1)}\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P(x)) This results from the expression in terms of the roots, or of the quasi-homogeneity of the discriminant. * Invariance by inversion: ::\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P^r(x)) =\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(P(x)) :Here, P^r denotes the reciprocal polynomial of . That is, if P(x)=a_nx^n + \\\\cdots +a_0, then ::P^r(x) = x^nP(1/x) = a_0x^n +\\\\cdots +a_n. Invariance under ring homomorphisms Let \\\\varphi\\\\colon R\\\\to S be a homomorphism of commutative ring. Given a polynomial :A=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \\\\cdots+a_0 in , the homomorphism \\\\varphi acts on for producing the polynomial :A^\\\\varphi=\\\\varphi(a_n)x^n+\\\\varphi(a_{n-1})x^{n-1}+ \\\\cdots+\\\\varphi(a_0) in . The discriminant is invariant under \\\\varphi in the following sense. If \\\\varphi(a_n) e 0, then :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A^\\\\varphi) = \\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A)). As the discriminant is defined in terms of a determinant, this property results immediately from the similar property of determinants. If \\\\varphi(a_n)= 0, then \\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A)) may be zero or not. One has, when \\\\varphi(a_n)= 0, :\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A)) = \\\\varphi(a_{n-1})^2\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A^\\\\varphi). When one is only interested in knowing whether a discriminant is zero (as is generally the case in algebraic geometry), these properties may be summarised as: :\\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A)) = 0 if and only either \\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A^\\\\varphi)=0 or \\\\deg(A)-\\\\deg(A^\\\\varphi)\\\\ge 2. This is often interpreted as saying that \\\\varphi(\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A)) = 0, if and only if A^\\\\varphi has a multiple root (possibly at infinity). Product of polynomials If is a product of polynomials in , then :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{disc}_x(R) &= \\\\operatorname{disc}_x(P)\\\\operatorname{Res}_x(P,Q)^2\\\\operatorname{disc}_x(Q) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] {}&=(-1)^{pq}\\\\operatorname{disc}_x(P)\\\\operatorname{Res}_x(P,Q)\\\\operatorname{Res}_x(Q,P)\\\\operatorname{disc}_x(Q), \\\\end{align} where \\\\operatorname{Res}_x denotes the resultant with respect to the variable , and and are the respective degrees of and . This property follows immediately by substituting the expression for the resultant, and the discriminant, in terms of the roots of the respective polynomials. Homogeneity The discriminant is a homogeneous polynomial in the coefficients; it is also a homogeneous polynomial in the roots and thus quasi- homogeneous in the coefficients. The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is homogeneous of degree in the coefficients. This can be seen two ways. In terms of the roots-and-leading-term formula, multiplying all the coefficients by does not change the roots, but multiplies the leading term by . In terms of its expression as a determinant of a matrix (the Sylvester matrix) divided by , the determinant is homogeneous of degree in the entries, and dividing by makes the degree . The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is homogeneous of degree in the roots. This follows from the expression of the discriminant in terms of the roots, which is the product of a constant and \\\\binom{n}{2} = \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} squared differences of roots. The discriminant of a polynomial of degree is quasi-homogeneous of degree in the coefficient, if, for every , the coefficient of x^i is given the weight . It is also quasi- homogeneous of the same degree, if, for every , the coefficient of x^i is given the weight i. This is a consequence of the general fact that every polynomial which is homogeneous and symmetric in the roots may be expressed as a quasi-homogeneous polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions of the roots. Consider the polynomial : P=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \\\\cdots +a_0. It follows from what precedes that the exponents in every monomial appearing in the discriminant satisfy the two equations :i_0+i_1+\\\\cdots+i_n=2n-2 and :i_1+2i_2 + \\\\cdots+n i_n=n(n-1), and also the equation :ni_0 +(n-1)i_1+ \\\\cdots+ i_{n-1}=n(n-1), which is obtained by subtracting the second equation from the first one multiplied by . This restricts the possible terms in the discriminant. For the general quadratic polynomial there are only two possibilities and two terms in the discriminant, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree two in three variables has 6 terms. For the general cubic polynomial, there are five possibilities and five terms in the discriminant, while the general homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 in 5 variables has 70 terms For higher degrees, there may be monomials which satisfy above equations and do not appear in the discriminant. The first example is for the quartic polynomial , in which case the monomial satisfies the equations without appearing in the discriminant. Real roots In this section, all polynomials have real coefficients. It has been seen in that the sign of the discriminant provides a full information on the nature of the roots for polynomials of degree 2 and 3. For higher degrees, the information provided by the discriminant is less complete, but still useful. More precisely, for a polynomial of degree , one has: * The polynomial has a multiple root if and only if its discriminant is zero. * If the discriminant is positive, the number of non-real roots is a multiple of 4. That is, there is a nonnegative integer such that there are pairs of complex conjugate roots and real roots. * If the discriminant is negative, the number of non-real roots is not a multiple of 4. That is, there is a nonnegative integer such that there are pairs of complex conjugate roots and real roots. Homogeneous bivariate polynomial Let :A(x,y) = a_0x^n+ a_1 x^{n-1}y + \\\\cdots + a_n y^n=\\\\sum_{i=0}^n a_i x^{n-i}y^i be a homogeneous polynomial of degree in two indeterminates. Supposing, for the moment, that a_0 and a_n are both nonzero, one has :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x(A(x,1))=\\\\operatorname{Disc}_y(A(1,y)). Denoting this quantity by \\\\operatorname{Disc}^h (A), one has :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_x (A) =y^{n(n-1)} \\\\operatorname{Disc}^h (A), and :\\\\operatorname{Disc}_y (A) =x^{n(n-1)} \\\\operatorname{Disc}^h (A). Because of these properties, the quantity \\\\operatorname{Disc}^h (A) is called the discriminant or the homogeneous discriminant of . If a_0 and a_n may be zero, the polynomials and may have a degree smaller than . In this case, above formulas and definition remain valid, if the discriminants are computed as if all polynomials would have the degree . This means that the discriminants must be computed with a_0 and a_n indeterminate, the substitution for them of their actual values being done after this computation. Equivalently, the formulas of must be used. Use in algebraic geometry The typical use of discriminants in algebraic geometry is for studying algebraic curve and, more generally algebraic hypersurfaces. Let be such a curve or hypersurface; is defined as the zero set of a multivariate polynomial. This polynomial may be considered as a univariate polynomial in one of the indeterminates, with polynomials in the other indeterminates as coefficients. The discriminant with respect to the selected indeterminate defines a hypersurface in the space of the other indeterminates. The points of are exactly the projection of the points of (including the points at infinity), which either are singular or have a tangent hyperplane that is parallel to the axis of the selected indeterminate. For example, let be a bivariate polynomial in and with real coefficients, such that is the implicit equation of a plane algebraic curve. Viewing as a univariate polynomial in with coefficients depending on , then the discriminant is a polynomial in whose roots are the -coordinates of the singular points, of the points with a tangent parallel to the -axis and of some of the asymptotes parallel to the -axis. In other words, the computation of the roots of the -discriminant and the -discriminant allows one to compute all of the remarkable points of the curve, except the inflection points. Generalizations There are two classes of the concept of discriminant. The first class is the discriminant of an algebraic number field, which, in some cases including quadratic fields, is the discriminant of a polynomial defining the field. Discriminants of the second class arise for problems depending on coefficients, when degenerate instances or singularities of the problem are characterized by the vanishing of a single polynomial in the coefficients. This is the case for the discriminant of a polynomial, which is zero when two roots collapse. Most of the cases, where such a generalized discriminant is defined, are instances of the following. Let be a homogeneous polynomial in indeterminates over a field of characteristic 0, or of a prime characteristic that does not divides the degree of the polynomial. The polynomial defines a projective hypersurface, which has singular points if and only the partial derivatives of have a nontrivial common zero. This is the case if and only if the multivariate resultant of these partial derivatives is zero, and this resultant may be considered as the discriminant of . However, because of the integer coefficients resulting of the derivation, this multivariate resultant may be divisible by a power of , and it is better to take, as a discriminant, the primitive part of the resultant, computed with generic coefficients. The restriction on the characteristic is needed, as, otherwise, a common zero of the partial derivative is not necessarily a zero of the polynomial (see Euler's identity for homogeneous polynomials). In the case of a homogeneous bivariate polynomial of degree , this general discriminant is d^{d-2} times the discriminant defined in . Several other classical types of discriminants, that are instances of the general definition are described in next sections. Quadratic forms A quadratic form is a function over a vector space, which is defined over some basis by a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2: :Q(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ii} x_i^2+\\\\sum_{1\\\\le i or, in matrix form, :Q(X) =X A X^\\\\mathrm T, for the n\\\\times n symmetric matrix A=(a_{ij}), the 1\\\\times n row vector X=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), and the n\\\\times 1 column vector X^{\\\\mathrm{T}}. In characteristic different from 2,In characteristic 2, the discriminant of a quadratic form is not defined, and is replaced by the Arf invariant. the discriminant or determinant of is the determinant of . The Hessian determinant of is 2^n times its discriminant. The multivariate resultant of the partial derivatives of is equal to its Hessian determinant. So, the discriminant of a quadratic form is a special case of the above general definition of a discriminant. The discriminant of a quadratic form is invariant under linear changes of variables (that is a change of basis of the vector space on which the quadratic form is defined) in the following sense: a linear change of variables is defined by a nonsingular matrix , changes the matrix into S^\\\\mathrm T A\\\\,S, and thus multiplies the discriminant by the square of the determinant of . Thus the discriminant is well defined only up to the multiplication by a square. In other words, the discriminant of a quadratic form over a field is an element of , the quotient of the multiplicative monoid of by the subgroup of the nonzero squares (that is, two elements of are in the same equivalence class if one is the product of the other by a nonzero square). It follows that over the complex numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to 0 or 1. Over the real numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to ‚àí1, 0, or 1. Over the rational numbers, a discriminant is equivalent to a unique square-free integer. By a theorem of Jacobi, a quadratic form over a field of characteristic different from 2 can be expressed, after a linear change of variables, in diagonal form as :a_1x_1^2 + \\\\cdots + a_nx_n^2. More precisely, a quadratic forms on may be expressed as a sum :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i L_i^2 where the are independent linear forms and is the number of the variables (some of the may be zero). Equivalently, for any symmetric matrix , there is an elementary matrix such that S^\\\\mathrm T A\\\\,S is a diagonal matrix. Then the discriminant is the product of the , which is well-defined as a class in . Geometrically, the discriminant of a quadratic form in three variables is the equation of a quadratic projective curve. The discriminant is zero if and only if the curve is decomposed in lines (possibly over an algebraically closed extension of the field). A quadratic form in four variable is the equation of a projective surface. The surface has a singular point if and only its discriminant is zero. In this case, either the surface may be decomposed in planes, or it has a unique singular point, and is a cone or a cylinder. Over the reals, if the discriminant is positive, then the surface either has no real point or has everywhere a negative Gaussian curvature. If the discriminant is negative, the surface has real points, and has a negative Gaussian curvature. Conic sections A conic section is a plane curve defined by an implicit equation of the form :ax^2+ 2bxy + cy^2 + 2dx + 2ey + f = 0, where are real numbers. Two quadratic forms, and thus two discriminants may be associated to a conic section. The first quadratic form is :ax^2+ 2bxy + cy^2 + 2dxz + 2eyz + fz^2 = 0. Its discriminant is the determinant :\\\\begin{vmatrix} a & b & d\\\\\\\\\\\\b & c & e\\\\\\\\\\\\d & e & f \\\\end{vmatrix}. It is zero if the conic section degenerates into two lines, a double line or a single point. The second discriminant, which is the only one that is considered in many elementary textbooks, is the discriminant of the homogeneous part of degree two of the equation. It is equal to :b^2 - ac, and determines the shape of the conic section. If this discriminant is negative, the curve either has no real points, or is an ellipse or a circle, or, if degenerated, is reduced to a single point. If the discriminant is zero, the curve is a parabola, or, if degenerated, a double line or two parallel lines. If the discriminant is positive, the curve is a hyperbola, or, if degenerated, a pair of intersecting lines. Real quadric surfaces A real quadric surface in the Euclidean space of dimension three is a surface that may be defined as the zeros of a polynomial of degree two in three variables. As for the conic sections there are two discriminants that may be naturally defined. Both are useful for getting information on the nature of a quadric surface. Let P(x,y,z) be a polynomial of degree two in three variables that defines a real quadric surface. The first associated quadratic form, Q_4, depends on four variables, and is obtained by homogenizing ; that is :Q_4(x,y,z,t)=t^2P(x/t,y/t, z/t). Let us denote its discriminant by\\\\Delta_4. The second quadratic form, Q_3, depends on three variables, and consists of the terms of degree two of ; that is :Q_3(x,y,z)=Q_4(x, y,z,0). Let us denote its discriminant by\\\\Delta_3. If \\\\Delta_4>0, and the surface has real points, it is either a hyperbolic paraboloid or a one-sheet hyperboloid. In both cases, this is a ruled surface that has a negative Gaussian curvature at every point. If \\\\Delta_4<0, the surface is either an ellipsoid or a two-sheet hyperboloid or an elliptic paraboloid. In all cases, it has a positive Gaussian curvature at every point. If \\\\Delta_4=0, the surface has a singular point, possibly at infinity. If there is only one singular point, the surface is a cylinder or a cone. If there are several singular points the surface consists of two planes, a double plane or a single line. When \\\\Delta_4 e 0, the sign of \\\\Delta_3, if not 0, does not provide any useful information, as changing into does not change the surface, but changes the sign of \\\\Delta_3. However, if \\\\Delta_4 e 0 and \\\\Delta_3 = 0, the surface is a paraboloid, which is elliptic of hyperbolic, depending on the sign of \\\\Delta_4.

In general, the interior operator does not commute with unions. However, in a complete metric space the following result does hold: \\\\operatorname{int} S_i \\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{cl} \\\\operatorname{int} \\\\left( \\\\cup_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} S_i \\\\right). * If each is open in then \\\\operatorname{int} \\\\left( \\\\cap_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} \\\\operatorname{cl} S_i \\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{int} \\\\operatorname{cl} \\\\left( \\\\cap_{i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} S_i \\\\right). }}  Exterior of a set  The exterior of a subset of a topological space , denoted or , is the interior of its relative complement. Alternatively, it can be defined as , the complement of the closure of . Many properties follow in a straightforward way from those of the interior operator, such as the following. * is an open set that is disjoint with . * is the union of all open sets that are disjoint with . * is the largest open set that is disjoint with . *If , then is a superset of .

It is named for the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandroff. More precisely, let X be a topological space. Then the Alexandroff extension of X is a certain compact space X* together with an open embedding c : X ‚Üí X* such that the complement of X in X* consists of a single point, typically denoted ‚àû. The map c is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if X is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space. For such spaces the Alexandroff extension is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification. The advantages of the Alexandroff compactification lie in its simple, often geometrically meaningful structure and the fact that it is in a precise sense minimal among all compactifications; the disadvantage lies in the fact that it only gives a Hausdorff compactification on the class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff spaces, unlike the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification which exists for any topological space, a much larger class of spaces.  Example: inverse stereographic projection  A geometrically appealing example of one-point compactification is given by the inverse stereographic projection. Recall that the stereographic projection S gives an explicit homeomorphism from the unit sphere minus the north pole (0,0,1) to the Euclidean plane. The inverse stereographic projection S^{-1}: \\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\hookrightarrow S^2 is an open, dense embedding into a compact Hausdorff space obtained by adjoining the additional point \\\\infty = (0,0,1). Under the stereographic projection latitudinal circles z = c get mapped to planar circles r = \\\\sqrt{(1+c)/(1-c)}. It follows that the deleted neighborhood basis of (0,0,1) given by the punctured spherical caps c \\\\leq z < 1 corresponds to the complements of closed planar disks r \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{(1+c)/(1-c)}. More qualitatively, a neighborhood basis at \\\\infty is furnished by the sets S^{-1}(\\\\mathbb{R}^2 \\\\setminus K) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} as K ranges through the compact subsets of \\\\mathbb{R}^2. This example already contains the key concepts of the general case.  Motivation  Let c: X \\\\hookrightarrow Y be an embedding from a topological space X to a compact Hausdorff topological space Y, with dense image and one-point remainder \\\\\\\\{ \\\\infty \\\\\\\\} = Y \\\\setminus c(X). Then c(X) is open in a compact Hausdorff space so is locally compact Hausdorff, hence its homeomorphic preimage X is also locally compact Hausdorff. Moreover, if X were compact then c(X) would be closed in Y and hence not dense. Thus a space can only admit a Hausdorff one-point compactification if it is locally compact, noncompact and Hausdorff. Moreover, in such a one-point compactification the image of a neighborhood basis for x in X gives a neighborhood basis for c(x) in c(X), and‚Äîbecause a subset of a compact Hausdorff space is compact if and only if it is closed‚Äîthe open neighborhoods of \\\\infty must be all sets obtained by adjoining \\\\infty to the image under c of a subset of X with compact complement.  The Alexandroff extension  Put X^* = X \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, and topologize X^* by taking as open sets all the open subsets U of X together with all sets V = (X \\\\setminus C) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty \\\\\\\\} where C is closed and compact in X. Here, X \\\\setminus C denotes setminus. Note that V is an open neighborhood of \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty \\\\\\\\}, and thus, any open cover of \\\\\\\\{\\\\infty \\\\\\\\} will contain all except a compact subset C of X^*, implying that X^* is compact . The inclusion map c: X \\\\rightarrow X^* is called the Alexandroff extension of X (Willard, 19A). The properties below all follow from the above discussion: * The map c is continuous and open: it embeds X as an open subset of X^*. * The space X^* is compact. * The image c(X) is dense in X^*, if X is noncompact. * The space X^* is Hausdorff if and only if X is Hausdorff and locally compact. * The space X^* is T1 if and only if X is T1.  The one-point compactification  In particular, the Alexandroff extension c: X \\\\rightarrow X^* is a Hausdorff compactification of X if and only if X is Hausdorff, noncompact and locally compact. In this case it is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification of X. Recall from the above discussion that any Hausdorff compactification with one point remainder is necessarily (isomorphic to) the Alexandroff compactification. In particular, if X is a compact Hausdorff space and p is a limit point of X (i.e. not an isolated point of X), X is the Alexandroff compactification of X\\\\setminus\\\\\\\\{p\\\\\\\\}. Let X be any noncompact Tychonoff space. Under the natural partial ordering on the set \\\\mathcal{C}(X) of equivalence classes of compactifications, any minimal element is equivalent to the Alexandroff extension (Engelking, Theorem 3.5.12). It follows that a noncompact Tychonoff space admits a minimal compactification if and only if it is locally compact.  Non-Hausdorff one-point compactifications  Let (X,\\\\tau) be an arbitrary noncompact topological space. One may want to determine all the compactifications (not necessarily Hausdorff) of X obtained by adding a single point, which could also be called one-point compactifications in this context. So one wants to determine all possible ways to give X^*=X\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} a compact topology such that X is dense in it and the subspace topology on X induced from X^* is the same as the original topology. The last compatibility condition on the topology automatically implies that X is dense in X^*, because X is not compact, so it cannot be closed in a compact space. Also, it is a fact that the inclusion map c:X\\\\to X^* is necessarily an open embedding, that is, X must be open in X^* and the topology on X^* must contain every member of \\\\tau.https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3817485/non-hausdorff- one-point-compactifications So the topology on X^* is determined by the neighbourhoods of \\\\infty. Any neighborhood of \\\\infty is necessarily the complement in X^* of a closed compact subset of X, as previously discussed. The topologies on X^* that make it a compactification of X are as follows: * The Alexandroff extension of X defined above. Here we take the complements of all closed compact subsets of X as neighborhoods of \\\\infty. This is the largest topology that makes X^* a one-point compactification of X. * The open extension topology. Here we add a single neighborhood of \\\\infty, namely the whole space X^*. This is the smallest topology that makes X^* a one-point compactification of X. * Any topology intermediate between the two topologies above. For neighborhoods of \\\\infty one has to pick a suitable subfamily of the complements of all closed compact subsets of X; for example, the complements of all finite closed compact subsets, or the complements of all countable closed compact subsets.  Further examples   Compactifications of discrete spaces * The one-point compactification of the set of positive integers is homeomorphic to the space consisting of K = {0} U {1/n  n is a positive integer} with the order topology. * A sequence \\\\\\\\{a_n\\\\\\\\} in a topological space X converges to a point a in X, if and only if the map f\\\\colon\\\\mathbb N^*\\\\to X given by f(n) = a_n for n in \\\\mathbb N and f(\\\\infty) = a is continuous. Here \\\\mathbb N has the discrete topology. * Polyadic spaces are defined as topological spaces that are the continuous image of the power of a one-point compactification of a discrete, locally compact Hausdorff space.  Compactifications of continuous spaces * The one-point compactification of n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is homeomorphic to the n-sphere Sn. As above, the map can be given explicitly as an n-dimensional inverse stereographic projection. * The one-point compactification of the product of \\\\kappa copies of the half-closed interval [0,1), that is, of [0,1)^\\\\kappa, is (homeomorphic to) [0,1]^\\\\kappa. * Since the closure of a connected subset is connected, the Alexandroff extension of a noncompact connected space is connected. However a one-point compactification may \\"connect\\" a disconnected space: for instance the one-point compactification of the disjoint union of a finite number n of copies of the interval (0,1) is a wedge of n circles. * The one-point compactification of the disjoint union of a countable number of copies of the interval (0,1) is the Hawaiian earring. This is different from the wedge of countably many circles, which is not compact. * Given X compact Hausdorff and C any closed subset of X, the one- point compactification of X\\\\setminus C is X/C, where the forward slash denotes the quotient space.Joseph J. Rotman, An Introduction to Algebraic Topology (1988) Springer-Verlag (See Chapter 11 for proof.) * If X and Y are locally compact Hausdorff, then (X\\\\times Y)^* = X^* \\\\wedge Y^* where \\\\wedge is the smash product. Recall that the definition of the smash product:A\\\\wedge B = (A \\\\times B) / (A \\\\vee B) where A \\\\vee B is the wedge sum, and again, / denotes the quotient space.  As a functor  The Alexandroff extension can be viewed as a functor from the category of topological spaces with proper continuous maps as morphisms to the category whose objects are continuous maps c\\\\colon X \\\\rightarrow Y and for which the morphisms from c_1\\\\colon X_1 \\\\rightarrow Y_1 to c_2\\\\colon X_2 \\\\rightarrow Y_2 are pairs of continuous maps f_X\\\\colon X_1 \\\\rightarrow X_2, \\\\ f_Y\\\\colon Y_1 \\\\rightarrow Y_2 such that f_Y \\\\circ c_1 = c_2 \\\\circ f_X. In particular, homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic Alexandroff extensions.

A British staff nurse in a type of uniform dress that has been common since the 1980s. A nurse uniform is attire worn by nurses for hygiene and identification. The traditional nurse uniform consists of a dress, apron and cap. It has existed in many variants, but the basic style has remained recognizable. History This nurse's uniform consists of a \\"spotless apron and a practical but attractive mob cap, made simply from a plain triangle of linen\\". 1943. The first nurse uniforms were derived from the nun's habit. Before the 19th century, nuns took care of sick and injured people so it was obvious that trained lay nurses might copy the nun's habit as they have adopted ranks like \\"Sister\\". One of Florence Nightingale's first students (Miss van Rensselaer) designed the original uniform for the students at Miss Nightingale's school of nursing. Before the 1940s minor changes occurred in the uniform. The clothing consisted of a mainly blue outfit. Hospitals were free to determine the style of the nurse uniform, including the nurse's cap which exists in many variants.Hardy, Susan and Corones, Anthony, \\"The Nurse‚Äôs Uniform as Ethopoietic Fashion\\", Fashion Theory, Vol.21, No.5. (2015), pp. 523-552. doi=10.1080/1362704X.2016.1203090 In Britain, the national uniform (or simply \\"national\\") was designed with the advent of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and the Newcastle dress. From the 1960s open necks began to appear. In the 1970s, white disposable paper caps replaced cotton ones; in the 1980s, plastic aprons displaced the traditional ones and outerwear began to disappear. From the 1990s, scrubs became popular in Britain, having first appeared in the USA; however, some nurses in Britain continue to wear dresses, although some NHS trusts have removed them in favour of scrubs as in many other countries. Standard nurse's uniform Historically, a typical nurse uniform consisted of a dress, pinafore apron and nurse's cap. In some hospitals, however, student nurses also wore a nursing pin, or the pinafore apron may have been replaced by a cobbler style apron. This type of nurse's dress continues to be worn in many countries. Traditional uniforms remain common in many countries, but in Western Europe and North America, the so-called \\"scrubs\\" or tunics have become more popular. \\"Scrub dress\\" is a simpler type of uniform, and is almost always worn in operating rooms and emergency rooms. Nurses have a variety of roles in the 21st Century and therefore have a variety of \\"uniforms\\". Nurse scientists may wear a lab coat, while nurse executives may wear a suit. The \\"uniform\\" will vary by country and role. Alternative nurse uniforms A group of medical students wearing scrubs practice surgical techniques on pigs' feet. Since the late 1980s, there has been a move towards alternative designs of nursing uniforms in some countries. Newer style nurse's uniform in the United Kingdom consists of either: # A tunic-style top and dark blue trousers that are optimally designed to prevent cross-infection, the colour of which depends upon the grade (or, more recently, band) and gender of the nurse ‚Äì the colour varies between NHS Trusts. The tunics often feature piping around the edges of the uniform. # A dress in the same colour as the tunic-style top. Male nursing uniform In some countries the nurse's uniform is now gender neutral. When this is not the case, male nurses wear a different uniform to their female counterparts. In the UK, male nurses often wear a white tunic with epaulettes in a colour or quantity that represents their year of training or grade. However, in many trusts the white uniform is now obsolete and uniforms are non-gender specific. Nurse uniforms vs. scrubs German nurse in scrubs. Beginning in the 1990s, and until the present time, the traditional nurse uniforms have been replaced with the \\"new\\" scrub dress in some countries. Most hospitals in the US and Europe argue that the scrub uniform is easier to clean than the old nurse uniforms. The nurses who wear the uniforms are divided into two camps: * Those who prefer the new scrubs; disliked the old white nurse dress uniforms. * The nurses who liked the old white nurse dress uniforms; they argue that nurses who wear scrubs are seen by the patients as cleaners or surgeons and cannot be identified as nurses. In many parts of the world, nurses continue to wear a uniform consisting of a dress, pinafore and cap. The traditional white uniform for male nursing staff is now going out of fashion, except for student nurses. A tunic of either the dental surgeon style or a V-neck with a collar is very often used. The colours vary with grade, area of work, and hospital; however, the male equivalent of a sister (that is, charge nurse) tend to be shades of blue or dark green: often, this is the only colour to be recognised by the public as signifying a person in authority. Nursing jewellery Nurses' watch Nurses were actively discouraged from wearing jewellery which might distract from their purpose and get caught on patient skin during care activity. A fob watch or pendant watch is considered synonymous with nursing. The fob watch frees the nurses' hands for client care and prevents the wrist watch becoming a vector for disease. Watches are sometimes given as a token rite-of-passage gift from parents to young nurses, who are making the transition into nurses' quarters and live away from home for the first time.

They are common in primary and secondary schools in various countries. Although often used interchangeably, there is an important distinction between dress codes and school uniforms: according to scholars such as Nathan Joseph, clothing can only be considered a uniform when it \\"(a) serves as a group emblem, (b) certifies an institution's legitimacy by revealing individual's relative positions and (c) suppresses individuality.\\" An example of a uniform would be requiring button-down shirts, long pants for boys and blouses, pleated skirts for girls, with both wearing blazers. A uniform can even be as simple as requiring collared shirts, or restricting colour choices and limiting items students are allowed to wear. A dress code, on the other hand, is much less restrictive, and focuses \\"on promoting modesty and discouraging anti-social fashion statements\\", according to Marian Wilde. Examples of a dress code would be not allowing ripped clothing, no logos or limiting the amount of skin that can be shown. History Schoolboys in France 1880 Japanese Taiwan, 1927. It is difficult to trace the origins of the uniform as there is no comprehensive written history, but rather a variety of known influences. School uniforms are believed to be a practice which dates to the 16th century in the United Kingdom. It is believed that the Christ's Hospital School in England in 1552 was the first school to use a school uniform.Scott, Jenny (5 September 2014). \\"School uniforms: A history of 'rebellion and conformity'.\\" BBC. Retrieved 13 January 2020. Students were given a uniform that most notably consisted of a long blue coat and yellow, knee-high socks. An almost identical uniform is still worn by students attending the school today. The earliest documented proof of institutionalised use of a standard academic dress dates back to 1222 when the then Archbishop of Canterbury ordered the wearing of the cappa clausa. This monastic and academic practice evolved into collegiate uniforms in England, particularly in charity schools where uniform dress was often provided for poor children. Universities, primary schools and secondary schools used uniforms as a marker of class and status. Although school uniforms can often be considered conservative and old-fashioned, uniforms in recent years have changed as societal dress codes have changed. Contemporary A kindergarten schoolboy in Ghana wearing school uniform In many Japanese schools, students are required to take off the shoes they wear outdoors and put on their uwabaki, a kind of soft slipper meant to be used only indoors. In the United States, a movement toward using uniforms in state schools began when Bill Clinton addressed it in the 1996 State of the Union, saying: \\"If it means that teenagers will stop killing each other over designer jackets, then our public schools should be able to require their students to wear uniforms.\\" As of 1998 approximately 25% of all U.S. public elementary, middle and junior high schools had adopted a uniform policy or were considering a policy, and two thirds were implemented between 1995 and 1997. There are an abundance of theories and empirical studies looking at school uniforms, making statements about their effectiveness. These theories and studies elaborate on the benefits and also the shortcomings of uniform policies. The issue of nature vs. nurture comes into play, as uniforms affect the perceptions of masculinity and femininity, over-simplify issues of gender classification, and work to channel, subdue or punish the sexuality of female, male, transgender and intersex.Jane Tynan and Lisa Godson, eds., Uniform: Clothing and Discipline in the Modern World (London: Bloomsbury, 2019), ; Todd A. DeMitchell and Richard Fossey, The Challenges of Mandating School Uniforms in the Public Schools: Free Speech, Research, and Policy (London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2015), ; Esan Regmi, Stories of Intersex People from Nepal (Kathmandu: [n.p.], 2016). Uniforms bring a variety of pros, cons, and major legal implications and controversies. There are two main empirical findings that are most often cited in the political rhetoric surrounding the uniform debate. One of these, the case study of the Long Beach Unified School District, is most often cited in support of school uniforms and their effectiveness whereas Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement is the most frequently cited research in opposition to the implementation of school uniform policies. Indian Mizo school girls at Hnahthial Effects of uniforms on students The case study of the Long Beach Unified School District was the study of the first large, urban school in the United States to implement a uniform policy. In 1994, mandatory school uniforms were implemented for the districts elementary and middle schools as a strategy to address the students' behaviour issues.Reed, Joshua B. \\"Effects of a School Uniform Policy on an Urban School District.\\" Northern Michigan University. N.p., 1 August 2011. Web. 19 April 2015. .Wade, K. K., & Stafford, M. E. (2003). Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions. Education and Urban Society, 35(4), 399‚Äì420. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124503255002 The district simultaneously implemented a longitudinal study to research the effects of the uniforms on student behavior. The study attributed favourable student behavioral changes and a significant drop in school discipline issues to the mandatory uniform policy. This case study attributed the following noticeable outcomes to the use of uniforms throughout the district: *Fewer absences and truancies; *Fewer referrals to the office for behavior problems; *Fewer suspensions and expulsions; Reduced by 28% (elementary) and 36% (middle school); *Decreased crime and vandalism; Reduced by 74% (elementary) and 18% (middle school); Colombian primary school students with their teacher Other research found that uniforms were not an effective deterrent to decrease truancy, did not decrease behavior problems, decrease substance use, and in fact may be associated with poorer student achievement relative to students not required to wear school uniforms. A study suggested that \\"instead of directly affecting specific outcomes, uniforms act as a catalyst for change and provide a highly visible opportunity for additional programs\\" within schools. In fact, Brunsma et al., 1998 considered that this was the case with the Long Beach Unified School District case study as several additional reform efforts were implemented simultaneously with the mandatory uniform policy.Brunsma, David L., and Kerry A. Rockquemore. \\"Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement.\\" The Journal of Educational Research 92.1 (1998): 53-62. Web. 31 March 2015. Brunsma stated that despite the inconclusiveness of the effects of uniforms, they became more common because \\"this is an issue of children's rights, of social control, and one related to increasing racial, class and gender inequalities in our schools.\\"  Laws and rulings  Thai students (uniforms with dark blue shorts) and Singaporean students (uniforms with cyan skirts and shorts) in front of the Grand Palace As uniforms have become more normalised, there have also been an increasing number of lawsuits brought against school districts. According to David Brunsma, one in four public elementary schools and one in eight public middle and high schools in the United States have policies dictating what a student wears to school.Brunsma, David L. Uniforms in Public Schools: A Decade of Research and Debate. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Education, 2006. Print. The school code within states‚Äô constitutions typically asserts that it allows the board of school directors to make reasonable rules and regulations as they see fit in managing the school's affairs. As of 2008, there are currently 23 states that allow school districts to mandate school uniforms.Colasanti, Michael. \\"School Uniforms and Dress Codes: State Policies.\\" StateNote (2008). Education Commission of the States. Education Commission of the States. Web. 19 April 2015. . The constitutional objections usually brought upon school districts tend to fall into one of the following two categories: (1) a violation of the students‚Äô First Amendment right to free expression (2) a violation of parents' right to raise their children without government interference. Although up until this point, The Supreme Court has not ruled on a case involving school uniforms directly, in the 1968 decision Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court ruled that upon entering school, students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech.Kraft, Jacquelyn. Society's Perceptions and Attitudes Toward School Uniforms. Research Paper. University of Wisconsin-Stout. August 2003. Web http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.390.8124&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf. Internationally, there are differing views of school uniforms. In the Australian state of Queensland, Ombudsman Fred Albietz ruled in 1998 that state schools may not require uniforms. In the Philippines, the Department of Education abolished the requirement of school uniforms in public schools. In England and Wales, technically a state school may not permanently exclude students for \\"breaching school uniform policy\\", under a policy promulgated by the Department for Children, Schools and Families but students not wearing the correct uniform are asked to go home and change. In Scotland, some local councils (that have responsibility for delivering state education) do not insist on students wearing a uniform as a precondition to attending and taking part in curricular activities. Turkey abolished mandatory uniforms in 2010. Examples of lawsuits in the United States =Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board= In the Canady v. Bossier Parish School Board lawsuit in 2000, a Louisiana district court ruled in favour of the school board because it did not see how the free speech rights of the students were being violated due to the school board's uniform policy. Even though the plaintiff appealed the decision, the Fifth Circuit Court also ruled in favour of the school board after implementing a four-step system that is still used today. Firstly, a school board has to have the right to set up a policy. Secondly, the policy must be determined to support a fundamental interest of the board as a whole. Thirdly, the guidelines cannot have been set for the purpose of censorship. Finally, the limits on student expression cannot be greater than the interest of the board. As long as these four policies are in place, then no constitutional violation can be claimed.\\"First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case.\\" First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case. First Amendment Schools. Web. 19 April 2015. . =Littlefield v. Forney Independent School District= In the Forney Independent School District of Forney, Texas in 2001, the school board decided to implement a school uniform policy allowing the students to wear a polo shirt, oxford shirt or blouse in four possible colours, and blue or khaki pants or shirts, a skirt or jumper. While there was some flexibility with shoes, certain types were prohibited along with any sort of baggy clothes. The parents of the Littlefield family requested that their son be exempt from the policy, but were denied. In response, the Littlefields filed a lawsuit against the school district, under the pretenses that this uniform mandate infringed on their rights as parents to control how they brought up their children and their education. They even went as far as to cite an infringement on religious freedom, claiming that opting out of the uniforms on the grounds of religion allowed the school to rank the validity of certain religions. Before trial, the District Court dismissed the case, so the family appealed. Ultimately, the Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the students' rights were not being violated even though the claims presented were valid. They ruled that school rules derived from the education would override the parents' right to control their children's upbringing in this specific situation. As far as the religious freedom violation accusations, the court ruled that the policy did not have a religious goal, and thus did not infringe on religious freedom rights.\\"First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case.\\" First Amendment Schools: The Five Freedoms - Court Case. First Amendment Schools. Web. 19 April 2015. =Jacobs v. Clark County School District= In 2003, Liberty High School, a school of the Clark County School District in Henderson, Nevada, implemented a uniform policy of khakis and red, white or blue polo shirts. A junior by the name of Kimberly Jacobs was suspended a total of five times because she wore a religious shirt to school and got cited for uniform violations. Her family sued the Clark County School District under the claims that her First Amendment rights were being infringed upon and that the uniform policy was causing students to be deprived of due process. The plaintiff's requests were for injunctive relief, the expunging of suspensions from Jacob's school record and awarding of damages. The injunction was granted to the family meaning that the school could no longer discipline her for breaking the uniform policy. At this ruling, the school district appealed. The next court ruled on the side of the school district as it determined that the uniform policy was in fact neutral and constitutional, and it dismissed the claims of the plaintiff.\\"Jacobs v.

Washoe County School District= In 2011, a Nevada public elementary school of the Washoe County School District decided to add the school's motto, Tomorrow's Leaders embroidered in small letters on the shirt. In response, Mary and John Frudden, parents of a student sued the school district on the basis of it violating the 1st Amendment. The court ultimately dismissed the case filed by the Fruddens over the uniforms. However, the family appealed, and two years later, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard the case. The court ruled to reverse the previous decision of dismissing the case, and also questioned the apparent policy for students that were part of a nationally recognised group such as Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who were able to wear the uniforms in place of the school ones on regular meeting days. The 9th circuit panel ruled that the school had not provided enough evidence for why it instituted this policy, and that the family was never given a chance to argue.\\"Appeals Court Revives Reno School Uniform Case.\\" Elko Daily.

Kogal culture There are several positive and negative social implications of uniforms on both the students wearing them and society as a whole. Perceptions of masculinity and femininity One of the criticisms of uniforms is that it imposes standards of masculinity and femininity from a young age. Uniforms are considered a form of discipline that schools use to control student behavior and often promote conventional gendered dress.Connell, R. W. \\"Teaching the Boys: New Research on Masculinity, and Gender Strategies for Schools\\".

Boys often are required to wear trousers, belts, and closed-toe shoes and have their shirts tucked in at all times. They are also often required to have their hair cut short. Some critics allege that this uniform is associated with the dress of a professional business man, which, they claim, gives boys at a young age the impression that masculinity is gained through business success.Craik, J.

Skirts are seen by some critics as a symbol of femininity because they restrict movement and force certain ways of sitting and playing. Uniforms that include an apron for girls may suggest that the appropriate feminine societal role is a primarily domestic one. Some girls' school uniforms have been criticized as having an uncomfortable design, which prevents girls from freedom of movement and exposes girls to cold during winter. School uniforms are embedded with gender symbolism. Schools that require students to wear a formal uniform almost universally provide trousers for boys and skirts or dresses for girls. Skirts differentiate the male from the female therefore confirming traditional gender identities for students whom must wear the correct attire corresponding to their sex. Skirts and dresses demand a particular type of feminine gender performance, whereas, trouser demand a particular masculine gender performance. By enforcing that students wear attire that corresponds with their sex inherently assigns the ways a student must perform their gender. This causes controversy when a student does not want to identify with a gender that does not align with their sex. There are rarely guidelines that allow for students to dress according to their performed gender, but almost always according to their sex assigned at birth.

Sexualization of girls A K-pop all-girls band group wearing sexualized Catholic school uniform during a performance, 2017. Around middle or junior school, students begin going through puberty. Uniforms can be seen as a way to restrict the sexualization of girls (rules on hems of skirts, no shoulders). Uniforms take the focus away from sexuality and focus it on academics in a school setting for girls.American Psychological Association, Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. (2007). Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. Retrieved from www.apa.org/pi/wpo/sexualization.html Sometimes the desire to prevent overtly sexualized clothing through uniforms can fail. As an example, miniskirts have been very popular in Japan, where they are common parts of school uniforms and came to be worn within the Kogal culture. \\"The pleasure our culture derives from gazing at girls who look feminine conflicts with girls‚Äô freedom to run around unselfconsciously and to develop their gross motor talents as boys are encouraged to do\\" (Collins et al. 1996, p. 170). Schoolgirl uniforms are used in costumes in the context of \\"Sexy SchoolGirl\\" and are sold on costume sites year round. The idea of the female school uniform has become sexual and in Britain a new survey from Plan International UK found that a third of girls have been sexually harassed while wearing their school uniform. School uniforms can encourage harassment as children, as our culture defines the \\"schoolgirl look\\" to be sexual. Children as young as 8 years old report being victims of, or witnesses to, harassment. Two-thirds of the children questioned in the survey said they have experienced \\"unwanted sexual attention\\" in public, and 35 percent said they have been touched, groped or grabbed without their consent. These experiences teach girls that being harassed by men is just a part of growing up. The perception of schoolgirl uniforms allows for men to harass girls at a young age, causing girls to self-objectify their bodies from the beginning of their schooling experience.

Controversies   General  Indian Mizo school students with their teacher at Hnahthial, Mizoram - they have two sets of uniforms Cuban high schoolgirls, 2009 Pupils in Taiwan Schoolgirls in Liberia In some cultures, the topic of school uniforms has sparked a multitude of controversies and debates over the years. Debates concerning the constitutionality and economic feasibility of uniforms also contribute to the controversy. In the United States, the implementation of school uniforms began following ten years of research indicating the effectiveness of private schools. Some state-school reformers cited this research to support policies linked to private and Catholic school success. Some public-school administrators hence began implementing uniform policies to improve the overall school environment and academic achievement of the students. This is based on the assumption that uniforms are the direct cause of behavioral and academic outcome changes. However, within the Catholic school literature, school uniforms have never been acknowledged as a primary factor in producing a Catholic school effect.The Catholic school effect is the thought that certain elements in a catholic school provide children with a stronger academic educationBrunsma, David L.; Rockquemore, Kerry A. \\"Effects of Student Uniforms on Attendance, Behavior Problems, Substance Use, and Academic Achievement.\\" The Journal of Educational Research 92.1 (1998): 53-62. 31 March 2015. Another area of controversy regarding school uniform and dress code policies revolve around the issue of gender. Nowadays, more teenagers are more frequently \\"dressing to articulate, or confound gender identity and sexual orientation\\", which brings about \\"responses from school officials that ranged from indifferences to applause to bans\\".Hoffman, Jan (6 November 2009). \\"Can a Boy Wear a Skirt to School?\\" The New York Times. In 2009, there were multiple conflicts across the United States arising from disparities between the students' perception of their own gender, and the school administrators' perception of the students' gender identity. Instances include the following:Hoffman, J. (8 November 2009). \\"Can a Boy Wear a Skirt to School?\\" The New York Times. *Spring 2009: Marion County, FL ‚Äì Students must dress \\"in keeping with their gender\\" Boy came to school wearing high-heeled boots, a stuffed bra, and a V-neck T-shirt, he was sent home to change because he was \\"cross-dressing\\" *Aug 2009: Mississippi senior female barred from yearbook because she had posed in a tuxedo. *Oct 2009: Cobb County, GA sent home a boy who favored wigs, makeup, and skinny jeans. *Nov 2009: Cross-dressing Houston senior was sent home because his wig violated the school's dress code rule that a boy's hair may not be \\"longer than the bottom of a regular shirt collar\\" Although not all schools in the United States are required to wear school uniforms, the United States is slowly adapting the use of school uniforms. \\"Almost one in five US public schools required students to wear uniforms during the 2011-2012 school year, up from one in eight in 2003-2004.\\" The ideology of school uniform is that it will create a safer environment for students and help with equality. In some areas uniforms have become essential due to the poverty level that the schools reside in. \\"Mandatory uniform policies in public schools are found more commonly in high-poverty areas.\\" Stephanie Northen of The Guardian wrote that school uniforms are less controversial in the United Kingdom compared to the United States and are usually not opposed on free speech grounds. School girls of Argentina  Positives  English girls in school uniform. Ethiopian school children Advocates of uniforms have proposed multiple reasons supporting their implementation and claiming their success in schools. A variety of these claims have no research supporting them. Some of these pros include the following: Advocates believe that uniforms affect student safety by: *Lowering student victimization *Decrease gang activity and fights Kathleen Wade conducted an experiment to see if bullying and gang presence was higher in uniform or non-uniform schools. The research was done with multiple schools where she gave a questionnaire to both students, and faculty to see if there was a significant difference. Her results showed that bullying and gang presence significantly decreases with students wearing school uniforms.Wade, K. K., & Stafford, M. E. (2003). Public School Uniforms: Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions. Education and Urban Society, 35(4), 399‚Äì420. http://doi.org/10.1177/0013124503255002 *Differentiating strangers from students in school buildings For example, in the first year of the mandatory uniform policy in Long Beach, California, officials reported that fighting in schools decreased by more than 50%, assault and battery by 34%, sex offenses by 74%, and robbery by 66%. Advocates also believe that uniforms increase student learning and positive attitudes toward school through: *Enhanced learning environments *Heightened school pride *Increased student achievement *High levels of preparedness *Conformity to organizational goals *Increased chance of staying in schoolMurray, R. K. (1997). The Impact of School Uniforms on School Climate. NASSP Bulletin, 81(593), 106‚Äì112. http://doi.org/10.1177/019263659708159314 *Increased commitment to learning *Increased use of school setting to the student's advantage Wearing uniforms leads to decreased behavior problems by increasing attendance rates, lowering suspension rates, and decreasing substance use among the student body. Proponents also attribute positive psychological outcomes like increased self-esteem, increased spirit, and reinforced feelings of oneness among students to wearing uniforms. Additional proponent arguments include that school uniforms:Wilde, Marian. The Debate Over Dress Codes and Uniforms (2006): 1-3.Boward Teacher's Union. July 2006. Web. 9 April 201 *Encourage discipline *Help students resist peer pressure to buy trendy clothes *Diminish economic and social barriers between students Currently pros of school uniforms center around how uniforms affect schools' environments. Proponents have found a significant positive impact on school climate, safety, and students‚Äô self-perception from the implementation of uniforms.  Negatives  A Scottish boy's school uniform The opposing side of uniforms has claimed their ineffectiveness using a variety of justifications, a variety of which have research supporting them. Some of the cons to school uniforms include the following legal, financial, and questionable effectiveness concerns: The primary concern with school uniforms or strict dress codes is that it limits the ability of students to express themselves. Clothing is viewed as a mean of expression ‚Äì making all students wear the same clothes or limit them to what they can wear can disrupt their sense of identity. One of the main controversies can lie within Dress Code Policies vs. Freedom of Speech. This establishes that students cannot wear the latest trends, mid- drift, or clothes that the school finds that interrupt the learning environment. However, students can wear clothing artifacts that express their religion. \\"Both the Constitution and most state laws protect students' rights to wear religious attire inool [sic] school, such as the wearing of a turban, yarmulke, or headscarf.\\" Another negative aspect of school uniforms is that it can be sexist. Boys and girls are also not disciplined the same when it comes to dress codes. Girls are more commonly disciplined for \\"certain articles of‚Äô attire that are prohibited because they ‚Äúdistract‚Äù boys. \\"Transgender students have been sent home for wearing clothing different from what's expected of their legalness, while others have been excluded from yearbooks.\\" Uniforms also generally disadvantage students, especially girls, in freedom of movement and comfort. The research was conducted on an Australian independent private school and its uniform. Comfort-wise, for boys, the blazer was too hot/cold and uncomfortable. For girls, the light coloured cotton school dress was restrictive, see-through, hot, uncomfortable, and impractical. Furthermore, the stockings were often cold, grey woolen kilt was too heavy and restrictive of movement, and the wind could cause it to reveal more than the girls wanted. When playing and moving around, for boys, the tie was a choking hazard, and the pants had no stretch. For girls, the dress/skirt caused modesty issues (e.g. hard to swing on monkey bars/run around while keeping her privacy, hence stop being active), and the kilts were are too big and heavy. Research on how school uniforms and school dress codes influence the student can be inconclusive. \\"In the U.S., over half of public schools have a dress code, which frequently outline gender-specific policies.\\" *Legal concerns Focus on the supposition that requiring a uniform violates children's individual rights (Thomas, 1994; Virginia State Dep‚Äôt of Edu, 1992) Mandatory uniform policies are being considered largely for urban school districts, and, hence are being forced on a predominantly minority and poor student population (Thomas, 1994) *No effect on social status  Many students felt the school uniform policy had little impact on the social dynamic of the school and students found ways to express individuality by making minor alterations to the school uniform (Da Costa, 2006DaCosta, K. (2006). Dress code blues: An exploration of urban students' reactions to a public High School uniform policy. The Journal of Negro Education, 75(1), 49-59.). Some parents and students interviewed in a research about the social aspect of school uniforms said that uniforms were a violation of their rights and freedom. \\"Like adults, children's freedom to choose or to act is also circumscribed by the community ‚Äì massively so by schools, with their high density, constant supervision and evaluation, lack of privacy, and the obligatory nature of their activities.\\" (Bodine, 2003Bodine, A. (2003). School uniforms and discourses on childhood. Childhood, 10(1), 43-63.) *Financial concerns Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have voiced concerns about the cost of uniforms, specifically that some disadvantaged parents are unable to afford them (Gursky, 1996) *Questionable effectiveness of those policies Strongest opponents of uniform policies charge that no empirical evidence exists to support the numerous and varied claims of uniform proponents (LaPorte, Holoman, & Alleyne, 1992) School uniforms suppress students‚Äô individuality by mandating standardization of appearance and removing student expression (Joseph, 1986Joseph, Nathan. Uniforms and Nonuniforms: Communication through Clothing. Greenwood Press, New York, NY, 1986. ProQuest. Web. 18 April 2015.) While uniform policies have been linked to school climate, safety, and student self-perception, there is no evidence to indicate that a uniform policy increases academic achievement (Wade & Stafford, 2003Wade, Kathleen Kiley, and Mary E. Stafford. \\"Public School Uniforms. Effect on Perceptions of Gang Presence, School Climate, and Student Self-Perceptions.\\" Education and Urban Society 35.4 (2003): 399-420. ProQuest. Web. 18 April 2015.) According to Marian Wilde, additional opponent arguments include that school uniforms: * Are simply a Band-Aid on the issue of school violence * Make students a target for bullies from other schools * Are an unfair additional expense for parents who pay taxes for a free public education * Are difficult to enforce in state/public (government) schools  See also  * School uniforms by country * Catholic school uniform * Preppy * Uniform fetishism * Schoolbag * Sumptuary law  References   External links  * \\"School Uniforms.\\" Ithaca College WISE: Working to Improve Schools and Education. * Information and Resources: Public School Uniforms * What's in a school uniform?

Most accounts of the events come from Cicero himself. Some modern historians, and ancient sources such as Sallust, suggest that Catiline was a more complex character than Cicero's writings declare, and that Cicero was heavily influenced by a desire to establish a lasting reputation as a great Roman patriot and statesman. This is one of the best- documented events surviving from the ancient world, and has set the stage for classic political struggles pitting state security against civil liberties. Background Running for the consulship for a second time after having lost at the first attempt, Catiline was an advocate for the cancellation of debts and land redistribution. There was apparently substantial evidence that he had bribed numerous senators to vote for him and engaged in other unethical conduct related to the election (such behaviour was, however, hardly unknown in the late Republic). Cicero, in indignation, issued a law prohibiting such machinations,Dio Cassius XXXVII.29.1 and it seemed obvious to all that the law was directed at Catiline. Catiline, therefore, so Cicero claimed, conspired to murder Cicero and other key senators on the day of the election, in what became known as the Second Catilinarian conspiracy. Cicero announced that he had discovered the plan, and postponed the election to give the Senate time to discuss this supposed coup d'√©tat. The day after that originally scheduled for the election, Cicero addressed the Senate on the matter, and Catiline's reaction was immediate and violent. In response to Catiline's behavior, the Senate issued a senatus consultum ultimum, a declaration of martial law. Ordinary law was suspended, and Cicero, as consul, was invested with absolute power. When the election was finally held, Catiline lost again. Anticipating the bad news, the conspirators had already begun to assemble an army, made up mostly of Lucius Cornelius Sulla's veteran soldiers. The nucleus of conspirators was also joined by some senators. The plan was to initiate an insurrection in all of Italy, put Rome to the torch and, according to Cicero, kill as many senators as they could. Through his own investigations, he was aware of the conspiracy. On November 8, Cicero called for a meeting of the Senate in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, near the forum, which was used for that purpose only when great danger was imminent. Catiline attended as well. It was then that Cicero delivered one of his most famous orations.  The First Oration ‚Äì Oratio in Catilinam Prima in Senatu Habita  Cicero Denounces Catiline, fresco by Cesare Maccari, 1882‚Äì1888 As political orations go, it was relatively short, some 3,400 words, and to the point. The opening remarks are still widely remembered and used after 2000 years: Also remembered is the famous exasperated exclamation, O tempora, o mores! (Oh, what times! Oh, what behaviour!). Catiline was present when the speech was delivered. He replied to it by asking people not to trust Cicero because he was a self-made man with no family tradition of public office, and to trust himself because of the long experience of his family. Initially, Cicero's words proved unpersuasive. Catiline then ran from the building, hurling threats at the Senate. Later he left the city and claimed that he was placing himself in self-imposed exile at Marseille, but really went to the camp of Manlius, who was in charge of the army of rebels. The next morning Cicero assembled the people, and gave a further oration.  The Second Oration ‚Äì Oratio in Catilinam Secunda Habita ad Populum  Cicero informed the citizens of Rome that Catiline had left the city not in exile, as Catiline had said, but to join with his illegal army. He described the conspirators as rich men who were in debt, men eager for power and wealth, Sulla's veterans, ruined men who hoped for any change, criminals, profligates and other men of Catiline's ilk. He assured the people of Rome that they had nothing to fear because he, as consul, and the gods would protect the state. This speech was delivered with the intention of convincing the lower class, or common man, that Catiline would not represent their interests and they should not support him. Meanwhile, Catiline joined up with Gaius Manlius, commander of the rebel force. When the Senate was informed of the developments, they declared the two of them public enemies. Antonius Hybrida (Cicero's fellow consul), with troops loyal to Rome, followed Catiline while Cicero remained at home to guard the city.  The Third Oration ‚Äì Oratio in Catilinam Tertia ad Populum  Cicero claimed that the city should rejoice because it had been saved from a bloody rebellion. He presented evidence that all of Catiline's accomplices confessed to their crimes. He asked for nothing for himself but the grateful remembrance of the city and acknowledged that the victory was more difficult than one in foreign lands because the enemies were citizens of Rome.  The Fourth Oration ‚Äì Oratio in Catilinam Quarta in Senatu Habita  End of the 4th Catiliniarian Oration, in a manuscript written by Poggio Bracciolini. Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plut. 48,22, fol. 121r. In his fourth and final argument, which took place in the Temple of Concordia, Cicero establishes a basis for other orators (primarily Cato the Younger) to argue for the execution of the conspirators. As consul, Cicero was formally not allowed to voice any opinion in the matter, but he circumvented the rule with subtle oratory. Although very little is known about the actual debate (except for Cicero's argument, which has probably been altered from its original), the Senate majority probably opposed the death sentence for various reasons, one of which was the nobility of the accused. For example, Julius Caesar argued that exile and disenfranchisement would be sufficient punishment for the conspirators, and one of the accused, Lentulus, was a praetor. However, after the combined efforts of Cicero and Cato, the vote shifted in favor of execution, and the sentence was carried out shortly afterwards. While some historians agree that Cicero's actions, in particular the final speeches before the Senate, may have saved the republic, they also reflect his self- aggrandisement and, to a certain extent envy, probably born out of the fact that he was considered a novus homo, a Roman citizen without noble or ancient lineage.Robert W.

Two week old Douglas fir with seven cotyledons. Mimosa pudica seedling with two cotyledons and the first \\"true\\" leaf with six leaflets. A cotyledon (; \\"seed leaf\\" from Latin cotyledon, from Greek: Œ∫ŒøœÑœÖŒªŒ∑Œ¥œéŒΩ kotylƒìd≈çn, gen.: Œ∫ŒøœÑœÖŒªŒ∑Œ¥œåŒΩŒøœÇ kotylƒìdonos, from Œ∫ŒøœÑœçŒªŒ∑ kot√Ωlƒì \\"cup, bowl\\") is a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant, and is defined as \\"the embryonic leaf in seed-bearing plants, one or more of which are the first to appear from a germinating seed.\\" The number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to classify the flowering plants (angiosperms). Species with one cotyledon are called monocotyledonous (\\"monocots\\"). Plants with two embryonic leaves are termed dicotyledonous (\\"dicots\\"). In the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons are formed during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, are formed post-embryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant. The cotyledon of grasses and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a scutellum and a coleoptile. The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent endosperm. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the plumule (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant). Gymnosperm seedlings also have cotyledons, and these are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with from 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the hypocotyl (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule. Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) seedlings have 5‚Äì9, and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) 7‚Äì13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. Mediterranean cypress always having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for big-cone pinyon (Pinus maximartinezii), with 24 (Farjon & Styles 1997). The cotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the seed. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin photosynthesis, or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling. Epigeal versus hypogeal development Cotyledons may be either epigeal, expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or hypogeal, not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic. The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many nuts and acorns. Hypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones. They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as meristem buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed). The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive. The ultimate development of the epigeal habit is represented by a few plants, mostly in the family Gesneriaceae in which the cotyledon persists for a lifetime. Such a plant is Streptocarpus wendlandii of South Africa in which one cotyledon grows to be up to 75 centimeters (2.5 feet) in length and up to 61 cm (two feet) in width (the largest cotyledon of any dicot, and exceeded only by Lodoicea). Adventitious flower clusters form along the midrib of the cotyledon. The second cotyledon is much smaller and ephemeral. Related plants may show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family. Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the Southern Hemisphere conifer family Araucariaceae, the pea family, Fabaceae, and the genus Lilium (see Lily seed germination types). The frequently garden grown common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is epigeal, while the closely related runner bean, Phaseolus coccineus, is hypogeal. History The term cotyledon was coined by Marcello Malpighi (1628‚Äì1694). John Ray was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to systematics, in Methodus plantarum (1682).Greene, E. L. & Egerton, F. N. (ed.) (1983). Landmarks of Botanical History: Part 2. Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 1019, note 15, . Theophrastus (3rd or 4th century BC) and Albertus Magnus (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.Greene, E. L. & Egerton, F. N. (ed.)

Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet. The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features. As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms. For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on. The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography. In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types. Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography. A region has its own nature that could not be moved. The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.). The second nature is its physical elements complex that were built by people in the past. The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants. Globalization Map of the world as of 2016 Global regions distinguishable from space, and are therefore clearly distinguished by the two basic terrestrial environments, land and water. However, they have been generally recognised as such much earlier by terrestrial cartography because of their impact on human geography. They are divided into largest of land regions, known as continents, and the largest of water regions known as oceans. There are also significant regions that do not belong to either classification, such as archipelago regions that are littoral regions, or earthquake regions that are defined in geology. Continental regions Continental regions are usually based on broad experiences in human history and attempts to reduce very large areas to more manageable regionalization for the purpose of study. As such they are conceptual constructs, usually lacking distinct boundaries. Oceanic division into maritime regions are used in conjunction with the relationship to the central area of the continent, using directions of the compass. Some continental regions are defined by the major continental feature of their identity, such as the Amazon basin, or the Sahara, which both occupy a significant percentage of their respective continental land area. To a large extent, major continental regions are mental constructs created by considering an efficient way to define large areas of the continents. For the most part, the images of the world are derived as much from academic studies, from all types of media, or from personal experience of global exploration. They are a matter of collective human knowledge of its own planet and are attempts to better understand their environments. Regional geography Regional geography is a branch of geography that studies regions of all sizes across the Earth. It has a prevailing descriptive character. The main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region, which consists of natural as well as human elements. Attention is paid also to regionalization, which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions. Regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences (similar to quantitative or critical geographies; for more information, see history of geography). Human geography Human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape human interaction with various discrete environments. It encompasses human, political, cultural, social, and economic aspects among others that are often clearly delineated. While the major focus of human geography is not the physical landscape of the Earth (see physical geography), it is hardly possible to discuss human geography without referring to the physical landscape on which human activities are being played out, and environmental geography is emerging as a link between the two. Regions of human geography can be divided into many broad categories: *Cultural geography *Demography *Development geography *Economic geography *Ethnography *Geopolitics *Health geography *Historical geography *Language geography *Religion geography *Social geography *Time geography *Tourism geography *Transportation geography *Urban geography *Media Geography Historical regions The field of historical geography involves the study of human history as it relates to places and regions or the study of how places and regions have changed over time. D. W. Meinig, a historical geographer of America, describes many historical regions in his book The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History. For example, in identifying European \\"source regions\\" in early American colonization efforts, he defines and describes the Northwest European Atlantic Protestant Region, which includes sub-regions such as the \\"Western Channel Community\\", which itself is made of sub-regions such as the English West Country of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, and Dorset. In describing historic regions of America, Meinig writes of \\"The Great Fishery\\" off the coast of Newfoundland and New England, an oceanic region that includes the Grand Banks. He rejects regions traditionally used in describing American history, like New France, \\"West Indies\\", the Middle Colonies, and the individual colonies themselves (Province of Maryland, for example). Instead he writes of \\"discrete colonization areas,\\" which may be named after colonies but rarely adhere strictly to political boundaries. Historic regions of this type Meinig writes about include \\"Greater New England\\" and its major sub-regions of \\"Plymouth,\\" \\"New Haven shores\\" (including parts of Long Island), \\"Rhode Island\\" (or \\"Narragansett Bay\\"), \\"the Piscataqua,\\" \\"Massachusetts Bay,\\" \\"Connecticut Valley,\\" and to a lesser degree, regions in the sphere of influence of Greater New England, \\"Acadia\\" (Nova Scotia), \\"Newfoundland and The Fishery/The Banks.\\" Other examples of historical regions include Iroquoia, Ohio Country, Illinois Country, and Rupert's Land.  Tourism region  A tourism region is a geographical region that has been designated by a governmental organization or tourism bureau as having common cultural or environmental characteristics. These regions are often named after a geographical, former, or current administrative region or may have a name created for tourism purposes. The names often evoke certain positive qualities of the area and suggest a coherent tourism experience to visitors. Countries, states, provinces, and other administrative regions are often carved up into tourism regions to facilitate attracting visitors. Some of the more famous tourism regions based on historical or current administrative regions include TuscanyTurismo.intoscana.it.

Famous examples of regions created by a government or tourism bureau include the United Kingdom's Lake DistrictLakedistrict.gov.uk, Retrieved 2009-11-25 and California's Wine Country.Winecountry.com, Retrieved 2009-11-25 great plains region Natural resource regions Natural resources often occur in distinct regions. Natural resource regions can be a topic of physical geography or environmental geography, but also have a strong element of human geography and economic geography. A coal region, for example, is a physical or geomorphological region, but its development and exploitation can make it into an economic and a cultural region. Some examples of natural resource regions include the Rumaila Field, the oil field that lies along the border or Iraq and Kuwait and played a role in the Gulf War; the Coal Region of Pennsylvania, which is a historical region as well as a cultural, physical, and natural resource region; the South Wales Coalfield, which like Pennsylvania's coal region is a historical, cultural, and natural region; the Kuznetsk Basin, a similarly important coal mining region in Russia; Kryvbas, the economic and iron ore mining region of Ukraine; and the James Bay Project, a large region of Quebec where one of the largest hydroelectric systems in the world has been developed. Religious regions Sometimes a region associated with a religion is given a name, like Christendom, a term with medieval and renaissance connotations of Christianity as a sort of social and political polity. The term Muslim world is sometimes used to refer to the region of the world where Islam is dominant. These broad terms are very vague when used to describe regions. Within some religions there are clearly defined regions. The Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and others, define ecclesiastical regions with names such as diocese, eparchy, ecclesiastical provinces, and parish. For example, the United States is divided into 32 Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod is organized into 33 geographic districts, which are subdivided into circuits (the Atlantic District (LCMS), for example). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses regions similar to dioceses and parishes, but uses terms like ward and stake. Political regions In the field of political geography, regions tend to be based on political units such as sovereign states; subnational units such as administrative regions, provinces, states (in the United States), counties, townships, territories, etc.; and multinational groupings, including formally defined units such as the European Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and NATO, as well as informally defined regions such as the Third World, Western Europe, and the Middle East. Administrative regions The word \\"region\\" is taken from the Latin regio (derived from regere, to rule), and a number of countries have borrowed the term as the formal name for a type of subnational entity (e.g., the regi√≥n, used in Chile). In English, the word is also used as the conventional translation for equivalent terms in other languages (e.g., the –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å (oblast), used in Russia alongside a broader term —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω). The following countries use the term \\"region\\" (or its cognate) as the name of a type of subnational administrative unit: *Belgium (in French, r√©gion; in German, Region; the Dutch term gewest is often translated as \\"region\\") *Chad (', effective from 2002) *Chile (regi√≥n) *C√¥te d'Ivoire (r√©gion) *Denmark (effective from 2007) *England (not the United Kingdom as a whole) *Eritrea *France (r√©gion) *Ghana *Guinea (r√©gion) *Guinea-Bissau (regi√£o) *Guyana *Hungary (r√©gi√≥) *Italy (regione) *Madagascar (r√©gion) *Mali (r√©gion) *Malta (reƒ°jun) *Namibia *New Zealand *Peru (regi√≥n) *Portugal (regi√£o) *Philippines (rehiyon) *Senegal (r√©gion) *Tanzania *Togo (r√©gion) *Trinidad and Tobago (Regional Corporation) The Canadian province of Qu√©bec also uses the \\"administrative region\\" (r√©gion administrative). Scotland had local government regions from 1975 to 1996. In Spain the official name of the autonomous community of Murcia is Regi√≥n de Murcia. Also, some single-province autonomous communities such as Madrid use the term regi√≥n interchangeably with comunidad aut√≥noma. Two l√§n (counties) in Sweden are officially called 'regions': Sk√•ne and V√§stra G√∂taland, and there is currently a controversial proposal to divide the rest of Sweden into large regions, replacing the current counties. The government of the Philippines uses the term \\"region\\" (in Filipino, rehiyon) when it's necessary to group provinces, the primary administrative subdivision of the country. This is also the case in Brazil, which groups its primary administrative divisions (estados; \\"states\\") into grandes regi√µes (greater regions) for statistical purposes, while Russia uses —ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω—ã (economic regions) in a similar way, as does Romania and Venezuela. The government of Singapore makes use of the term \\"region\\" for its own administrative purposes. The following countries use an administrative subdivision conventionally referred to as a region in English: *Bulgaria, which uses the –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç (oblast) *Russia, which uses the –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å (oblast'), and for some regions the –∫—Ä–∞–π (krai) *Ukraine, which uses the –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å (oblast') *Slovakia (kraj) China has five Ëá™Ê≤ªÂå∫ (z√¨zh√¨q≈´) and two ÁâπÂà•Ë°åÊîøÂçÄ (or ÁâπÂà´Ë°åÊîøÂå∫; t√®bi√©x√≠ngzh√®ngq≈´), which are translated as \\"autonomous region\\" and \\"special administrative region\\", respectively. =Local administrative regions= There are many relatively small regions based on local government agencies such as districts, agencies, or regions. In general, they are all regions in the general sense of being bounded spatial units. Examples include electoral districts such as Washington's 6th congressional district and Tennessee's 1st congressional district; school districts such as Granite School District and Los Angeles Unified School District; economic districts such as the Reedy Creek Improvement District; metropolitan areas such as the Seattle metropolitan area, and metropolitan districts such as the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago, the Las Vegas-Clark County Library District, the Metropolitan Police Service of Greater London, as well as other local districts like the York Rural Sanitary District, the Delaware River Port Authority, the Nassau County Soil and Water Conservation District, and C-TRAN. Traditional or informal regions Regions of Finland The traditional territorial divisions of some countries are also commonly rendered in English as \\"regions\\". These informal divisions do not form the basis of the modern administrative divisions of these countries, but still define and delimit local regional identity and sense of belonging. Examples include: * Finland * Japan * Korea * Norway (landsdeler) * Romania * Slovakia Functional regions Functional regions are usually understood to be the areas organised by the horizontal functional relations (flows, interactions) that are maximised within a region and minimised across its borders so that the principles of internal cohesiveness and external separation regarding spatial interactions are met (see, for instance, Farmer and Fotheringham, 2011; Klapka, Halas, 2016; Smart, 1974). A functional region is not an abstract spatial concept, but to a certain extent it can be regarded as a reflection of the spatial behaviour of individuals in a geographic space. The functional region is conceived as a general concept while its inner structure, inner spatial flows, and interactions need not necessarily show any regular pattern, only selfcontainment. The concept of self-containment remains the only crucial defining characteristic of a functional region. Nodal regions, functional urban regions, daily urban systems, local labour-market areas (LLMAs), or travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) are considered to be special instances of a general functional region that need to fulfil some specific conditions regarding, for instance, the character of the region-organising interaction or the presence of urban cores, (Halas et al., 2015). Military regions In military usage, a region is shorthand for the name of a military formation larger than an Army Group and smaller than an Army Theater or simply Theater. The full name of the military formation is Army Region. The size of an Army Region can vary widely but is generally somewhere between about 1 million and 3 million soldiers. Two or more Army Regions could make up an Army Theater. An Army Region is typically commanded by a full General (US four stars), a Field Marshal, or General of the Army (US five stars), or Generalissimo (Soviet Union), in the US Armed Forces, an Admiral may also command a region. Due to the large size of this formation, its use is rarely employed. Some of the very few examples of an Army Region are each of the Eastern, Western, and southern (mostly in Italy) fronts in Europe during World War II. The military map unit symbol for this echelon of formation (see Military organization and APP-6A) consists of six Xs. Media geography Media geography is a spatio-temporal understanding, brought through different gadgets of media, nowadays, media became inevitable at different proportions and everyone supposed to consumed at different gravity. The spatial attributes are studied with the help of media outputs in shape of images which are contested in nature and pattern as well where politics is inseparable. Media geography is giving spatial understanding of mediated image.

The Committee has its headquarters in Brussels. Reasons given for this include: * the historic and cultural claims for autonomy in many regions all over the EU * strengthening the political and economic situation in those regions The term 'region' as used here includes England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which are non-sovereign countries, referred to as separate countries, even though collectively they form the country known as the United Kingdom they are recognised as countries by the UK Government and are not referred to as regions. Some nation states which have historically had a strong centralized administration have transferred political power to the regions. Examples of this include the devolution of power in the UK (the Scotland Act 1998, the Government of Wales Act 1998) and the current negotiations in France concerning increased autonomy for Corsica. Some other states have traditionally had strong regions, such as the Federal Republic of Germany or the autonomous communities of Spain; yet others have been structured on the basis of national and municipal government with little in between. Competence Regional and local authorities elect delegates to the Committee of the Regions. The Committee is a consultative body, and is asked for its opinion by the Council or the Commission on new policies and legislation in the following areas: * Education * Training * Culture * Public Health * Anti-drug support * Trans-European Networks * Social and Economic Cohesion * Structural Funds On certain issues it works in partnership with the Economic and Social Committee.  Political influence  The politics of regionalism has also had an impact at the pan-European level. The regions of Europe had lobbied for an increased say in EU affairs, especially the German L√§nder. This resulted in the creation by the Maastricht Treaty of the Committee of the Regions, and provision for member states to be represented in the Council by ministers from their regional governments. The Council of Europe also has a congress of local and regional authorities, similar to the EU's Committee of the Regions. Strengthening economic competition between communities further supports the creation of authentic regions within the EU and almost all EU member states recently have or currently are re-organizing their administration to create competitive EU regions. Often these regions better reflect culture and identity and a sense of common interests. Of the major organisations representing the regions of Europe, the Assembly of European Regions (AER) is the largest. Established in 1985, the organisation now brings together over 270 regions from 33 countries, along with 16 interregional associations, across wider Europe. Apart from playing a key role as the regions' political voice on the European stage, AER is a forum for interregional cooperation in numerous areas of regional competence, including economic development, social policy, public health, culture, education and youth. The organisation is also a key defender of the subsidiarity principle in Europe, lobbying for its inclusion in the EU treaties and demanding recognition of the word in dictionaries via the worldwide \\"Subsidiarity is a word\\" movement. Outside EU institutions, the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR-CCRE) is the largest organisation of local and regional government in Europe; its members are national associations of towns, municipalities and regions from over 35 countries. Together these associations represent some 100,000 local and regional authorities. CEMR works to promote a united Europe that is based on local and regional self-government and democracy. To achieve this goal it endeavours to shape the future of Europe by enhancing local and regional contribution, to influence European law and policy, to exchange experience at local and regional level and to cooperate with partners in other parts of the world.

His pontificate occurred during the Eastern Roman domination of the papacy. He was the fourth former apocrisiarius to Constantinople to be elected pope. Apocrisiariat Sabinian was born at Blera (Bieda) near Viterbo. He had been sent by Pope Gregory I, who had a high opinion of him, as apocrisiarius to the imperial court in Constantinople. In 595, Gregory was angered by Sabinian's lack of resolution in discussion with Emperor Maurice about the disputed assumption of the title \\"ecumenical patriarch\\" by John IV of Constantinople. Sabinian was then recalled and sent on a mission to Gaul the same year. He returned to Rome in 597. Pontificate Sabinian was elected to succeed Gregory probably in March 604, but had to wait for imperial ratification before being consecrated in September. During his pontificate, Sabinian was seen as a counterfoil to Gregory I. The Liber pontificalis praises him for \\"filling the church with clergy\\", in contrast to Gregory, who tended to fill ecclesiastical positions with monks. Sabinian incurred unpopularity by his unseasonable economies, although the Liber pontificalis states that he distributed grain during a famine at Rome under his pontificate. Whereas Gregory distributed grain to the Roman populace as invasion loomed, when the danger had passed Sabinian sold it to them. Because he was unable or unwilling to allow the people to have the grain for little or nothing, there grew up in later times a number of legends in which his predecessor was represented punishing him for avarice. Sabinian died 22 February 606. His funeral procession through the city had to change course to avoid hostile Romans.\\"The 65th Pope\\", Spirituality.org, Diocese of Bridgeport Onofrio Panvinio, in his 1557 Epitome pontificum Romanorum, attributes to Sabinian the introduction of the custom of ringing bells at the canonical hours and the celebration of the Eucharist.

He inherited control of the warlord regime established by his elder brother, Sun Ce, in 200. He declared formal independence and ruled from 222 to 229 as the King of Wu and from 229 to 252 as the Emperor of Wu. Unlike his rivals Cao Cao and Liu Bei, Sun Quan was much younger than they were and governed his state mostly separate of politics and ideology. He is sometimes portrayed as neutral considering he adopted a flexible foreign policy between his two rivals with the goal of pursuing the greatest interests for the country. Sun Quan was born while his father Sun Jian served as the adjutant of Xiapi County. After Sun Jian's death in the early 190s, he and his family lived at various cities on the lower Yangtze River, until Sun Ce carved out a warlord regime in the Jiangdong region, based on his own followers and a number of local clan allegiances. When Sun Ce was assassinated by the retainers of Xu Gong in 200, the 18-year-old Sun Quan inherited the lands southeast of the Yangtze River from his brother. His administration proved to be relatively stable in those early years as Sun Jian and Sun Ce's most senior officers, such as Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, and Cheng Pu supported the succession. Thus throughout the 200s, Sun Quan, under the tutelage of his able advisers, continued to build up his strength along the Yangtze River. In early 207, his forces finally won complete victory over Huang Zu, a military leader under Liu Biao, who dominated the middle Yangtze. Huang Zu was killed in battle. In winter of that year, the northern warlord Cao Cao led an army of approximately 220,000 to conquer the south to complete the reunification of China. Two distinct factions emerged at his court on how to handle the situation. One, led by Zhang Zhao, urged surrender whilst the other, led by Zhou Yu and Lu Su, opposed capitulation. Eventually, Sun Quan decided to oppose Cao Cao in the middle Yangtze with his superior riverine forces. Allied with Liu Bei and employing the combined strategies of Zhou Yu and Huang Gai, they defeated Cao Cao decisively at the Battle of Red Cliffs. In 220, Cao Pi, King of Wei, Cao Cao's son and successor, seized the throne and proclaimed himself to be the Emperor of China, ending and succeeding the nominal rule of the Han dynasty. At first Sun Quan nominally served as a Wei vassal with the Wei-created title of King of Wu, but after Cao Pi demanded that he send his son Sun Deng as a hostage to the Wei capital Luoyang and he refused, in 222, he declared himself independent by changing his era name. It was not until the year 229 that he formally declared himself emperor. After the death of his original crown prince, Sun Deng, two opposing factions supporting different potential successors slowly emerged. When Sun He succeeded Sun Deng as the new crown prince, he was supported by Lu Xun and Zhuge Ke, while his rival Sun Ba was supported by Quan Cong and Bu Zhi and their clans. Over a prolonged internal power struggle, numerous officials were executed, and Sun Quan harshly settled the conflict between the two factions by exiling Sun He and forcing Sun Ba to commit suicide. Sun Quan died in 252 at the age of 70. He enjoyed the longest reign among all the founders of the Three Kingdoms and was succeeded by his son, Sun Liang. The Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) describes Sun Quan as a tall man with bright eyes and oblong face. He was known as a wise and outgoing man who was fond of making jokes and playing tricks. Because of his skill in valuing the strength of his subordinates and avoiding their shortcomings, as well as treating them like his family, Sun Quan was able to delegate authority to capable figures. This primary strength served him well in gaining the support of the common people and surrounding himself with capable generals. Early life and career The Records of the Three Kingdoms mentioned that Sun Jian was a descendant of Sun Wu (better known as Sun Tzu), a militarist in the Spring and Autumn Period and the author of The Art of War. Sun Quan was born in 182, while his father Sun Jian was still a low-ranking official of the Han dynasty. In 184, two years after Sun Quan was born, the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jue broke out across the country. Sun Jian joined the general Zhu Jun to quell the rebellion and allocated his family to stay in Shouchun. When Sun Quan's elder brother Sun Ce met Zhou Yu in 189, Sun Ce decided to take his mother Lady Wu and younger brothers to Shu County, Zhou Yu's hometown. There, the Sun family became acquainted with Zhou Yu. After Sun Jian's death in 191, the Sun family moved again to Jiangdu in order to mourn him. Two years later, Sun Ce decided to join Yuan Shu's army so he ordered L√º Fan to take his family members to his maternal uncle Wu Jing's home in Danyang. However, Liu Yao, the Governor () of Yang Province became angry when Sun Ce and Yuan Shu defeated Lu Kang, the administrator of Lujiang in 194. He felt worried that they would attack him further so he drove Wu Jing away from Danyang. Since Suan Quan and his mother were still in Liu Yao's territory, Zhu Zhi sent people to rescue them. Sun Quan and his mother moved to Fuling later. When Sun Ce defeated Liu Yao in 195, he ordered Chen Bao to bring his family back to Danyang. As Sun Quan grew up, he served his brother during the conquests of the region south of the Yangtze River. He was made Yangxian County magistrate in 196, at the age of 14, and continued to rise through the ranks as his brother gave him more and more important tasks. Since he was passionate about gathering the retainers like Pan Zhang and Zhou Tai, his fame soon approached his father and elder brother. Zhu Ran and Hu Zong, the men he met during his schooldays, later became ministers of Eastern Wu. He was loved by his brother Sun Ce, who said that he would put his men under Sun Quan's management in the future. In 199, Sun Quan was promoted to the rank of Colonel () and followed his brother to conquer Lujiang and Yuzhang. While Cao Cao attempted to further reinforce the alliance with Sun Ce, both Sun Quan and his younger brother Sun Yi were invited to be officials in Xuchang, but they refused. Succeeding Sun Ce Sun Ce was assassinated in 200 during a hunt. On his deathbed, he knew that his son was still too young to be considered a realistic heir, so he entrusted the 18-year-old Sun Quan to his faithful subordinates. Initially, Sun Quan mourned his brother's death so much that he couldn't stop crying, but at Zhang Zhao's behest, he dressed himself in military uniform and set out to visit the commanderies under his brother's control. Many of Sun Ce's subordinates thought that Sun Quan was too young to sustain Sun Ce's domain and wanted to leave. Particularly, Li Shu, the Administrator of Lujiang, defected to Cao Cao. Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to state Li Shu's crime then headed his troops to defeat Li Shu and regain Lujiang. Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu saw special qualities in the young man and chose to stay to serve Sun Quan. Zhang Hong, whom Sun Ce had earlier sent as a liaison to the warlord Cao Cao, also returned from Cao's domain to assist Sun Quan. At Zhang Hong's request, Cao Cao, in the name of Emperor Xian who was controlled by Cao Cao at the time, commissioned Sun Quan as General Who Attacks Barbarians (), a title under which he would be known for a long time. He listened carefully to his mother Lady Wu's encouraging words, and greatly trusted Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong with regard to civilian affairs and Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, and L√º Fan with regard to military matters. Sun Quan also sought out talented young men to serve as his personal advisors, and it was around this time that he befriended Lu Su and Zhuge Jin, who would later play prominent roles in his administration. In addition, Lu Xun, Bu Zhi, Gu Yong, Shi Yi, Yan Jun, Xu Sheng and Zhu Huan also became his men. Throughout this period and decades to come, Sun Quan's leadership would be characterised by his ability to find men of character and entrust important matters to him, and his ability to react swiftly to events. For the next several years, Sun Quan was largely interested in expanding against the Shanyue, hill tribes which controlled the most southern part of China and outside the reach of the Han government, in order to ensure his realm. Sun Quan launched numerous campaigns against the Shanyue. In 206, he conquered the fortress of Shanyue in Matun and Baodun and captured more than 10,000 men. Furthermore, he gradually sought to harass and weaken Liu Biao's key subordinate, Huang Zu (who controlled the northeastern region of Liu Biao's domain) ‚Äì particularly because Huang Zu had killed his father in battle. He made war on Huangzu twice in 203 and 207. In 208, he was finally able to defeat and kill Huang Zu in battle, and as a result, he obtained the most of the territory of Jiangxia. Soon after, Liu Biao died while Cao Cao was preparing a major campaign to subjugate both Liu Biao and Sun Quan under his control, precipitating a major confrontation. Battle of Red Cliffs chariots and cavalry, from Dahuting Tomb (ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Êº¢Â¢ì) of the late Eastern Han dynasty (25-220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan At the end of 208. After Liu Biao's death, a succession struggle for his domain came into being, between his sons Liu Qi and younger son Liu Cong, whom Liu Biao's second wife Lady Cai favoured (because he had married her niece). After Huang Zu's death, Liu Qi was therefore given Huang's post as the governor of Jiangxia Commandery. Liu Cong therefore succeeded Liu Biao after his death, and Liu Qi was displeased and considered, but did not carry out, an attack against his brother. Nevertheless, Liu Cong, in fear of having to fight Cao Cao and his brother on two fronts, surrendered to Cao Cao against the advice of Liu Biao's key ally Liu Bei. Liu Bei, unwilling to submit to Cao Cao, fled south. Cao caught up to him and crushed his forces, but Liu Bei escaped with his life; he fled to Dangyang. Cao Cao took over most of Jing Province, and appeared set on finally unifying the empire. Sun Quan was well aware of Cao Cao's intentions, and he quickly entered into an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi to prepare for an attack by Cao. Cao Cao wrote Sun Quan with a letter intending to intimidate, and in face of Cao's overwhelming force (estimated to be about 220,000 men, although Cao claimed 800,000, against Sun's 30,000 and the Lius' combined force of 10,000), many of Sun's subordinates, including Zhang Zhao, advocated surrender. Sun Quan refused, under advice from Zhou Yu and Lu Su that Cao Cao would surely not tolerate him even if he surrendered. Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in charge of his 30,000 men, largely stationed on naval ships, and Zhou set up a defensive position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army was stationed on land. About this time, there was a plague developing in Cao Cao's forces which significantly weakened it. Zhou Yu set up a trap where he pretended to be punishing his subordinate Huang Gai, and Huang pretended to surrender to Cao Cao in fear. Zhou Yu then sent ships under Huang Gai's command to pretend to surrender and, as Huang's ships approached Cao Cao's fleet, they were set aflame to assault Cao's fleet, and Cao's fleet was largely destroyed by fire. Cao Cao led his forces to escape on land, but much of the force was destroyed by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's land forces. Uneasy alliance with Liu Bei Statue of Sun Quan. Immediately after Cao Cao withdrew, Sun Quan took over the northern half of Jing Province. Liu Bei marched south and took over the southern half. The Sun-Liu alliance was further cemented by a marriage of Sun Quan's younger sister, Lady Sun, to Liu Bei. Zhou Yu was suspicious of Liu Bei's intentions, however, and suggested to Sun Quan that Liu be seized and put under house arrest (albeit be very well- treated) and his forces be merged into Sun's; Sun Quan, believing that Liu Bei's forces would rebel if he did that, declined. Sun Quan did agree to Zhou Yu's plans to consider attacking Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu (who controlled the modern southern Shaanxi) to try to take over their territories, but after Zhou Yu died in 210, the plans were abandoned. However, Sun Quan was able to persuade the warlords in Jiao Province to submit to him, and they became part of his domain. He then yielded parts of northern Jing Province to Liu Bei as well, agreeing with Liu that the south was insufficient to supply his troops. At the same time, Sun Quan appointed his subordinate Bu Zhi as the Inspector () of Jiao Province to replace Lai Gong. Shi Xie led his followers to submit to Bu Zhi's governorship. Sun Quan took over the entire Jiao Province. In 211, Sun Quan moves his headquarters from Dantu to the city of Moling, and in the next year he rebuilt the walls and renamed the city Jianye. This new location gave him better control of the Yangtze River and better communications with his various other commanders. He also constructed fortresses at Ruxu, since L√º Meng anticipated an invasion there from Cao Cao. The invasion L√º Meng expected came at the start of 213. Sun Quan personally led the army there to resist Cao Cao and relied heavily on the fortresses L√º Meng built to give his soldiers strong positions from which to defend. At one point, Cao Cao tried to send his navy across the river to break Sun Quan's lines, but Sun Quan's own ships surrounded them and destroyed them. Due to the stalemate in the war, Sun Quan drove a big ship to enter the military camp of Cao cao on the other side of Yangtze River to observe his enemy situation. Cao Cao was very impressed with the military discipline of his opponent so he said that he should have a child like Sun Quan and didn't launch an attack on this occasion. Sun Quan ordered people to play music on the ship and returned to his camp safely. Ultimately, L√º Meng's defences held and Sun Quan wrote a letter to Cao Cao to warn that the spring rains would come a month later, Cao Cao had to take his advice and pull back. After Cao Cao's defeat at Ruxu, many people along the Yangtze River fled south to join Sun Quan. With the exception of Wan County and the immediate area, the region became abandoned. In 214, Cao Cao sent a man named Zhu Guang to Wan County with orders to revitalise the region and bring it under Cao Cao's control. Zhu Guang began extensive agricultural projects, and he also stirred up bandits and malcontents into rebellion in Sun Quan's territory. L√º Meng feared that if Zhu Guang's programmes were successful, it would make Cao Cao's hold in the area unbreakable and urged for a campaign against Huan. Sun Quan followed L√º Meng's strategy and used the seasonal flooding to travel to the city by boat, which allowed them to attack unexpectedly. Rather than a lengthy siege, L√º Meng, Gan Ning and Ling Tong led a quick strike and broke Zhu Guang's defences, capturing the city. After Liu Bei's conquest of Yi Province, he was able to supply his troops on his own, so Sun Quan sent Lu Su as an emissary to demand for the return of Jing Province, but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then sent L√º Meng and Ling Tong to lead 20,000 men to attack southern Jing Province and they succeeded in capturing Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling commanderies. Meantime, Lu Su and Gan Ning advanced to Yiyang () with 10,000 men (to block Guan Yu) and took over command of the army at Lukou (). Liu Bei personally went to Gong'an County and Guan Yu led 30,000 men to Yiyang. When an all-out war was about to break out, the news that Cao Cao planned to attack Hanzhong was received by Liu Bei, and he requested for a border treaty with Sun Quan as he became worried about Cao Cao seizing Hanzhong. Liu Bei asked Sun Quan to give him back Lingling Commandery and create a diversion for Cao Cao by attacking Hefei; in return, Liu Bei ceded Changsha and Guiyang commanderies to Sun Quan, setting the new border along the Xiang River. Sun Quan's attack on Hefei was disastrous - he was nearly captured on one occasion, if not saved by Ling Tong. In 217, Cao Cao brought a massive army to attack Ruxu again. Sun Quan personally led 70,000 men to defend the city, though he left actual command of the battle to L√º Meng. It was a furious campaign, and after several weeks of gruelling battle, L√º Meng's defences held and the spring floods forced Cao Cao to retreat once again. Still, this was not a complete victory. Most of Cao Cao's army was still intact and he had a huge force under Xiahou Dun north of Sun Quan's position. This resulted in a stalemate in which as long as Sun Quan kept his army in Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could not hope to invade him; but as soon as Sun Quan pulled out of Ruxu, Xiahou Dun could break through. Also, Xiahou Dun's force was simply too large and too well-entrenched to be driven away. Sun Quan had no military options, so he settled on a diplomatic solution. In 217, Sun Quan allied with Cao Cao, recognising him as the legitimate representative of the Han central government. While officially this was a surrender, Cao Cao knew that Sun Quan would not be content with being treated like a subject, so he confirmed all of the titles Sun Quan had claimed for himself and formalised his control over the lands he held. Sun Quan was permitted to continue to rule independently but was now officially one of Cao Cao's subordinates. Breaking of alliance with Liu Bei In 219, Guan Yu advanced north, attacking Fancheng, scoring a major victory over Cao Ren. While Fancheng did not fall at this time, Guan Yu put it under siege, and the situation was severe enough that Cao Cao considered moving the capital away from Xu. However, Sun Quan, resentful of Guan Yu's prior constant instigation of hostilities (including seizing Sun's food supplies to use for his campaign north), took the opportunity to attack Guan from the rear, and Guan's forces collapsed. Guan Yu was captured by forces under L√º Meng and Jiang Qin; Guan Yu was executed, Jing Province came under Sun's control, and the Sun-Liu alliance ended. After Cao Cao's death in 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to yield the throne to him, ending the Han dynasty and establishing the state of Cao Wei. Sun Quan did not immediately submit to Wei or declare independence after Cao Pi's enthronement, but took a wait-and-see attitude; by contrast, in early 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, establishing the state of Shu Han. Immediately, Liu Bei planned a campaign against Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu. After attempting to negotiate peace and receiving no positive response from Liu Bei, fearing attack on both sides, Sun Quan became a vassal of Wei. Cao Pi's strategist Liu Ye suggested that Cao Pi decline ‚Äî and in fact attack Sun Quan on a second front, effectively partitioning Sun's domain with Shu, and then eventually seek to destroy Shu as well. Cao Pi declined, in a fateful choice that most historians believe doomed his empire to ruling only the northern and central China ‚Äî and this chance would not come again. Indeed, against Liu Ye's advice, on 23 September 221 he appointed Sun Quan the King of Wu and granted him the nine bestowments. In 222, at the Battle of Xiaoting, Sun Quan's general Lu Xun dealt Liu Bei a major defeat, stopping the Shu offensive. Shu would not again pose a threat to Sun Quan from that point on. Later that year, when Cao Pi demanded that Sun Quan send his crown prince Sun Deng to the Wei capital Luoyang as a hostage (to guarantee his loyalty), Sun Quan refused and declared independence (by changing era name), thus establishing Eastern Wu as an independent state. Cao Pi launched a major attack on Wu, but after Wei defeats in early 223, it became clear that Wu was secure. After Liu Bei's death later that year, Zhuge Jin's brother Zhuge Liang, the regent for Liu Bei's son and successor Liu Shan, reestablished the alliance with Sun Quan, and the two states would remain allies until Shu's eventual destruction in 263. Early reign Portrait of Sun Quan by Yan Liben Early in Sun Quan's reign, the Wu administration was known for its efficiency, as Sun showed a knack for listening to correct advice and for delegating authorities to the proper individuals. For example, he correctly trusted the faithful Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin, so much so that he made a duplicate imperial seal and left it with Lu Xun; whenever he would correspond with Shu's emperor Liu Shan or regent Zhuge Liang, he would deliver the letter to Lu Xun first (as Lu's post was near the Shu border), and then if, in Lu's opinion, changes were needed, he would revise the letter and then restamp it with Sun's imperial seal. Further, Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were authorised to coordinate their actions with Shu without prior imperial approval. Sun Quan treated his high-level officials as friends and addressed them accordingly (with courtesy names), and in accordance they dedicated all effort to Wu's preservation. He also knew what were the proper roles for officials that he trusted; for example, in 225, when selecting a chancellor, while the key officials all respected Zhang Zhao greatly and wanted him to be chancellor, Sun Quan declined, reasoning that while he respected Zhang greatly, a chancellor needed to handle all affairs of state, and Zhang, while capable, had such strong opinions that he would surely be in conflict with Sun Quan and other officials at all times. He also repeatedly promoted his official L√º Fan even though, while he was young, L√º Fan had informed to Sun Ce about his improper spending habits, understanding that L√º did so only out of loyalty to Sun Ce. In 224 and 225, Cao Pi again made attacks on Wu, but each time the Wu forces were able to repel Wei's with fair ease ‚Äî so easily that Cao Pi made the comment, \\"Heaven created the Yangtze to divide the north and south.\\" However, Sun Quan was himself equally unsuccessful in efforts to make major attacks on Wei. After Cao Pi's death in 226, for example, Sun Quan launched an attack on Wei's Jiangxia Commandery, but was forced to withdraw as soon as Wei reinforcements arrived. However, later that year, he was able to increase his effective control over Jiao Province when his general L√º Dai was able to defeat the warlord Shi Hui () and end the effective independence that the Shi clan had. In addition, the several independent kingdoms in modern Cambodia, Laos, and southern Vietnam all became Wu vassals as well. Mirror with Immortals and Mythical Beast. Cast in 229, the year Sun Quan declared himself emperor. The Book of Liang records the arrival in 226 of a merchant from the Roman Empire (Daqin) at Jiaozhi (Chinese- controlled northern Vietnam). The Prefect of Jiaozhou sent him to the court of Sun Quan in Nanjing.Gary K. Young (2001), Rome's Eastern Trade: International Commerce and Imperial Policy, 31 BC - AD 305, , p. 29. Sun Quan requested that he provide him with a report on his native country and its people. An expedition was mounted to return the merchant along with 10 female and 10 male \\"blackish coloured dwarfs\\" he had requested as a curiosity and a Chinese officer who, unfortunately, died en route. The one major victory that Wu would have over Wei during this period came in 228, when, with Sun Quan's approval, his general Zhou Fang pretended to be surrendering to Wei after pretending to have been punished repeatedly by Sun Quan. This tricked the Wei general Cao Xiu, who led a large army south to support Zhou Fang. He walked into the trap set by Zhou Fang and Lu Xun and suffered major losses, but was saved from total annihilation by Jia Kui. In 229, Sun Quan declared himself emperor, which almost damaged the alliance with Shu, as many Shu officials saw this as a sign of betrayal of the Han dynasty ‚Äî to which Shu claimed to be the legitimate successor. However, Zhuge Liang opposed ending the alliance and in fact confirmed it with a formal treaty later that year, in which the two states pledged to support each other and divide Wei equally if they could conquer it. Later that year, he moved his capital from Wuchang to Jianye, leaving his crown prince Sun Deng, assisted by Lu Xun, in charge of the western parts of Eastern Wu. Middle reign In 230, however, the first sign of the deterioration of Sun Quan's reign occurred. That year, he sent his generals Wei Wen () and Zhuge Zhi () with a navy of 10,000 into the East China Sea to seek the legendary islands of Yizhou () and Danzhou (), likely Taiwan or Ryukyu, to seek to conquer them, despite strenuous opposition of Lu Xun and Quan Cong. The navy was not able to locate Danzhou but located Yizhou, and returned in 231 after capturing several thousand men ‚Äî but only after 80-90% of the navy had died from illness. Instead of seeing his own fault in this venture, Sun Quan simply executed Wei Wen and Zhuge Zhi. Perhaps concerned about this deterioration in Sun Quan's judgment, Sun Deng left the western empire in Lu Xun's hands in 232 and returned to Jianye, and would remain at Jianye until his own death in 241. In 232, Sun Quan had another misadventure involving his navy ‚Äî as he sent his generals Zhou He () and Pei Qian () to the nominal Wei vassal Gongsun Yuan, in control of Liaodong Commandery, to purchase horses, against the advice of Yu Fan - and indeed, he exiled Yu Fan to the desolate Cangwu Commandery (roughly modern Wuzhou, Guangxi) as punishment. Just as Yu Fan predicted, however, the venture would end in failure ‚Äî as Zhou He and Pei Qian, on their way back, were intercepted by Wei forces and killed. Regretting his actions, Sun Quan tried to recall Yu Fan back to Jianye, only to learn that Yu had died in exile. The next year, however, Sun Quan would have yet another misadventure in his dealings with Gongsun Yuan, as Gongsun sent messengers to him, offering to be his subject. Sun Quan was ecstatic, and appointed Gongsun Yuan the Prince of Yan and granted him the nine bestowments, and further sent a detachment of 10,000 men by sea north to assist Gongsun Yuan in his campaign against Wei, against the advice of nearly every single one of his high-level officials, particularly Zhang Zhao. Once the army arrived, however, Gongsun Yuan betrayed them, killing Sun Quan's officials Zhang Mi () and Xu Yan (), whom Sun had sent to grant the bestowments and seized their troops. Once that happened, the enraged Sun Quan wanted to personally head north with a fleet to attack Gongsun Yuan, and initially, not even Lu Xun's opposition was able to stop him, although he eventually calmed down and did not follow through. To his credit, he also personally went to Zhang Zhao's house and apologised to him. Further, despite the deterioration in his previous clear thinking, he was still capable of making proper decisions at times. For example, in 235, when, as a sign of contempt, Wei's emperor Cao Rui offered horses to him in exchange for pearls, jade, and tortoise shells, Sun Quan ignored the implicit insult and made the exchange, reasoning that his empire needed horses much more than pearls, jade or tortoise shells. In 234, in coordination with Zhuge Liang's final northern expedition against Wei, Sun Quan personally led a major attack against Wei's border city Hefei, while having Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin attack Xiangyang, with the strategy of trying to attract Wei relief forces and then attacking them. However, Wei generals correctly saw the situation and simply let Sun Quan siege Hefei. Only after Sun Quan's food supplies ran low did Cao Rui personally arrive with reinforcements, and Sun withdrew, as did Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin. In 238, when Gongsun Yuan was under attack by Wei's general Sima Yi, Sun Quan, despite his prior rage against Gongsun, correctly judged the situation as one where he might be able to take advantage if Sima Yi were initially unsuccessful, so he did not immediately refuse Gongsun's request for help. However, as Sima Yi was able to conquer Gongsun Yuan quickly, Sun Quan never launched the major attack that he considered if Sima got stuck in a stalemate with Gongsun. That year, he also recognised how L√º Yi, the supervisor of the audit bureau, had been abusing his powers, and had L√º Yi executed; he then further confirmed his trust in the high-level officials by personally writing an emotional letter to Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran, and L√º Dai, blaming himself for the recent problems with his administration while urging them to speak out honestly whenever they saw faults in him. In 241, Sun Quan would launch the last major assault against Wei of his reign, in light of Cao Rui's death in 239, but he rejected a strategy offered by Yin Zha () to attack Wei in coordinated effort with Shu on four different fronts, and the campaign ended in failure as well. Late reign Later in 241, the crown prince Sun Deng died ‚Äî an event that left open the issue of succession and appeared to mark the start of a precipitous decline in Sun Quan's mental health. In 242, he appointed his son Sun He, born to Consort Wang, crown prince. However, he also favoured another son by Consort Wang, Sun Ba, and permitted Sun Ba to have the same staffing level as the crown prince ‚Äî a move that was objected to by a number of officials as encouraging Sun Ba to compete with Sun He, but Sun Quan did not listen to them. After 245, when Sun He and Sun Ba began to have separate residences, their relationship deteriorated further, and Sun Ba began to scheme at how to seize heir status from Sun He. Fanned by gossip from his daughter Sun Luban, Sun Quan blamed Sun He's mother Consort Wang for this ‚Äî and she died in fear. He also cut off Sun He and Sun Ba's access to the officials who supported them in hopes of receiving future favours, but this could not stop Sun Ba's machinations. Indeed, when Lu Xun tried to intervene to protect Sun He, Sun Ba falsely accused him of many crimes, and Sun Quan became provoked so much that he repeatedly rebuked Lu Xun, causing him to die in frustration. In 250, fed up with Sun Ba's constant attacks against Sun He, Sun Quan carried out an inexplicable combination of actions, He forced Sun Ba to commit suicide, while deposing Sun He (who had not been shown to have committed any crimes), and instead creating his youngest son, Sun Liang, crown prince to replace Sun He. This move was opposed by his son-in-law Zhu Ju (the husband of Sun Quan's daughter Sun Luyu), but Zhu Ju's pleas not only did not help Sun He, but also resulted in his own death, as Sun Quan forced him to commit suicide. Many other officials who also opposed the move, as well as officials who had supported Sun Ba, were executed. Around this time, Sun Quan also had his generals destroy a number of levees near the border with Wei, creating large areas of flooding, in order to obstruct potential attacks from Wei. In 251, Sun Quan created the first empress of his reign ‚Äî Sun Liang's mother Consort Pan (previously, he had a succession of wives, but never made any of them empress, except for his favourite, Lady Bu, who was created empress posthumously after her death in 238). Later that year, however, he realised that Sun He was blameless and wanted to recall him from his exile, but was persuaded not to do so by his daughter Sun Luban and Sun Jun, who had supported Sun Liang's ascension. He realised that he was getting very old (69 by this point) and, at Sun Jun's recommendation, commissioned Zhuge Jin's son Zhuge Ke as the future regent for Sun Liang, even though he correctly had misgivings about how Zhuge Ke was arrogant and had overly high opinions of his own abilities. At that time virtually the entire empire, awed by Zhuge's prior military victories, was convinced that Zhuge would be the correct choice for regent. In 252, as Sun Quan neared death, Empress Pan was murdered, but how she was murdered remains a controversy. Wu officials claimed that her servants, unable to stand her temper, strangled her while she was asleep, while a number of historians, including Hu Sanxing, the commentator to Sima Guang's Zizhi Tongjian, believed that top Wu officials were complicit, as they feared that she would seize power as empress dowager after Sun Quan's death. On 21 May 252, Sun Quan died at the age of 70 (by East Asian age reckoning), and Sun Liang succeeded him. Sun Quan was buried in August or September 252 in a mausoleum at the Purple Mountain in Jianye.

The law was enacted on March 2, 1867, over the veto of President Andrew Johnson. It purported to deny the president the power to remove any executive officer who had been appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate, unless the Senate approved the removal during the next full session of Congress.Tenure of Office Act, March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 430, ch. 154; https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35112200623595;view=1up;seq=474 Johnson's attempt to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office without the Senate's approval led to the impeachment of Johnson in early 1868 for violating the act. The act was significantly amended on April 5, 1869, by Congress with President Ulysses S. Grant. Congress repealed the act in its entirety in 1887, exactly 20 years after the law was enacted. While evaluating the constitutionality of a similar law in Myers v. United States (1926), the Supreme Court stated that the Tenure of Office Act was likely invalid. Background In the post-Civil War political environment, President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat who had served as Abraham Lincoln's second vice president, endorsed the quick re-admission of the Southern secessionist states. The two- thirds Republican majorities of both houses of Congress, however, passed laws over Johnson's vetoes, establishing a series of five military districts overseeing newly created state governments. This \\"Congressional Reconstruction\\" was designed to create local civil rights laws to protect newly freed slaves; to protect and patrol the area; to ensure the secessionist states would show some good faith before being readmitted; to ensure Republican control of the states; and, arguably, to inflict some punishment on the secessionists. States would be readmitted gradually. Overpowered politically, Johnson could apply the sole check to the Congressional Reconstruction plan of his control (as commander-in-chief) of the military, which would be the primary institution enforcing the plan's provisions. Even Johnson's control of the military was, however, inhibited by the fact that his Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, was a staunch Radical Republican who supported Congressional Reconstruction in full. This further set Johnson against the Republican-controlled Congress, with Johnson wanting to remove Stanton from office and Congress wanting to keep him in place. Stanton and impeachment The Tenure of Office Act restricted the power of the President to suspend an officer while the Senate was not in session. (At that time, Congress sat during a relatively small portion of the year.) If, when the Senate reconvened, it declined to ratify the removal, the President would be required to reinstate the official.http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/impeach/imp_tenure.html In August 1867, with the Senate out of session, Johnson made his move against Stanton, suspending him pending the next session of the Senate. When the Senate convened on January 13, 1868, it refused, however, to ratify the removal by a vote of 35‚Äì6.Brenda Wineapple, The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation, pp. 234-235 (2019) Notwithstanding the vote, President Johnson appointed General Ulysses S. Grant the new Secretary of War because he wanted, by such action, to create a case through which to challenge the legitimacy of the Act before the Supreme Court. Proceedings began within days to move toward the impeachment of United States President Andrew Johnson, the first impeachment of a United States President. After a three-month trial, Johnson avoided removal from office by the Senate by a single vote. Stanton resigned in May 1868. It was very unclear whether Johnson had violated the Tenure of Office Act. The act's phrasing was murky, and it was not clear whether his removal of Stanton (a holdover from the Lincoln administration whom Johnson had not appointed) violated the Act. While the Act, by its terms, applied to current office holders, it also limited the protection offered to Cabinet members to one month after a new president took office. The Confederate Constitution was more explicit on the removal of executive offices of the federal government. It provided that ‚Äú[t]he principal officer in each of the Executive Departments [i.e. members of the President‚Äôs Cabinet], and all persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be removed from office at the pleasure of the President.‚ÄùConfederate Constitution, Art. II, ¬ß 2, cl. 3 All other civil officers of the Executive Department could be removed only ‚Äúwhen their services are unnecessary, or for dishonesty, incapacity, inefficiency, misconduct, or neglect of duty, and when so removed, the removal [was required to] be reported to the Senate, together with the reasons therefor.‚ÄùConfederate Constitution, Art. II, ¬ß 2, cl. 3 Given the disagreement over whether the Tenure of Office Act violated the United States Constitution, the proper course of action would have been not to impeach the President, but for Stanton to sue for wrongful termination and back pay, as happened in the subsequent case of Myers v. United States271 U.S. 52 (1926). Later use The act was amended on April 5, 1869, one month and one day after Republican President Ulysses S. Grant assumed the presidency. The revisions grew out of an attempt to completely repeal the 1867 act. The measure to repeal passed the House of Representatives with only 16 negative votes but failed in the Senate. The new provisions were significantly less onerous, allowing the President to suspend office holders \\"in his discretion\\" and designate replacements while the Senate was in recess, subject only to confirmation of the replacements at the next session. The President no longer had to report his reasons for suspension to the Senate, and the Senate could no longer force reinstatement of suspended office holders.Grover Cleveland. \\"The Independence of the Executive\\", lecture delivered at Princeton University, April 1900. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1913), pp. 30 et seq. Although Grant, in his first message to Congress, in December 1869, urged the repeal of even the revised act, it did not cause further problems until the election of Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884. Under the spoils system it had long been accepted practice for the administration of a new party to replace current office holders with party faithful. Cleveland, a supporter of a civil service system, had promised, however, to avoid wholesale replacements, vowing to replace incumbents only for cause. When he suspended several hundred office holders for cause, Senate committees requested information from cabinet members regarding the reasons for the suspensions, which Cleveland refused to provide. If he had simply said that the incumbents were being replaced for political reasons, the Senate would have complied, but Cleveland would not do so. When, in early 1886, the Senate as a whole demanded information regarding the conduct of the suspended U.S. Attorney for southern Alabama, Cleveland sent a message to Congress explaining his position opposing impingement of independence of the executive. Cleveland's replacement nominee was eventually confirmed when it was discovered that the suspended incumbent's term had expired in the meantime anyway. The Tenure of Office Act was finally repealed in 1887, 20 years after the law was enacted. Constitutionality In 1926, a similar law (though not dealing with Cabinet secretaries) was ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Myers v. United States, which affirmed the ability of the President to remove a Postmaster without Congressional approval. In reaching that decision, the Supreme Court stated in its majority opinion (though in dicta), \\"that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, insofar as it attempted to prevent the President from removing executive officers who had been appointed by him by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, was invalid\\".

The 1872 act was passed by the 42nd United States Congress and the original restrictive Act was passed by the United States Congress in May 1866.

The decision further contracted the nation's money supply and was seen by critics as an exacerbating factor of the so-called Long Depression, which struck in 1873. History Late in 1861, seeking to raise revenue for the American Civil War effort without exhausting its reserves of gold and silver, the United States federal government suspended specie payments, or the payments made in gold and silver in redemption of currency notes. Early in 1862, the United States issued legal-tender notes, called greenbacks. By war's end, a total of $431 million in greenbacks had been issued, and authorization had been given for another $50 million in small denominations, known as fractional currency or \\"shin plasters.\\" The issuance of greenbacks caused inflation during the period. Immediately after the Civil War during Reconstruction, there were large capital inflows into the United States and a general improvement in the export-to-import ratio since the export-dominant South was reintegrated with the North. The United States Treasury, however, had increased its cash balance through the summer of 1873 by selling gold for $14 million. National banks also increased issuance of national bank notes by $44 million. The failure of several railroad companies including Jay Cooke & Company on their bond obligations encouraged capital outflows from the United States to Europe and weakened demand for dollars leading to the Panic of 1873. Increased Treasury cash balances, continued issuance of national bank notes, and capital outflows together depreciated the currency. These factors further caused a reduction in reserves held by monetary institutions because higher prices increased domestic demand for currency. Reserves held by banks were insufficient to be able to meet seasonal demands in autumn of 1873 as greenback reserves declined from $34 million in September 1873 to $5 million in October 1873. Tensions surrounding the Panic of 1873 between creditors and debtors revived the specie payment resumption debate. Two views dominated this debate. Conservatives and the creditor class favored \\"hard money,\\" that is, they favored resumption as a method for making up losses incurred due to dollar depreciation during the past decade. The resumption of specie payments was perceived as a method to curb the rise in the price level and eventually equate currency with gold. For creditors that had issued debts in inflated greenbacks, resumption would increase the real interest rate that they received. Supporters of the Resumption Act argued that the Panic of 1873 might not have occurred had there been sufficient reserves of gold in the United States Treasury as would have been the case if specie payments were resumed. Opposed to resumption, a new coalition of agrarian and labor interests found common cause during Reconstruction in advocating for \\"soft money\\" or the promotion of inflationary monetary policies. These groups viewed the Panic of 1873 as the result of insufficient currency that should have been used to fuel the growth in production that occurred in the South and the West. These regions relied on cheap money ‚Äì that is low interest rates ‚Äì to be able to continue to grow. Other soft money advocates included gold speculators and the railroad industry. Collis P. Huntington and other railroad leaders called for further greenback issuance in light of harsh business conditions that made honoring debt obligations difficult. Opponents of the Resumption Act also argued that many debt obligations were made in an environment in which there existed a premium on gold, that is that inflation in the currency in the previous decade made gold relatively more valuable than currency. Resumption therefore entailed up to a 50% increase in debt obligation if gold and currency equalized. For manufacturers, the rising price of gold made domestic prices cheaper relative to import prices since many European currencies including the English sterling were fixed to the price of gold. Hence continued inflationary measures such as further issuance of greenbacks artificially supported domestic industries. Hard and soft money interests often did cross party lines, although a larger portion of Democrats were hard money advocates. Following a Democratic congressional victory in the elections of 1874, a lame- duck Republican congress passed The Resumption Act of January 14, 1875. It required the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem greenbacks in specie on demand on or after 1 January 1879. The Act, however, did not provide for a specific mechanism for redemption. The Act, though, did allow the Secretary of Treasury to acquire gold reserves either via any federal surpluses or the issuance of government bonds. An established gold reserve allowed for daily variations in specie flows and facilitated resumption. The act abolished the seigniorage fee on coining gold and substituted silver for any still existing fractional currency. The Resumption Act set no limit on the quantity of national bank notes that could be issued; this idea became known as \\"free banking.\\" This provision led many conservatives to believe that the Act was inflationary in nature. However, the Resumption Act also required that greenbacks be retired in a proportion of 80% of new national bank note issue, which in theory aimed to contract the money supply and hence encourage dollar appreciation such that gold and currency might equate. However, in practice the effect was mild: the total quantity of greenbacks in circulation fell from $382 million at the end of 1874 to $300 million following the passage of the Resumption Act. The Resumption Act was hotly debated during the 1880 presidential election, with most western politicians opposed to it. Specie payments finally resumed during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. Aided by the return of prosperity in 1877, Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman accumulated a gold reserve to be redeemed for existing greenbacks mostly from transactions with Europe. Sherman earmarked a redemption fund by January 1, 1879 that amounted to $133 million acquired from the sale of bonds to Europe and Treasury surplus. However, when people found greenbacks to be on par with gold, they lost their desire for redemption. Reaction and criticism Reactions as to the effects of the Resumption Act are mixed. Contemporaries did not consider it an outright victory for hard money. The legislation stood as a compromise engineered by Senators John Sherman and George Edmunds between hard and soft money advocates. Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz argue that the Resumption Act had mixed effects on actual resumption of specie payments, saying that primary economic product of the Act was that it instilled confidence in the business community on the maintenance of specie payments. The Act served as a signal to businesses of an approaching exchange rate between gold and currency. Preparations among businesses for this exchange rate actually encourage parity between gold and currency. The Act did not directly address the price level although successful resumption at par value required that the premium on gold to fall to zero, which in turn required a fall in the price level as the world price of gold was exogenous. In fact, the final date for Resumption was decided only after the premium on gold had fallen to a tenth of its peak level. The decline in the premium cannot entirely be attributed to the Resumption Act, as downward pressure on the overall price level also resulted from increased production in the South especially during 1877. The first four months of that year sold as much beef to England as had been sold all of the preceding year. The act has also been criticized for both failing to remove all greenbacks from circulation and failing to dictate what might be done with the greenbacks remaining in circulation.

Though the bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Congress overrode Hayes's veto on February 28, 1878 to enact the law.Ari Arthur Hoogenboom, Rutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President (1995) pp. 96‚Äì98 Background The five-year depression following the Panic of 1873 caused cheap-money advocates (led by Representative Richard P. Bland, a Democrat of Missouri), to join with silver-producing interests in urging a return to bimetallism, the use of both silver and gold as a standard.Irwin Unger, The Greenback Era: A Social and Political History of American Finance, 1865-1879 (1964) pp. 356‚Äì65 Coupled with Senator William B. Allison of Iowa, they agreed to a proposal that allowed silver to be purchased at market rates, metals to be minted into silver dollars, and required the US Treasury to purchase between $2 million to $4 million silver each month from western mines.Acts, Bills, and Laws, 1878.U.S. History. March 14th President Rutherford B. Hayes, who held interests in industrials and banking, vetoed the measure, which was overturned by Congress. As a result, the Hayes administration purchased the limited amount of silver each month. This act helped restore bimetallism with gold and silver both supporting the currency. However, gold remained heavily favored over silver, paving way for the gold standard. Free-silver movement U.S. Capitol. The free-silver movement of the late 19th century advocated the unlimited coinage of silver, which would have resulted in inflationary monetary policy. In 1873, Congress had removed the use of silver dollar from the list of authorized coins under the Coinage Act of 1873 (referred to by opponents as 'the Crime of '73'\\"). Although the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act of 1878 directed the Treasury to purchase silver from the \\"best-western\\" miners, President Grover Cleveland repealed the act in 1893.Our large change: The Denominations of the Currency. Quarterly Journal of Economics. 1918. Oxford University Press. JSTOR. March 14th 2011 Advocates of free silver included owners of silver mines in the West, farmers who believed an inclusion of silver would increase crop prices, and debtors who believed would alleviate their debts. Although the free silver movement ended, the debate of inflation and monetary policy continues to this day. Coinage Act of 1873 The Fourth Coinage Act acknowledged the gold standard over silver. Those who advocated for silver labeled this act as the Crime of '73. As a result of demonetized silver, gold became the only metallic standard in the United States and became the default standard. The price of gold was more stable than that of silver, largely due to silver discoveries in Nevada and other places in the West, and the price of silver to gold declined from 16-to-1 in 1873 to nearly 30-to-1 by 1893.Walton, Gary M. and Rockoff, Hugh, History of the American Economy (2010), p. 350. The term limping bimetallism describes this problem. The U.S. government finally ceded to pressure from the western mining states and the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act went into effect in 1878. The law was replaced in 1890 by the similar Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which in turn was repealed by Congress in 1893.Paul Studenski and Herman Edward Krooss, Financial History of the United States (2003) ‚Äì Page 216 These were two instances where the United States attempted to establish bimetallic standards in the long run. Reactions and economic impact Western miners and debtors regarded the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act as an insufficient measure to enforce unlimited coinage of silver, but opponents repealed the act and advocated for the gold standard. The effect of the Bland‚ÄìAllison act was also blunted by the minimal purchase of silver required by the Hayes administration. Although the act was a near turning point for bimetallism, gold continued to be favored over the bimetallism standard. Throughout 1860 to 1871, several attempts were made by the Treasury to establish the bimetallic standard by having gold and silver franc. However, the discovery of silver led to an influx of supply, lowering the price of silver. The eventual removal of the bimetallic standard, including the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act and the acceptance of the gold standard formed the monetary stability in the late 19th century. The limitation placed on the supply of new notes and the Treasury control over the issue of new notes allowed for economic stability. Prior to the acceptance, the devaluation of silver forced local governments into a financial turmoil. In addition, there was a need for money supply to increase as the credit system expanded and large banks established themselves across states.

Arthur on January 16, 1883. The act mandates that most positions within the federal government should be awarded on the basis of merit instead of political patronage. By the late 1870s, American politics operated on the spoils system, a political patronage practice in which officeholders awarded their allies with government jobs in return for financial and political support. Proponents of the spoils system were successful at blocking meaningful civil service reform until the assassination of President James A. Garfield in 1881. The 47th Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act during its lame duck session and President Chester A. Arthur, himself a former spoilsman, signed the bill into law. The Pendleton Civil Service Act provided for the selection of some government employees by competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote these government officials for political reasons and created the United States Civil Service Commission to enforce the merit system. The act initially only applied to about ten percent of federal employees, but it now covers most federal employees.  Background  Hayes kicking Chester A. Arthur out of the New York Custom House Since the presidency of Andrew Jackson, presidents had increasingly made political appointments on the basis of political support rather than on the basis of merit, in a practice known as the spoils system. In return for appointments, these appointees were charged with raising campaign funds and bolstering the popularity of the president and the party in their communities. The success of the spoils system helped ensure the dominance of both the Democratic Party in the period before the American Civil War and the Republican Party in the period after the Civil War. Patronage became a key issue in elections, as many partisans in both major parties were more concerned about control over political appointments than they were about policy issues. During the Civil War, Senator Charles Sumner introduced the first major civil service reform bill, calling for the use of competitive exams to determine political appointments. Sumner's bill failed to pass Congress, and in subsequent years several other civil service reform bills were defeated even as the public became increasingly concerned about public corruption. After taking office in 1877, President Rutherford B. Hayes established a special cabinet committee charged with drawing up new rules for federal appointments. Hayes's efforts for reform brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York. With Congress unwilling to take action on civil service reform, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. Hayes was forced to wait until July 1878 when, during a Congressional recess, he sacked Arthur and Cornell and replaced them with recess appointments. Despite opposition from Conkling, both of Hayes's nominees were confirmed by the Senate, giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory. For the remainder of his term, Hayes pressed Congress to enact permanent reform legislation and restore the dormant United States Civil Service Commission, even using his last annual message to Congress in 1880 to appeal for reform. Passage Ole Peter Hansen Balling's 1881 portrait of Chester A. Arthur In 1880, Democratic Senator George H. Pendleton of Ohio introduced legislation to require the selection of civil servants based on merit as determined by an examination, but the measure failed to pass. Pendleton's bill was largely based on reforms proposed by the Jay Commission, which Hayes had assigned to investigate the Port of New York. It also expanded similar civil service reforms attempted by President Franklin Pierce 30 years earlier. Hayes declined to seek a second term as president, and was succeeded by fellow Republican James A. Garfield, who won the 1880 presidential election on a ticket with former Port Collector Chester A. Arthur. In 1881, President Garfield was assassinated by Charles Guiteau, who believed that he had not received an appointment by Garfield because of his own affiliation with the Stalwarts. Garfield died on September 19, 1881, and was succeeded by Vice President Arthur. Many worried about how Arthur would act as president; the New York Times, which had supported Arthur earlier in his career, wrote \\"Arthur is about the last man who would be considered eligible for the position.\\" Garfield's assassination by a deranged office seeker amplified the public demand for reform. Civil service reformers established the National Civil Service Reform League and undertook a major public campaign for reform, arguing that the spoils system had played a major role in the assassination of Garfield. In President Arthur's first annual address to Congress, Arthur requested civil service reform legislation, and Pendleton again introduced his bill, which again did not pass. Democrats, campaigning on the reform issue, won control of the House of Representatives in the 1882 congressional elections. The party's disastrous performance in the 1882 elections helped convince many Republicans to support the civil service reform during the 1882 lame-duck session of Congress. The election results were seen as a public mandate for civil service reform, but many Republicans also wanted to pass a bill so that they could craft the legislation before losing control of Congress, allowing the party to take credit for the bill and to protect Republican officeholders from dismissal. The Senate approved Pendleton's bill, 38‚Äì5, and the House soon concurred by a vote of 155‚Äì47. Nearly all congressional opposition to the Pendleton bill came from Democrats, though a majority of Democrats in each chamber of Congress voted for the bill. Arthur signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act into law on January 16, 1883. Provisions The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act provided for selection of some government employees by competitive exams rather than ties to politicians, and made it illegal to fire or demote some government officials for political reasons. The act initially applied only to ten percent of federal jobs, but it allowed the president to expand the number of federal employees covered by the act. The law also created the United States Civil Service Commission to oversee civil service examinations and outlawed the use of \\"assessments,\\" fees that political appointees were expected to pay to their respective political parties as the price for their appointments. These assessments had made up a majority of political contributions in the era following Reconstruction. Aftermath To the surprise of his critics, Arthur acted quickly to appoint the members of the newly-created Civil Service Commission, naming reformers Dorman Bridgman Eaton, John Milton Gregory, and Leroy D. Thoman as commissioners. The commission issued its first rules in May 1883; by 1884, half of all postal officials and three-quarters of the Customs Service jobs were to be awarded by merit. During his first term, President Grover Cleveland expanded the number of federal positions subject to the merit system from 16,000 to 27,000. Partly due to Cleveland's efforts, between 1885 and 1897, the percentage of federal employees protected by the Pendleton Act would rise from twelve percent to approximately forty percent.Welch, 59‚Äì61 The act now covers about 90% of federal employees. Although state patronage systems and numerous federal positions were unaffected by the law, Karabell argues that the Pendleton Act was instrumental in the creation of a professional civil service and the rise of the modern bureaucratic state. The law also caused major changes in campaign finance, as the parties were forced to look for new sources of campaign funds, such as wealthy donors.

Known for campaigning for women's suffrage through legislative change, she led Britain's largest women's rights association, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) from 1897 to 1919. She wrote of herself: \\"I cannot say I became a suffragist. I always was one, from the time I was old enough to think at all about the principles of Representative Government.\\" Fawcett tried to improve women's chances of higher education, serving as a governor of Bedford College, London (now Royal Holloway), and co-founder of Newnham College, Cambridge in 1875. In 2018, 100 years after the passing of the Representation of the People Act, Fawcett became the first woman commemorated by a statue in Parliament Square. Biography 360x360px Early life Millicent Garrett Fawcett was born on 11 June 1847 in Aldeburgh, to Newson Garrett (1812‚Äì1893), a businessman from nearby Leiston, and his wife Louisa (n√©e Dunnell, 1813‚Äì1903) from London. She was the eighth of their ten children. According to the Stracheys, \\"The Garretts were a close and happy family in which children were encouraged to be physically active, read widely, speak their minds, and share in the political interests of their father, a convert from Conservatism to Gladstonian Liberalism, a combative man, and a keen patriot.\\" As a child, Fawcett's elder sister Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, who became Britain's first female doctor, introduced her to Emily Davies, an English suffragist. In her mother's biography, Louisa Garrett Anderson quoted Davies as saying to her mother, to Elizabeth and to Fawcett, \\"It is quite clear what has to be done. I must devote myself to securing higher education, while you open the medical profession to women. After these things are done, we must see about getting the vote.\\" She then turned to Millicent: \\"You are younger than we are, Millie, so you must attend to that.\\" In 1858, at the age of 12, Fawcett was sent to London with her sister Elizabeth to study at a private boarding school in Blackheath. Their sister Louise took Millicent to the sermons of Frederick Denison Maurice, a socially aware and less traditional Church of England minister, whose opinions influenced Millicent's view of religion. In 1865, she attended a lecture by John Stuart Mill and the following year, with friend Emily Davies, supported the Kensington Society by collecting signatures for a petition asking Parliament to enfranchise women householders. Marriage and family Millicent and Henry Fawcett John Stuart Mill introduced her to many other women's rights activists, including Henry Fawcett, a Liberal Member of Parliament who had intended to marry her sister Elizabeth before she decided to focus on her medical career. Millicent and Henry became close friends and married on 23 April 1867. Henry had been blinded in a shooting accident in 1858 and Millicent acted as his secretary. Their marriage was described as being based on \\"perfect intellectual sympathy\\", and Millicent pursued a writing career while caring for Henry. Fawcett ran two households, one in Cambridge and one in London. The family had some radical beliefs, supporting proportional representation, individualistic and free trade principles, and opportunities for women. Their only child, Philippa Fawcett, born in 1868, was strongly encouraged by her mother in her studies. In 1890 Philippa became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams.Series, Caroline. \\"And what became of the women?\\", Mathematical Spectrum, Vol. 30 (1997/8), 49‚Äì52. In 1868 Millicent joined the London Suffrage Committee, and in 1869 spoke at the first public pro-suffrage meeting held in London. In March 1870 she spoke in Brighton, her husband's constituency. As a speaker she was said to have a clear voice. In 1870 she published her short Political Economy for Beginners, which was \\"wildly successful\\", running through 10 editions in 41 years.See via Archive.org. In 1872 she and her husband published Essays and Lectures on Social and Political Subjects, which contained eight essays by Millicent.See via Archive.org. In 1875 she co-founded Newnham Hall and served on its council. Despite many interests and duties, Millicent, with Agnes Garrett, raised four of their cousins, who had been orphaned at an early age: Amy Garrett Badley, Fydell Edmund Garrett, Elsie Garrett (later a prominent botanical artist in South Africa), and Elsie's twin, John. After her husband died on 6 November 1884, Fawcett temporarily withdrew from public life, sold both family homes and moved with Philippa to the house of her sister, Agnes Garrett. When she resumed work in 1885, Fawcett began to concentrate on politics and was a key member of what became the Women's Local Government Society. Originally a Liberal, she joined the Liberal Unionist party in 1886 to oppose Irish Home Rule. She, like other English Protestants, felt that allowing a Catholic Ireland to have home rule would hurt England's prosperity and be disastrous for the Irish. In 1891 Fawcett wrote the introduction of a new edition of Mary Wollstonecraft's book A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Lyndall Gordon calls this an \\"influential essay\\", in which Fawcett reasserted the reputation of the early feminist philosopher and claimed her as a foremother of the struggle for the vote.Lyndall Gordon Vindication: A Life of Mary Wollstonecraft. Great Britain: Virago, 2005, p. 521 . Fawcett was granted an honorary doctorate of law by the University of St Andrews in 1899. Political activities Suffrage Alliance Congress with Fawcett presiding, London 1909. Top row from left: 324x324pxFawcett began her political career at the age of 22, at the first women's suffrage meeting. After the death of Lydia Becker, Fawcett became leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), Britain's main suffragist organisation. Politically she took a moderate position, distancing herself from the militancy and direct actions of the Women's Social and Political Union (WPSU), whose actions, she believed, harmed women's chances of winning the vote by souring public opinion and alienating Members of Parliament. Despite the publicity for the WSPU, the NUWSS with its slogan \\"Law-Abiding suffragists\\" retained more support. By 1905, Fawcett's NUWSS had 305 constituent societies and almost 50,000 members, compared with the WSPU's 2,000 members in 1913. Fawcett mainly fought for women's suffrage, and found home rule to be \\"a blow to the greatness and prosperity of England as well as disaster and... misery and pain and shame\\". She explains her disaffiliation from the more militant movement in her book What I remember: The South African War became an opportunity for Fawcett to share female responsibilities in British culture. She was nominated to lead the commission of women sent to South Africa. In July 1901, she sailed there with other women \\"to investigate Emily Hobhouse's indictment of atrocious conditions in concentration camps where the families of the Boer soldiers were interned.\\" No women in Britain had been entrusted before with such a task in wartime. Millicent fought for the civil rights of the Uitlanders, \\"as the cause of revival of interest in women's suffrage\\". Fawcett had backed countless campaigns over many years. A few of those she supported were to curb child abuse by raising the age of consent, criminalising incest, cruelty to children within the family, ending the practice of excluding women from courtrooms when sexual offences were considered, stamping out the \\"white slave trade\\", and preventing child marriage and the introduction of regulated prostitution in India. Fawcett campaigned to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, which reflected sexual double standards. They required prostitutes to be examined for sexually transmitted diseases and if they were found to have passed disease to their clients, to be imprisoned. Women could be arrested on suspicion of being a prostitute, and imprisoned for refusing consent to examinations that were invasive and painful. The men who infected the women were not subject to the Acts, which were repealed through campaigning by Fawcett and others. She believed such double moral standards would never be eradicated until women were represented in the public sphere.At front: Fawcett, 321x321px Fawcett wrote three books, one co-authored with her husband Henry, and many articles, some published posthumously. Fawcett's Political Economy for Beginners, went into ten editions, sparked two novels, and appeared in many languages. One of her first articles on women's education appeared in Macmillan's Magazine in 1875, the year when her interest in women's education led her to become a founder of Newnham College for Women in Cambridge. There she served on the college council and backed a controversial bid for all women to receive Cambridge degrees. Millicent regularly spoke at girls' schools, women's colleges and adult education centres. In 1904, she resigned from the Unionists over free trade, when Joseph Chamberlain gained control in his campaign for tariff reform. When the First World War broke out in 1914, the WSPU ceased all activities to focus on the war effort. Fawcett's NUWSS ceased political activity to support hospital services in training camps, Scotland, Russia and Serbia, largely because the organisation was significantly less militant than the WSPU: it contained many more pacifists and support for the war within the organisation was weaker. The WSPU was called jingoistic for its leaders' strong support for the war. While Fawcett was not a pacifist, she risked dividing the organisation if she ordered a halt to the campaign, and diverted NUWSS funds to the government as the WSPU had. The NUWSS continued to campaign for the vote during the war and used the situation to its advantage by pointing out the contribution women had made to the war effort. She held her post until 1919, a year after the first women had been granted the vote in the Representation of the People Act 1918. After that, she left the suffrage campaign and devoted much of her time to writing books, including a biography of Josephine Butler. Later years In 1919 Fawcett was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Birmingham. In the 1925 New Year Honours she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). She died in 1929 at her home in Gower Street, London. Her ashes were scattered at the Golders Green Crematorium. In 1932, a memorial to Fawcett, alongside that of her husband, was unveiled in Westminister Abbey with an inscription that reads: \\"A wise constant and courageous Englishwoman. She won citizenship for women.\\" Legacy Millicent Fawcett Hall was constructed in 1929 in Westminster as a place for women's debates and discussions; presently owned by Westminster School, the hall is used by the drama department as a 150-seat studio theatre. A blue plaque for Fawcett was erected in 1954 by London County Council at her home of 45 years in Bloomsbury. The archives of Millicent Fawcett are held at The Women's Library, London School of Economics. In February 2018 Fawcett was announced as the winner of the BBC Radio 4 poll for the most influential woman of the past 100 years. Commemoration In 2018, 100 years after the passing of the Representation of the People Act, for which Fawcett had successfully campaigned and which granted limited franchise, she became the first woman to be commemorated with a statue in Parliament Square, by the sculptor Gillian Wearing. This followed a campaign led by Caroline Criado Perez, in which over 84,000 online signatures were garnered. Statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square Fawcett's statue holds a banner quoting from a speech she gave in 1920, after Emily Davison's death during the 1913 Epsom Derby: \\"Courage calls to courage everywhere\\". At the unveiling of the statue Theresa May said: \\"I would not be standing here today as Prime Minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have the rights we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garret [sic] Fawcett.\\" Notable works *1870: Political Economy for Beginners Full text online *1872: Essays and Lectures on social and political subjects (with Henry Fawcett) Full text online. *1872: Electoral Disabilities of Women: a lecture *1874: Tales in Political Economy Full text online *1875: Janet Doncaster, a novel set in her birthplace of Aldeburgh, Suffolk *1889: Some Eminent Women of our Times: short biographical sketches Full text online *1895: Life of Her Majesty, Queen Victoria Full text online *1901: Life of the Right Hon.

Included in Harper's Weekly on 28 April 1877, p. 325. In politics and government, a spoils system (also known as a patronage system) is a practice in which a political party, after winning an election, gives government civil service jobs to its supporters, friends (cronyism), and relatives (nepotism) as a reward for working toward victory, and as an incentive to keep working for the party‚Äîas opposed to a merit system, where offices are awarded on the basis of some measure of merit, independent of political activity. The term was used particularly in politics of the United States, where the federal government operated on a spoils system until the Pendleton Act was passed in 1883 due to a civil service reform movement. Thereafter the spoils system was largely replaced by a nonpartisan merit at the federal level of the United States. The term was derived from the phrase \\"to the victor belong the spoils\\" by New York Senator William L. Marcy, referring to the victory of Andrew Jackson in the election of 1828, with the term spoils meaning goods or benefits taken from the loser in a competition, election or military victory.\\"spoils\\" dictionary definition Similar spoils systems are common in other nations that traditionally have been based on tribal organization or other kinship groups and localism in general. Origins Before 1828, moderation had prevailed in the transfer of political power from one U.S. president to another. Andrew Jackson's first inauguration, March 4, 1829, signaled a sharp departure from the past. A group of office seekers attended the event, explaining it as democratic enthusiasm. Jackson supporters had been lavished with promises of positions in return for political support. These promises were honored by a large number of removals after Jackson assumed power. At the beginning of Jackson's administration, fully 919 officials were removed from government positions, amounting to nearly 10 percent of all government postings. The Jackson administration aimed at creating a more efficient system where the chain of command of public employees all obeyed the higher entities of government. The hardest changed organization within the federal government proved to be the post office. The post office was the largest department in the federal government, and had even more personnel than the war department. In one year 423 postmasters were deprived of their positions, most with extensive records of good service. Reform By the late 1860s, citizens began demanding civil service reform. Running under the Liberal Republican Party in 1872, they were soundly defeated by Ulysses S. Grant. After the assassination of James A. Garfield by a rejected office-seeker in 1881, the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level came with the passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job. The Pendleton Act's reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the White House every election between 1884 and 1896. After each election the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to jobs held by his political supporters. By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service and the spoils system was limited only to very senior positions. The separation between the political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the Hatch Act of 1939 which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities. The spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the Tammany Hall machine, which survived well into the 1930s when New York City reformed its own civil service. Illinois modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under Frank Lowden, but Chicago held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the Shakman Decrees of 1972 and 1983. Modern variations on the spoils system are often described as the political machine.

Arthur on May 6, 1882, prohibiting all immigration of Chinese laborers. Building on the 1875 Page Act, which banned Chinese women from immigrating to the United States, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first, and remains the only law to have been implemented, to prevent all members of a specific ethnic or national group from immigrating to the United States. The act followed the Angell Treaty of 1880, a set of revisions to the U.S.‚ÄìChina Burlingame Treaty of 1868 that allowed the U.S. to suspend Chinese immigration. The act was initially intended to last for 10 years, but was renewed and strengthened in 1892 with the Geary Act and made permanent in 1902. These laws attempted to stop all Chinese immigration into the United States for ten years, with exceptions for diplomats, teachers, students, merchants, and travelers. The laws were widely evaded.Erika Lee, At America's Gates: Chinese Immigration During the Exclusion Era, 1882‚Äì1943 (U of North Carolina Press, 2003. Exclusion was repealed by the Magnuson Act on December 17, 1943, which allowed 105 Chinese to enter per year. Chinese immigration later increased with the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which abolished direct racial barriers, and later by Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which abolished the National Origins Formula. Background This \\"Official Map of Chinatown 1885\\" was published as part of an official report of a Special Committee established by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors \\"on the Condition of the Chinese Quarter\\". Chinese immigrant workers building the Transcontinental Railroad The first significant Chinese immigration to North America began with the California Gold Rush of 1848‚Äì1855 and it continued with subsequent large labor projects, such as the building of the First Transcontinental Railroad. During the early stages of the gold rush, when surface gold was plentiful, the Chinese were tolerated by white people, if not well received. However, as gold became harder to find and competition increased, animosity toward the Chinese and other foreigners increased. After being forcibly driven from mining by a mixture of state legislators and other miners (the Foreign Miner's Tax), the immigrant Chinese began to settle in enclaves in cities, mainly San Francisco, and took up low-wage labor, such as restaurant and laundry work. With the post-Civil War economy in decline by the 1870s, anti-Chinese animosity became politicized by labor leader Denis Kearney and his Workingman's Party as well as by California governor John Bigler, both of whom blamed Chinese \\"coolies\\" for depressed wage levels. Public opinion and law in California began to demonize Chinese workers and immigrants in any role, with the later half of the 1800s seeing a series of ever more restrictive laws being placed on Chinese labor, behavior and even living conditions. While many of these legislative efforts were quickly overturned by the State Supreme Court, many more anti-Chinese laws continued to be passed in both California and nationally. In the early 1850s there was resistance to the idea of excluding Chinese migrant workers from immigration because they provided essential tax revenue which helped fill the fiscal gap of California. The Chinese emperor at the time was supportive of the exclusion, citing his concerns that Chinese immigration to America would lead to a loss of labor for China. But toward the end of the decade, the financial situation improved and subsequently, attempts to legislate Chinese exclusion became successful on the state level. In 1858, the California Legislature passed a law that made it illegal for any person \\"of the Chinese or Mongolian races\\" to enter the state; however, this law was struck down by an unpublished opinion of the State Supreme Court in 1862. The Chinese immigrant workers provided cheap labor and did not use any of the government infrastructure (schools, hospitals, etc.) because the Chinese migrant population was predominantly made up of healthy male adults. As time passed and more and more Chinese migrants arrived in California, violence would often break out in cities such as Los Angeles. A strike which was broken by the replacement of all workers with over 200 Chinese men at the Beaver Falls Cutlery Company in Pennsylvania was mentioned at the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Congress. \\"In some measure it contributed to the eventual passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act.\\" At one point, Chinese men represented nearly a quarter of all wage-earning workers in California, and by 1878 Congress felt compelled to try to ban immigration from China in legislation that was later vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The title of the August 27, 1873 San Francisco Chronicle article, \\"The Chinese Invasion! They Are Coming, 900,000 Strong\\", was traced by The Atlantic as one of the roots of the 2019 anti-immigration \\"invasion\\" rhetoric. In 1879 however, California adopted a new Constitution, which explicitly authorized the state government to determine which individuals were allowed to reside in the state, and banned the Chinese from employment by corporations and state, county or municipal governments. Although debate exists over whether or not the anti-Chinese animus in California drove the federal government (the California Thesis), or whether or not Chinese racism was simply inherent in the country at that point, by 1882, the federal government was finally convinced to pass the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned all immigration from China for a period of 10 years. Anti-Chinese Wall cartoon in Puck After the act was passed, most Chinese workers were faced with a dilemma: stay in the United States alone or go back to China to reunite with their families. Although widespread dislike for the Chinese persisted well after the law itself was passed, of note is that some capitalists and entrepreneurs resisted their exclusion because they accepted lower wages. Content For the first time, federal law proscribed entry of an ethnic working group on the premise that it endangered the good order of certain localities. (The earlier Page Act of 1875 had prohibited immigration of Asian forced laborers and sex workers, and the Naturalization Act of 1790 prohibited naturalization of non-white subjects.) The act excluded Chinese laborers, meaning \\"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining,\\" from entering the country for ten years under penalty of imprisonment and deportation. Front page of The San Francisco Call from November 20th 1901, discussing the Chinese Exclusion Convention The Chinese Exclusion Act required the few non laborers who sought entry to obtain certification from the Chinese government that they were qualified to emigrate. However, this group found it increasingly difficult to prove that they were not laborers because the 1882 act defined excludables as \\"skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining.\\" Thus very few Chinese could enter the country under the 1882 law. Diplomatic officials and other officers on business, along with their house servants, for the Chinese government were also allowed entry as long as they had the proper certification verifying their credentials. The act also affected the Chinese who had already settled in the United States. Any Chinese who left the United States had to obtain certifications for reentry, and the Act made Chinese immigrants permanent aliens by excluding them from U.S. citizenship. After the act's passage, Chinese men in the U.S. had little chance of ever reuniting with their wives, or of starting families in their new abodes. Amendments made in 1884 tightened the provisions that allowed previous immigrants to leave and return, and clarified that the law applied to ethnic Chinese regardless of their country of origin. The Scott Act (1888) expanded upon the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting reentry into the U.S. after leaving. Constitutionality of the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Scott Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in Chae Chan Ping v. United States (1889); the Supreme Court declared that \\"the power of exclusion of foreigners [is] an incident of sovereignty belonging to the government of the United States as a part of those sovereign powers delegated by the constitution.\\" The act was renewed for ten years by the 1892 Geary Act, and again with no terminal date in 1902. When the act was extended in 1902, it required \\"each Chinese resident to register and obtain a certificate of residence. Without a certificate, he or she faced deportation.\\" Between 1882 and 1905, about 10,000 Chinese appealed against negative immigration decisions to federal court, usually via a petition for habeas corpus. In most of these cases, the courts ruled in favor of the petitioner. Except in cases of bias or negligence, these petitions were barred by an act that passed Congress in 1894 and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. vs Lem Moon Sing (1895). In U.S. vs Ju Toy (1905), the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed that the port inspectors and the Secretary of Commerce had final authority on who could be admitted. Ju Toy's petition was thus barred despite the fact that the district court found that he was an American citizen. The Supreme Court determined that refusing entry at a port does not require due process and is legally equivalent to refusing entry at a land crossing. All these developments, along with the extension of the act in 1902, triggered a boycott of U.S. goods in China between 1904 and 1906. There was one 1885 case in San Francisco, however, in which Treasury Department officials in Washington overturned a decision to deny entry to two Chinese students. One of the critics of the Chinese Exclusion Act was the anti- slavery/anti-imperialist Republican senator George Frisbie Hoar of Massachusetts who described the act as \\"nothing less than the legalization of racial discrimination.\\" It was primarily meant to retain white superiority especially with regards to working privileges. Congressman Rufus Dawes who voted against the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act was not reelected to Congress. The laws were driven largely by racial concerns; immigration of persons of other races was unlimited during this period. On the other hand, most people and unions strongly supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, including the American Federation of Labor and Knights of Labor, a labor union, who supported it because it believed that industrialists were using Chinese workers as a wedge to keep wages low. Among labor and leftist organizations, the Industrial Workers of the World were the sole exception to this pattern. The IWW openly opposed the Chinese Exclusion Act from its inception in 1905. A political cartoon from 1882, showing a Chinese man being barred entry to the \\"Golden Gate of Liberty\\". The caption reads, \\"We must draw the line somewhere, you know.\\" 180px For all practical purposes, the Exclusion Act, along with the restrictions that followed it, froze the Chinese community in place in 1882. Limited immigration from China continued until the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943. From 1910 to 1940, the Angel Island Immigration Station on what is now Angel Island State Park in San Francisco Bay served as the processing center for most of the 56,113 Chinese immigrants who are recorded as immigrating or returning from China; upwards of 30% more who showed up were returned to China. Angel Island State Park was where the Chinese immigrants were accepted to stay in the United States or made to leave. Furthermore, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which destroyed City Hall and the Hall of Records, many immigrants (known as \\"paper sons\\") claimed that they had familial ties to resident Chinese-American citizens. Whether these were true or not cannot be proven. The Chinese Exclusion Act also led to an expansion of the power of U.S. immigration law through its influence on Canada's policies on Chinese exclusion during this time because of the need for greater vigilance at the U.S.-Canada border. Shortly after the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act, Canada established the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 which imposed a head tax on Chinese migrants entering Canada. After increasing pressure from the U.S. government, Canada finally established the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923 which banned most forms of immigration by the Chinese to Canada. There was also a need for this kind of border control along the U.S‚ÄìMexico border, however, efforts to control the border went along a different path because Mexico was fearful of expanding imperial power of the U.S. and did not want U.S. interference in Mexico. Not only this, but Chinese immigration to Mexico was welcomed because the Chinese immigrants filled Mexico's labor needs. The Chinese Exclusion Act actually led to heightened Chinese immigration to Mexico because of exclusion by the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. resorted to heavily policing the border along Mexico. Later, the Immigration Act of 1924 restricted immigration even further, excluding all classes of Chinese immigrants and extending restrictions to other Asian immigrant groups. Until these restrictions were relaxed in the middle of the twentieth century, Chinese immigrants were forced to live a life separated from their families, and to build ethnic enclaves in which they could survive on their own (Chinatown). The Chinese Exclusion Act did not address the problems that whites were facing; in fact, the Chinese were quickly and eagerly replaced by the Japanese, who assumed the role of the Chinese in society. Unlike the Chinese, some Japanese were even able to climb the rungs of society by setting up businesses or becoming truck farmers. However, the Japanese were later targeted in the National Origins Act of 1924, which banned immigration from east Asia entirely. In 1891, the Government of China refused to accept U.S. senator Henry W. Blair as U.S. minister to China due to his abusive remarks regarding China during negotiation of the Chinese Exclusion Act. The American Christian George F. Pentecost spoke out against western imperialism in China, saying: I personally feel convinced that it would be a good thing for America if the embargo on Chinese immigration were removed. I think that the annual admission of 100,000 into this country would be a good thing for the country. And if the same thing were done in the Philippines those islands would be a veritable Garden of Eden in twenty-five years. The presence of Chinese workmen in this country would, in my opinion, do a very great deal toward solving our labor problems. There is no comparison between the Chinaman, even of the lowest coolie class, and the man who comes here from Southeastern Europe, from Russia, or from Southern Italy. The Chinese are thoroughly good workers. That is why the laborers here hate them. I think, too, that the emigration to America would help the Chinese. At least he would come into contact with some real Christian people in America. The Chinaman lives in squalor because he is poor. If he had some prosperity his squalor would cease.  The \\"Driving Out\\" period  Following the passing of the Chinese Exclusion Act, a period known as the \\"Driving Out\\" era was born. In this period, anti-Chinese Americans physically forced Chinese communities to flee to other areas. Large scale violence in Western states included The Rock Springs Chinese Massacre (1885) and the Hells Canyon Massacre of 1887.  Rock Springs massacre of 1885  The massacre was named for the town where it took place, Rock Springs, Wyoming in Sweetwater County, where white miners were jealous of the Chinese for their employment. White miners expressed their jealous frustration by robbing, shooting, and stabbing the Chinese in Chinatown. The Chinese tried to flee but many were burned alive in their homes, starved to death in hidden refuge, or exposed to animal predators in the mountains. Some were rescued by a passing train, but by the end of the event at least twenty-eight lives had been taken. In an attempt to appease the situation, the government intervened by sending federal troops to protect the Chinese. However, only compensations for destroyed property were paid. No-one was arrested nor held accountable for the atrocities committed during the riot.  Hells Canyon massacre of 1887  The massacre was named for the location where it took place, along the Snake River in Hells Canyon near the mouth of Deep Creek. The area contained many rocky cliffs and white rapids that together posed significant danger to human safety. Thirty-four Chinese miners were killed at the site. The miners were employed by Sam Yup company, one of the six largest Chinese companies at the time, worked in this area since October 1886. An accurate account of the event is still unclear to this day due to unreliable law enforcement at the time, biased news reporting, and lack of serious official investigations. However, it is speculated that the dead Chinese miners were not victims of natural causes, but rather victims of gun shot wounds during a robbery committed by a gang of seven armed horse thieves. An amount of gold worth $4,000‚Äì$5,000 was estimated to have been stolen from the miners. The whereabouts of the gold were never recovered nor further investigated. Recently, attempts to formulate an accurate picture of the event were drawn from hidden copies of trial documents that contained grand jury indictment, depositions given by the accused, notes from the trial, and historical accounts of Wallowa County by J. Harland Horner and H. Ross Findley. = Horner and Findley accounts = Horner and Findley were both schoolboys at the time of the massacre but their accounts had glaring discrepancies. Findley believed the massacre was a planned event with more than just a motive to steal gold from the Chinese miners. He believed the arrested culprits wanted to eliminate the Chinese miners from the area as well, which they successfully accomplished. In contrast to most accounts, Findley only recalled 31 confirmed victims, and there was no mention of a trial. On the other hand, Horner believed that the event was a spur of the moment event and affected 34 confirmed victims. The school boys initially only had intentions to steal horses, but experienced difficulty crossing the river with the stolen horses. When the Chinese miners refused to loan their boats, the boys decided to take the boats by force. = The bodies = Other disagreements on the motives could also be attributed to the fact that the bodies of the Chinese miners were only found downstream after two weeks. It is unclear if the mangled bodies found were due to human manslaughter or the aftermath of being thrown into turbulent waters. The rapids and brute force of the current could have mangled the bodies against the rocks. However, it is confirmed that the Chinese men were shot because of the gunshot wounds found on the bodies. Only ten bodies were identified on February 16, 1888: Chea-po, Chea-Sun, Chea-Yow, Chea-Shun, Chea Cheong, Chea Ling, Chea Chow, Chea Lin Chung, Kong Mun Kow, and Kong Ngan. Little is known about these identified men. = The aftermath = Shortly following the incident, the Sam Yup company of San Francisco hired Lee Loi who later hired Joseph K. Vincent, then U.S. Commissioner, to lead an investigation. Vincent submitted his investigative report to the Chinese consulate who tried unsuccessfully to obtain justice for the Chinese miners. At around the same time, other compensation reports were also unsuccessfully filed for earlier crimes inflicted on the Chinese. In the end, on October 19, 1888, Congress agreed to greatly under-compensate for the massacre and ignore the claims for the earlier crimes. Even though the amount was greatly underpaid, it was still a small victory to the Chinese who had low expectations for relief or acknowledgement. = Current updates = The US Board on Geographic Names officially named the Deep Creek massacre site to the Chinese Massacre Cove. This served as the first ever official recognition of the crime. Additionally in June 2012, a memorial was established (with private funds and donations) for the Chinese miners who were murdered.  Issues of the act  The Chinese Exclusion Act brought rigidity not only to the Chinese alone but to Caucasians and other races as well which lasted for about thirty years. The American economy suffered a great loss as a result of this act. Some sources cite the act as a sign of injustice and unfair treatment to the Chinese workers because the jobs they engaged in were mostly menial jobs.  Bubonic plague in Chinatown  In 1900‚Äì1904 San Francisco suffered from the bubonic plague. It first struck San Francisco's Chinatown, causing people to fall ill and experience fevers, swollen lymph nodes, muscle aches and fatigue. Left untreated this infection can cause complications such as gangrene, meningitis, and even death. The bubonic plague outbreak in San Francisco's Chinatown strengthened anti-Chinese sentiment in all of California despite scientific research at the time showing it was caused by Yersinia pestis, which was spread by fleas, found in small rodents. When the first round of people died from this plague, the companies and the state denied the fact that there was an outbreak, in order to keep San Francisco's reputation and businesses in order. Unsanitary conditions and population density caused outbreaks such as this one to spread quickly, and therefore affected a large number of people in this community. The first deaths from the plague in San Francisco were in 1898; a French barque carried some passengers who had died of the plague. After its arrival in San Francisco, 18 more Chinatown residents died of the same symptoms. The mayor decided not to release a public warning of the outbreak, thinking it would negatively affect San Francisco's commercial business. Chinatown was quarantined, and sanitary services were suspended for some time until presence of bacteriological source was found. A sanitary campaign was launched; however many residents chose to avoid anything and everything that had to do with the plague out of fear and humiliation. As more and more deaths occurred, the city began being more aggressive, and they started checking nearly everyone in Chinatown for any signs of disease. Therefore, the Chinese community began to distrust the government even more. Racism toward Chinese immigrants was socially accepted and social rights were oftentimes denied to this community. This fact made it harder for the community of Chinatown to seek medical attention for their illnesses during the plague. Repeal and current status The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed by the 1943 Magnuson Act, during a time when China had become an ally of the U.S. against Japan in World War II as the US needed to embody an image of fairness and justice. The Magnuson Act permitted Chinese nationals already residing in the country to become naturalized citizens and stop hiding from the threat of deportation. While the Magnuson Act overturned the discriminatory Chinese Exclusion Act, it only allowed a national quota of 105 Chinese immigrants per year, and did not repeal the restrictions on immigration from the other Asian countries. Large scale Chinese immigration did not occur until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. The crackdown on Chinese immigrants reached a new level in its last decade, from 1956‚Äì1965, with the Chinese Confession Program launched by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, that encouraged Chinese who had committed immigration fraud to confess, so as to be eligible for some leniency in treatment. Despite the fact that the exclusion act was repealed in 1943, the law in California prohibiting non-whites from marrying whites was not struck down until 1948, in which the California Supreme Court ruled the ban of interracial marriage within the state unconstitutional in Perez v. Sharp.See Perez v. Sharp, 32 Cal. 2d 711 (1948). Some other states had such laws until 1967, when the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Loving v. Virginia that anti-miscegenation laws across the nation are unconstitutional. Even today, although all its constituent sections have long been repealed, Chapter 7 of Title 8 of the United States Code is headed \\"Exclusion of Chinese\\". It is the only chapter of the 15 chapters in Title 8 (Aliens and Nationality) that is completely focused on a specific nationality or ethnic group. Like the following Chapter 8, \\"The Cooly Trade\\", it consists entirely of statutes that are noted as \\"Repealed\\" or \\"Omitted\\". On June 18, 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed , a resolution which had been introduced by Congresswoman Judy Chu, that formally expresses the regret of the House of Representatives for the Chinese Exclusion Act, an act which imposed almost total restrictions on Chinese immigration and naturalization and denied Chinese-Americans basic freedoms because of their ethnicity. , a similar resolution, had been approved by the U.S. Senate in October 2011.\\"US apologizes for Chinese Exclusion Act\\". China Daily, 19 June 2012 In 2014, the California Legislature took formal action to pass measures that formally recognize the many proud accomplishments of Chinese-Americans in California and to call upon Congress to formally apologize for the 1882 adoption of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Senate Republican leader Bob Huff (R-Diamond Bar) and incoming Senate president pro-Tem Kevin de Le√≥n (D-Los Angeles) served as joint authors for Senate Joint Resolution (SJR) 23 Direct URL and Senate Concurrent Resolution (SCR) 122, Direct URL respectively. Both SJR 23 and SCR 122 acknowledge and celebrate the history and contributions of Chinese Americans in California. The resolutions also formally call on Congress to apologize for laws which resulted in the persecution of Chinese Americans, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act. Perhaps most important is the sociological implications for understanding ethnic/race relations in the context of American history: there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis‚Äîwhether perceived or real‚Äîpatterns of retractability of American identities have erupted to the forefront of America's political landscape, often generating institutional and civil society backlash against workers from other nations, a pattern documented by Fong's research into how crises drastically alter social relationships.

Originally signed in 1929 in Warsaw (hence the name), it was amended in 1955 at The Hague, Netherlands, and in 1971 in Guatemala City, Guatemala. United States courts have held that, at least for some purposes, the Warsaw Convention is a different instrument from the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol. History On 17 August 1923, the French government proposed the convening of a diplomatic conference in November 1923 for the purpose of concluding a convention relating to liability in international carriage by air. The conference was formally deferred on two occasions due to reluctant behavior of the governments of various nations to act on such a short notice without the knowledge of the proposed convention. Finally, between 27 October and 6 November, the first conference met in Paris to study the draft convention. Since most of the participants were diplomats accredited to the French government and not professionals, it was agreed unanimously that a body of technical, legal experts be set up to study the draft convention prior to its submission to the diplomatic conference for approval. Accordingly, the International Technical Committee of Legal Experts on Air Questions (Comit√© International Technique d‚ÄôExperts Juridiques A√©riens, CITEJA) was formed in 1925. In 1927‚Äì28 CITEJA studied and developed the proposed draft convention and developed it into the present package of unification of law and presented it at the Warsaw Conference, where it was approved between 4 and 12 October 1929. It unified an important sector of private air law. The Convention was written originally in French and the original documents were deposited in the archives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Poland. After coming into force on 13 February 1933, it resolved some conflicts of law and jurisdiction. Between 1948‚Äì51 it was further studied by a legal committee set up by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and in 1952 a new draft was prepared to replace the convention. However it was rejected and it was decided that the convention be amended rather than replaced in 1953. The work done by the legal committee at the Ninth Session was presented to the International Conference on Air Law which was convened by the Council of the ICAO and met at The Hague from 6 to 28 September 1955. The Hague Conference adopted a Protocol (the Hague Protocol) for the amendment of the Warsaw Convention. Between the parties of the Protocol, it was agreed that the 1929 Warsaw Convention and the 1955 Hague Protocol were to be read and interpreted together as one single instrument to be known as the Warsaw Convention as amended at the Hague in 1955. This was not an amendment to the convention but rather a creation of a new and separate legal instrument that is only binding between the parties. If one nation is a party to the Warsaw Convention and another to the Hague Protocol, neither state has an instrument in common and therefore there is no mutual international ground for litigation. The Montreal Convention, signed in 1999, replaced the Warsaw Convention system. Content There are five chapters: *Chapter I ‚Äì Definitions *Chapter II ‚Äì Documents of Carriage; Luggage and Passenger Ticket *Chapter III ‚Äì Liability of the Carrier *Chapter IV ‚Äì Provisions Relating to Combined Carriage *Chapter V ‚Äì General and Final Provisions In the convention there is a provision of successive carriage and a combined carriage partly by air and partly by other modes of transport as well. In particular, the Warsaw Convention: *Defines \\"international carriage\\" and the convention's scope of applicability *Sets rules for documents of carriage *Sets rules for the air carrier's liability and limitations thereof *Sets rules for legal jurisdiction *Mandates carriers to issue passenger tickets; *Requires carriers to issue baggage checks for checked luggage; *Creates a limitation period of two years within which a claim must be brought (Article 29); and *Limits a carrier's liability to at most:  250,000 Francs or 16,600 special drawing rights (SDR) for personal injury;  250 Francs or 19 SDR per kilogram for checked luggage and cargo, or US$20 per kilogram for non-signatories of the amended Montreal Convention;  5,000 Francs or 332 SDR for the hand luggage of a traveller. The sums limiting liability were originally given in gold francs (defined in terms of a particular quantity of gold by article 22 paragraph 5 of the convention). These sums were amended by the Montreal Additional Protocol No. 2 to substitute an expression given in terms of SDRs. These sums are valid in the absence of a differing agreement (on a higher sum) with the carrier. Agreements on lower sums are null and void. A court may also award a claiming party's costs, unless the carrier made an offer within 6 months of the loss (or at least 6 months before the beginning of any legal proceedings) which the claiming party has failed to beat. The Warsaw Convention provides that a plaintiff can file a lawsuit at his or her discretion in one of the following forums: # The carrier's principal place of business # The domicile of the carrier # The carrier's place of business through which the contract was made # The place of the destination According to Clauses 17 and 18 of the Warsaw Convention, airline companies are liable for any damage that occurs to passengers or their belongings during in-flight. However, airline companies will not be held responsible if the damage results from the passenger's own fault or one of their temporary servants such as doctors assisting ill passengers on their own initiative (Clause 20). To be covered by air carriers, doctors should respond to the captain's call when it comes to assisting ill passengers. In such cases, doctors are considered an airline's temporary servants who acted on the airline's instructions.Laur, A. (2013). Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft. Medico-Legal Journal, 81(1), 31‚Äì35. Major airlines are all covered by insurance to meet such contingencies and to cover doctors who act as their temporary agents. Ratifications As of 2015, the Warsaw Convention had been ratified by 152 states. The Protocol to the Convention had been ratified by 137 states.
