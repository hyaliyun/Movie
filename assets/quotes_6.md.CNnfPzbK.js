Motivation The theory of holomorphic (=analytic) functions of one complex variable is one of the most beautiful and most useful parts of the whole mathematics. One drawback of this theory is that it deals only with maps between two-dimensional spaces (Riemann surfaces). The theory of functions of several complex variables has a different character, mainly because analytic functions of several variables are not conformal. Conformal maps can be defined between Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimension, but when the dimension is greater than 2, this class of maps is very small: it consists of Möbius transformations only. This is a theorem of Joseph Liouville; relaxing the smoothness assumptions does not help, as proved by Yurii Reshetnyak. This suggests the search of a generalization of the property of conformality which would give a rich and interesting class of maps in higher dimension. Definition A differentiable map f of a region D in Rn to Rn is called K-quasiregular if the following inequality holds at all points in D: : \\\\ Df(x)\\\\^n\\\\leq KJ_f(x) . Here K ≥ 1 is a constant, Jf is the Jacobian determinant, Df is the derivative, that is the linear map defined by the Jacobi matrix, and · is the usual (Euclidean) norm of the matrix. The development of the theory of such maps showed that it is unreasonable to restrict oneself to differentiable maps in the classical sense, and that the \\"correct\\" class of maps consists of continuous maps in the Sobolev space W whose partial derivatives in the sense of distributions have locally summable n-th power, and such that the above inequality is satisfied almost everywhere. This is a formal definition of a K-quasiregular map. A map is called quasiregular if it is K-quasiregular with some K. Constant maps are excluded from the class of quasiregular maps. Properties The fundamental theorem about quasiregular maps was proved by Reshetnyak: :Quasiregular maps are open and discrete. This means that the images of open sets are open and that preimages of points consist of isolated points. In dimension 2, these two properties give a topological characterization of the class of non-constant analytic functions: every continuous open and discrete map of a plane domain to the plane can be pre-composed with a homeomorphism, so that the result is an analytic function. This is a theorem of Simion Stoilov. Reshetnyak's theorem implies that all pure topological results about analytic functions (such that the Maximum Modulus Principle, Rouché's theorem etc.) extend to quasiregular maps. Injective quasiregular maps are called quasiconformal. A simple example of non-injective quasiregular map is given in cylindrical coordinates in 3-space by the formula : (r,\\\\theta,z)\\\\mapsto (r,2\\\\theta,z). This map is 2-quasiregular. It is smooth everywhere except the z-axis. A remarkable fact is that all smooth quasiregular maps are local homeomorphisms. Even more remarkable is that every quasiregular local homeomorphism Rn → Rn, where n ≥ 3, is a homeomorphism (this is a theorem of Vladimir Zorich). This explains why in the definition of quasiregular maps it is not reasonable to restrict oneself to smooth maps: all smooth quasiregular maps of Rn to itself are quasiconformal. Rickman's theorem Many theorems about geometric properties of holomorphic functions of one complex variable have been extended to quasiregular maps. These extensions are usually highly non-trivial. Perhaps the most famous result of this sort is the extension of Picard's theorem which is due to Seppo Rickman: :A K-quasiregular map Rn -> Rn can omit at most a finite set. When n = 2, this omitted set can contain at most two points (this is a simple extension of Picard's theorem). But when n > 2, the omitted set can contain more than two points, and its cardinality can be estimated from above in terms of n and K. In fact, any finite set can be omitted, as shown by David Drasin and Pekka Pankka. Connection with potential theory If f is an analytic function, then log f is subharmonic, and harmonic away from the zeros of f. The corresponding fact for quasiregular maps is that log f satisfies a certain non-linear partial differential equation of elliptic type. This discovery of Reshetnyak stimulated the development of non-linear potential theory, which treats this kind of equations as the usual potential theory treats harmonic and subharmonic functions.

The episode is set ten years after the John Grisham's 1991 novel and its 1993 film adaptation. It aired on January 8, 2012, as a two-hour series premiere. According to The Hollywood Reporter Tim Goodman, the pilot establishes several character traits: Lucas immediately delivers the impression that he is a good actor, who is both conventionally attractive and believable. Abby McDeere (Molly Parker) is a dutiful wife, but she has concerns about the finances of Mitch’s upstart solo firm. Claire McDeere (Natasha Calis), Mitch’s daughter, regrets the turmoil of a life on the run. Ray McDeere (Callum Keith Rennie) has a serious police record and serves Mitch as a private investigator. Tammy (Juliette Lewis), the office assistant and Ray's girlfriend, is a smoker, a nag and a provocative dresser. The Pilot episode received mediocre reviews.  Plot  The episode opens with a bleached-out opening sequence of a chase scene of Mitch McDeere (Josh Lucas) being chased in Washington, DC by three men in suits. It uses flashbacks to help the viewer get up to speed on Mitch's history, including some pedestrian legal cases. Following the chase, he makes his escape by jumping into the bed of a pickup truck. At one point in the chase scene, Mitch is able to call his wife on a payphone to give her the danger signal: \\"It’s happening again.\\" Once he tells her that they have to go back to being on the run, the story flashes back to the recent past when the family emerged from witness protection. The flashback takes us six weeks prior and is presented in normal lighting. Among the essential facts quickly conveyed is that Mitchell McDeere was the whistle- blower who brought down a law firm that was a mob front without breaking the law or betraying his gangster clients. Yet, the mob kingpin responded to his own arrest by arranging a hit on McDeere, compelling his family to participate in the witness protection program until his death. They left the program because the witness protection program had them on the run for too long. Mitch demonstrates his willingness and determination to solve problems for pro bono customers despite his dire financial situation when he is dealt the case of a high-school kid accused of murdering a classmate. Mitch was compelled by a benevolent judge to play the defense lawyer in a schoolyard killing. His idealism leads him to uphold his oath and ignore his client's innocence or guilt as well as his truthfulness. Once his client is released to his father's custody until the trial, Mitch experiences trials and tribulations such as a hit that is put out on the kid. Mitch has Ray be a fake hit man who solicits the hit after hearing the father of the slain student put the hit out. At the end of the episode, Mitch engages in a business relationship with another firm.  Production  Lucas performed several takes of the opening chase scene at the Lincoln Memorial on September 13, 2011.  Reception  Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara describes the pilot as \\"overstuffed with story and overburdened by the 20 years since the John Grisham novel was published\\". McNamara notes that despite the initial frenetic chase, the show gets mired in flashbacks and abundant story lines that it is burdened with to explain the current setting. Mike Hale of The New York Times considers the premiere to be uncoordinated: \\"In the premiere, unfortunately, the case of the week and the background story seem to be competing to see which can be sillier.\\" Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch complains that its attempt to be edgy is more often trite: \\"With its frantic pace, jumpy cameras and pounding soundtrack right out of a videogame loop, 'The Firm' is determined to prove right out of the gate how edgy it is. What it is, more often, is trite.\\" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle notes that although the show has largely credible attention to details, the opening chase scene has one exception: \\"Reaching the edge of the Reflecting Pool, at the Capitol, Mitch steps over a low barrier and crosses the shallow water to the other side.\\" Oddly the pursuers \\"...go all the way around the basin to try to head him off instead of running after him through the water...\\" Pennington notes that as the chase ends with him \\"leaping cartoonishly into the bed of a pickup. All that's missing is the truck careening into a fruit stand.\\" Robert Bianco of the USA Today claims that \\"a show that opens with that kind of casual, incompetent stupidity is telling you how little effort it plans to expend on telling its story, and how little respect it has for your intelligence.\\"  Ratings  \\"Pilot/Chapter Two\\" was seen by 6.32 million American viewers, and received a 1.4/3 Nielsen rating/share in the 18–49 demographic.

He was born at Poupouma, in Nkol Okala a village in the Province du Centre to the north-west of Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, and died 11 November 2002, at Yaounde, On 17 June 1939, he enlisted voluntarily as a sergeant in the Cameroon militia, due to his imposing stature (1.88m) and his strategic skills, to the 1er régiment de tirailleurs du Cameroun (First Regiment of Cameroon Rifles); and later as a staff sergeant in the Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit. After the war, he married in the Christian tradition Rita Essah Tsimi, with whom he had ten children (Casmile, Jeanne, Etienne, Agrippine Awoundza, Lazare Ekongo, Métila Françoise, Essah Nathalie, Zobo Ostomac, Akamba Marie-Solange, and Nsing Marius Patrice). He was made a French citizen in 1951 by President Charles de Gaulle.  World War II  At the outbreak of World War II the militia of Cameroon for the most part joined the Free French forces, led by Captain (later Colonel then General) Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque. As such, Raphaël Onana was involved in the Gabon Campaign in November 1940, and the Syria–Lebanon Campaign from June to December 1941. The rifles of the Raphaël Onana's regiment were models MAS-36. Cameroon rallied to Free France in July 1940, as did the majority of educated Cameroonians, but some German-speaking Cameroonians were arrested and convicted of spying for Nazi Germany. On 28 December 1941, Onana was deployed to the desert. Thus he became a companion in arms of veterans of the Battle of Bir Hakeim, which held back Erwin Rommel, after which Charles de Gaulle declared that they had been \\"the pride of France\\". It was at Bir Hakeim that Raphaël Onana was seriously injured by several 9×19mm Parabellum rounds from an MP 40 submachine gun during the night of 10 June 1942 and was taken prisoner. Deported to Italy, he was exchanged as a prisoner of war in November 1942. Repatriated, he received final discharge in April 1943, because of his war injury, amputating his left leg. In 1945 French Cameroon became a country under supervision of the United Nations, which had replaced the League of Nations. Then it became in 1946 an \\"associated territory\\" of the French Union. Despite the exceptional courage of Raphaël Onana, he could never become a warrant officer, because of the colour of his skin. The Free French Forces hesitated to promote a black Central African from non-commissioned officer to sergeant major. After the war Raphael Onana had supported the \\"Union fraternelle des anciens combattants d'expression Française africains et malgaches\\" (UFACEFAM) (tr: Fraternal Union of French-speaking Veterans of Africa and Madagascar) along with the Ambassador of France in Cameroon. He had been elected president of \\"l'Amicale des anciens Combattants du Cameroun\\" (tr: the Cameroon Association of Veterans) and was assisted by Doctor Simon Pierre Tchoungui, who was later a prime minister of Cameroon. Raphael Onana was invited to the Élysée Palace by President Charles de Gaulle in December 1962. There he was decorated with the National Order of the Legion of Honor and many other awards. Raphael Onana had been in combat with a famous soldier: Simon Bikié Noah, the grandfather of Yannick Noah, the winner of the 1983 French Open of international tennis. He knew him as a comrade-in-arms despite 20 years of age difference. Raphaël remembered having shared with him the experiences of command because Simon had the motivations of the tribal chief. When Raphaël had learned the death of his former colleague Simon Noah, who was killed by a Cameroonian soldier during the 1985 coup d'état in Cameroon, under the influence of the coups in Mauritania, Guinea and Sudan, he strongly protested the curfew ordered by the Cameroonian putsch. He immediately contacted Simon Pierre Tchoungui (the ex-Prime Minister of Cameroon) to make him familiar with the changes to the arrests by the putsch to secure his family and friends. Before the Independence of Cameroon on 1 January 1960, Raphael Onana was a judge in the French courts. Raphaël Onana in the Military uniform of the Free French Forces. Raphaël Onana, on the right, a young militiaman at 20 years age, with his comrade. His father, Ékongo Akon'Awana From the age of 3 years, Raphaël Onana spent his youth with much frustration caused by the loss of his father Ékongo Akon'Awana, who died at 33 years old. Local peasants held that he had been poisoned by sorcerers. He was raised by his mother Regina Awundza, who was a Béti and spoke an Éton dialect. He had two sisters, the eldest, Zobo, born in 1910, and the youngest, Ng'Onana, born in 1922. Between 1910 and 1919, there were four other children born, all boys, who consecutively died by way of disease. Ékongo Akon'Awana was a Bakassa warrior with an uncommon physical strength, courageous, dangerous, clever, cruel and bloodthirsty. Villagers near Poupouma had dishonoured his second wife and widow, Regina Awundza, and her children. His first wife, Métil, had a daughter, half-sister of Raphaël, Johanna Ngazomo Métila. Ékongo Akon'Awana felt himself unfortunate as not to have a male heir despite his polygamy and his prayers for Zamba Ntond'Obé, a pagan god that resembled the primordial deities Gaia or the mother goddess in Europe. Ékongo is a word of dialect which can mean lance or javelin, a symbol of the warrior during tribal wars. He was a pious pagan animist. Édounga Zoa, the Cameroonian sorcerer, told him that he had been cursed not to have a son because of his crimes to defend his territory of Poupouma. When Regina Awundza was pregnant, Ékongo Akon'Awana had given his agreement to the wizard Édounga Zoa, by his incantations, to have a son of irreproachable health. This had a special condition: stop killing passers-by. In this way, the sorcerer Édounga Zoa had declared, after finishing his incantations, \\"Regina Awundza, currently pregnant, would soon bring into the world a boy. He would never die, as his four elder brothers had. Instead, he will live very long time, have abundant offspring and experience glory....\\"\\"Régina Awundza, actuellement enceinte, mettra bientôt au monde un garçon. Celui-ci ne pourra jamais mourir, comme ses quatre autres frères aînés. Au contraire, il vivra très longtemps, aura une abondante progéniture et connaîtra la gloire...\\" This explains the word \\"sheltered\\" in the title of his work. The Onana family name In Cameroon, it is customary to take a name of someone else you love. Raphaël Onana had chosen to take the name of his younger sister, Ng'Onana, born in 1922, instead of taking the name his father Akon'Awana who had a bad reputation because of his crimes on Poupouma. Raphaël Onana wished to turn the page and make the villagers around Poupouma forget their anger.

According to Nielsen ratings, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Stewie\\" was watched by 5.63 million U.S. viewers and acquired a 2.8/7 rating. Plot Stewie is forced to come along to Brian's book reading. Brian makes up for keeping Stewie out all night (when Brian scores with a college girl) by taking Stewie to the park. There Stewie meets Penelope, a girl who takes revenge on a boy who pushes Stewie. Stewie discovers they share a love of mathematics and advanced weaponry. When he discovers that she actually managed to kill her mother, he becomes totally enamored. They wreak havoc all over the world, destroying the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China, causing India and Pakistan to conduct nuclear war with each other, and destroying Copenhagen with a tidal wave (while incorporating a Roaring Twenties theme). Brian tries to convince him that while Stewie causes chaos as part of a grand scheme, Penelope does it just for kicks. As Penelope plots to kill a teacher, Stewie tells her that Brian suggested they take it easy. Penelope demands that Stewie kill Brian. Stewie is reluctant due to their friendship. He tries to steel himself but ultimately cannot do it. Penelope decides to do the job herself. Stewie secretly thwarts several of her attempts before confessing all to Brian. Penelope and Stewie battle, and she agrees to leave Brian alone. Penelope kisses Stewie goodbye but leaves him hanging from a lampost. Brian thanks Stewie for saving his life. Meg makes her first appearance of the episode just before the credits roll. Meanwhile, Lois tires of being crushed at night by Peter in bed. She replaces their shared bed with twin beds. Unable to sleep alone, Peter proposes that he and Quagmire become bunk buddies. As their friendship blossoms, Quagmire gives Peter a \\"giggity band\\". Lois misses Peter and asks him to return. Peter rises from Quagmire's bed, revealing he has crushed the seriously injured Quagmire during the night. Production Cate Blanchett guest starred in this episode.

This episode received mainly positive reviews. Kevin McFarland from The A.V. Club gave a B+ grade. He liked the humor that is used in the episode, especially for Brian and Stewie's moments, saying \\"This episode featured a lot of the humor that frequently works for me. It focused on Brian’s snobbery at the book reading, seducing a college creative writing student at a Jonathan Franzen reading. I always like jokes that show Brian as a dog, so I found Stewie using the spray bottle to prevent Brian from hijacking the reading with his own work pretty hilarious.\\" However, he criticized how the family treats Meg, and disliked the sub-plot with Peter. Carter Doston of TV Fanatic gave a 3/5 rating. He enjoyed the Stewie and Penelope fight scene, calling it \\"entertaining\\", but said that \\"it wasn't as long and drawn-out as any of the Giant Chicken fights\\".

When Ross brags about their family vacations and that they plan to climb Mt. Everest, Peter decides the Griffins will also climb the mountain. When they return home, Peter realizes he overspoke and asks Lois to make up an excuse, but Lois is also annoyed by the Fishmans' smug attitude and proposes they actually climb Mt. Everest. Arriving in Nepal, the Griffins find the Fishmans, who are surprised they actually followed through with the trip. While climbing, they discover they are ahead of the Fishmans. But when they reach the top, they discover the Fishmans beat them there. As they start back down, things go awry when they get stuck on the mountainside in the middle of a massive storm.

Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"The only parts of this episode that didn't feel cobbled together from previous episodes and other shows (the mountain climbing plot, the cannibalism sequence, the family dinner gone awry) were the cutaways, which is pretty typical of Family Guy at this point.

The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on January 29, 2012. In this episode, Stewie befriends another boy named Scotty. When Scotty falls ill, Peter and Lois take him to the hospital, in which his parents disagree due to their religious beliefs. The episode was well received reviews for its cutaway gags and cultural references. This episode was written by Danny Smith and directed by Pete Michels. The episode features guest performances from Max Burkholder, Gary Cole, Rob Corddry, Judy Greer, Jonathan Morgan Heit, Kevin Michael Richardson, Sage Ryan, Nicole Sullivan, and Josh Robert Thompson along with several recurring voice actors for the series. This episode was named after the Bon Jovi song of the same name. Plot The Griffin family goes to the Quahog Public Library for the Children's Sing-a-long activity held by Bruce. While there, Stewie meets a boy named Scotty Jennings and his parents Ben and Hope, whom Lois and Peter befriend. Both Lois and Hope organize a play date for both their sons. Everything goes well until Scotty suddenly falls ill whilst playing with Stewie and passes out, so Lois and Peter rush him to the hospital. At the hospital, Dr. Hartman tells them that Scotty has Hodgkin's disease and needs urgent treatment or else he will die. When Scotty's parents Ben and Hope arrive, they confess that they already knew their son had cancer, but do not use modern hospital treatment due to their religious beliefs as Christian Scientists, stating that they use their faith as a medicine. Lois, with her contrasting religious beliefs, tries to convince them to let Scotty receive medical treatment. However, Ben and Hope remain hopeful that continuous prayers will save their son. Lois then seeks help from Joe, but he says the police are unable to intervene, as it would be a violation of Hope and Ben's right to practice their religion. As a last resort, Lois decides to take matters into her own hands by kidnapping Scotty and taking him to the hospital herself. Lois and Peter sneak up to the Jennings' house and get Scotty out successfully after Peter almost abducted Ben. While Lois and Peter are taking Scotty to the hospital, a news report by Tom Tucker reports on the abduction where Tricia Takanawa is speaking to Mayor Adam West about how to handle the recent kidnapping. Lois and Peter's plans are thrown into turmoil when news spreads of their kidnapping and a huge mob with Tricia and her cameraman (along with her super protective painter boyfriend, Tyrone) and the police with Joe stop them at the hospital. Ben and Hope arrive, and plead with Lois to return Scotty to them, but not before Lois explains that mankind has created modern medicine, which is also the product of what God allowed. She then states that if they want help from God, they should do the right thing for Scotty. Eventually, Ben and Hope agree and allow their son to go to the hospital to receive his treatments, prompting Peter to exclaim \\"Hey Everybody, We're All Gonna Get Laid!\\" Scotty ends up beating his cancer, but by this point, Stewie has found a new friend with leprosy. At the end of the show, Peter decides to study Christian Science and proves a theory by imagining himself as Duchess Kate Middleton at the Royal Wedding. While there, he asks Prince William when he thinks the Queen will die. Reception The episode received very positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club, a considerable critic of post-cancellation seasons of the show, gave the episode a B-, appreciating how it tackled religion in comparison to previous episodes, and enjoying several of the cutaway and filler gags, such as Mayor West claiming to be John Mayer. He disliked a joke about Count Dracula nearly catching HIV in San Francisco, however as he felt it was homophobic. A review by Kate Moon of TV Fanatic was even more overwhelmingly positive, claiming that the show delivered a \\"genuine message\\". She gave a 4.3/5 rating. Both reviews were favorable towards the opening credits. In its original broadcast on January 29, 2012, \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\" was watched by 5.92 million U.S. viewers and acquired a 3.1/7 rating in the 18–49 demographic.

The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 18, 2012. In this episode, Peter, Joe, Quagmire and Brian wake up in the hospital and realize their memories have been erased and the city of Quahog has been deserted. This episode was written by David A. Goodman and directed by Brian Iles. Plot When Peter and Brian leave to play laser tag with Joe and Quagmire, Lois reminds Peter that he has agreed to spend Sundays with his family, but Peter and Brian leave anyway. Peter wins at laser tag and buys a fake newspaper that says he destroyed the world. He comes home to a furious Lois. Brian defends Peter but Lois claims that Brian is just taking his side because they hang out and would never have been friends if it was not for circumstance. Despite further objections, Brian and Peter head out with Joe and Quagmire to go drinking at the Drunken Clam. On the way they see strange lights in the road, run into them, and black out. They wake up in a hospital with no memory of who they are, and as they investigate, they discover that Quahog is completely deserted except for them. Walking on, they chance upon Peter's wrecked car by the roadside. They work out that it is indeed his car and discover his address. They also assume that they are the last people on Earth. When they find Spooner Street, Brian realizes that they live there, but they make wrong assumptions such as that Joe is a stripper (due to finding a cop's uniform) and Brian is Quagmire's dog (due to Brian defecating on Quagmires lawn). At Peter's house the other three see the fake newspaper front page Peter bought after his laser-tag win; from this they suspect that Peter is an alien who has killed the rest of the world. Joe and Quagmire search for weapons while Brian spies on Peter, but by the time Joe and Quagmire return, Brian and Peter have bonded so that Brian warns Peter and they try to escape but the others intercept them. As Joe fires toward Peter, Brian jumps in front of Peter to sacrifice himself for him. Peter picks up and cries over Brian's dead body. Brian wakes up, startled and confused. It turns out Stewie had captured them and hooked them to a computer system simulating the world to see if Brian and Peter were just friends through circumstance, but the simulation has proved they do belong together. Then Brian notices that Stewie has attached Lois, Meg, and Bonnie to an identical system, but instead of investigating their circumstances, or even discovering each other's names, the women are fighting. Reception In its original broadcast on March 18, 2012, \\"Forget-Me-Not\\" was watched by 5.61 million viewers and acquired a 2.8/7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C+, saying \\"I liked a lot of the throwaway lines and cutaway material packed around the central plot, but when Family Guy goes all in on one plotline without any other runners, it’s a make-or-break choice. This question about Brian and Peter’s owner/pet relationship didn’t really need this sort of musing, as I’m still not sure this answer will make past episodes clearer, or influence their relationship going forward. It’s just a statement because the show felt like it needed to make one now, and the dynamic of the show will change as needed, ultimately rendering this revelation and confirmation of Peter and Brian’s friendship useless.\\" David A.

The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on May 13, 2012. In this episode, Peter joins the Tea Party movement and, along with his father-in-law, Carter, successfully shuts down the government. However, things do not turn out as expected, and Peter has to find out a way to make things the way they were. The episode was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Pete Michels. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and cultural references. It was viewed by 4.94 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings. The episode features guest performances from Kirker Butler, Chris Cox, Ralph Garman, Ari Graynor, Alexa Ray Joel, Christine Lakin, Tara Strong, Nicole Sullivan, Julius Sharpe, and Fred Tatasciore, along with several guest performers for the series. Plot At the grand re-opening of Goldman's Pharmacy, Peter finds a \\"come in, we're open\\" sign on the front door, and decides to buy one. After people mistake the sign as a business, Peter decides to go into business for himself. The business, however, becomes short-lived when Joe is forced to shut him down for having an unlicensed business. After fighting City Hall and losing, Peter finds a sympathetic ear in Quagmire when they see a news report about the Tea Party and decide to join, much to the dismay of Brian, who informs him that the Tea Party is really a tool of big business. Joe tags along with Peter and Quagmire to a rally where Peter's father-in-law, Carter, is posing as an everyday worker named \\"Joe Workingman\\". Following the rally, Peter stops inside to use the restroom, where he finds Carter. Although he manages to persuade Peter that the two are separate, Carter enlists Peter to help get rid of the government. Despite the family's resistance, Peter makes calls for Carter on behalf of the Tea Party and successfully campaigns to have Mayor West shut down Quahog's government. The citizens of Quahog celebrate their new freedom from government, getting away with many things. From Quagmire marrying and impregnating a giraffe and flatly telling that the giraffe's son is not his, to Chris taking Mescaline and going to Las Vegas in the midst of a hallucination (referencing Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). However, Brian makes the Griffins aware of Carter's pollution, and as time goes on things get worse, up to the point where basic services (such as electricity and plumbing) are completely inaccessible and the citizens start rioting in the streets. After visiting Carter to help him and getting turned down by him, Peter calls the town together. He delivers a heartfelt speech about the government, although he manages to present it as an \\"entirely new thing\\". After convincing the citizens to successfully reform the government, Peter looks on the Internet to see what people are saying about him, only to be disappointed by the result. Production and cultural references Tara Strong guest starred in this episode \\"Tea Peter\\" was written by Patrick Meighan and directed by Pete Michels.

The episode received mixed reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave a C+ rating. He stated that \\"the thin plot arc didn't do much for [him]\\", however praising the \\"cutaways which made [him] laugh\\". He also noted that \\"[the episode] seems to believe that every follower of the Tea Party movement would propose exactly the same type of government in place now once mass lawlessness overtook the land by following their proposed ideas\\". He continued, \\"I didn't buy that final step, but it was the only bit of irony in the entire plot, and I appreciate whenever Family Guy goes for satire with a bit of meaning instead of shouting distilled vitriol for its perceived opponents from a soapbox.\\" Carter Doston of TV Fanatic gave a 2.7/5 rating. He criticized the lack of comedy used, \\"Seth MacFarlane is a noted liberal, and the politics of the show follow the same track, so an episode mocking the rise of this provocative conservative political movement was inevitable. The problem is that the show forgot to make it funny.\\" He also said \\"this episode did nothing more than state the obvious, and in a way that was neither profound nor at the very least entertaining.\\" References External links *\\"Tea Peter\\" at the Internet Movie Database *\\"Tea Peter\\" at TV.com 2012 American television episodes Family Guy (season 10) episodes Tea Party movement ","title":"Tea Peter"},{"id":"34305200","text":"Grenville Dean Wilson (January 26, 1833 - September 20, 1897), was an American pianist and composer, who composed over 150 pieces, mostly for piano solo.

She served on what is now the British Columbia Coast from 1859 until sold into commercial service in 1868. She sank with significant loss of life as result of a fire in 1883. Naval service The Grappler was one of about 100 Albacore-class gunboats that the Admiralty had built to meet the needs of the Crimean War. Like the others of her class, she was completed as that war ended. The Admiralty dispatched her, along with her sister ship, , to British Columbia following the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858. Vancouver Island service On the Pacific Station Grappler played an important role in the early history of the Colony of Vancouver Island. Under the command of Lieutenant Edmund Hope Verney, Grappler transported the first 35 British settlers to a new settlement at Comox on 2 October 1862 at the request of Governor James Douglas. She continued to act as a transport for the settlement before other transport was available. She also helped enforce the regulation of the liquor trade in the colony. Her small size, steam power, and shallow draft made her useful as a lighthouse tender, for rescue, and for laying navigation buoys. She and Forward were involved in the Lemalchi incident in the spring of 1863 when they hunted down and captured natives believed to have murdered some Gulf Island settlers. Forward used her guns to level a village on Kuper Island; she then transported her captives to Victoria where they were tried and hanged. Civilian service and fate Grappler was paid off on 13 May 1865 and sold for $2,400 in 1868. She was modified by the addition of deck house and put into commercial service for the next 15 years. HMS Grappler, shown here in later service as a packet steamer, brought the first settlers to the Comox Valley in 1862. File:Grappler.jpg On 29 April 1883, while in Discovery Passage about 4 miles south of Seymour Narrows, a fire was discovered in her boiler room. There were only two lifeboats aboard, one of which overturned. There were 36 survivors. Because the ship's records were lost, the number who perished in the sinking is uncertain but is believed to be between 70 and 90. At an inquest which followed, it was found that the vessel was not licensed to carry passengers aboard and the owners had failed to make provisions for their safety.

It was founded in 1854 by Italian immigrants Antonio Arighi and Antonio Bianchi who originated from the village of Casnate on the shores of Lake Como. The shop is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It has a cast iron and glass frontage, and stands is to Macclesfield Station and Tesco. The four-storey shop front was inspired by Paxton’s Crystal Palace of 1851. It was the work of a local builder George Roylance. It was saved from demolition in 1973 after a campaign supported by the Victorian Society, the Architectural Review magazine and Sir John Betjeman. History Arighi Bianchi (pronounced a-ree-ghee bee-an-key) has been involved with furniture for over 150 years. In 1854 Antonio Arighi left the tiny silk-weaving town of Casnate near Lake Como to escape the ravages of the Italian civil war. After crossing the Alps by toboggan, Antonio arrived in Macclesfield, Cheshire. Antonio was soon joined by his nephew Antonio Bianchi, and the two men swiftly set up in business as cabinet makers. The 19th century progressed not without incident, with Arighi’s intervention helping to save the town from flooding in 1872 and the decision to move to the current site in 1883. In the early 20th century, the store supplied furniture to Marlborough House and Sandringham House, by Royal Appointment of Edward VII, Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary.

When her husband's chemical plant was confiscated by the Nazi regime, she left her homeland of Germany and traveled with her husband and daughter before moving to New York City in 1937. In 1938 she left her husband and moved to Los Angeles, where she spent the rest of her life. She began a photographic career of children's portraits and quickly gained notoriety among Hollywood stars. She worked as an archivist for the Pasadena Art Museum's Blue Four Collection. At the end of World War II, she organized a friendship correspondence between children in California and Ryswyck, Holland out of gratitude for Ryswyck citizens' assistance to holocaust refugees. At age 50, Valeska began painting and at age 70 began sculpting. She was featured in the Emmy award winning NBC documentary \\"The Heart Is Not Wrinkled\\" in 1969. Valeska's photographs were always taken at her subjects' homes rather than a studio, a method she used to capture real people alive in their own environments. Never having been formally trained as an artist, her artwork expresses her soul rather than technical proficiency. Valeska and Galka Scheyer are credited with introducing German Expressionism to the Southern California art scene through her work with the Blue Four. Early life Valeska Heinemann was born in Braunschweig, Germany, to the owners of a department store. Although she was of Jewish heritage, her family was assimilated into German society and she had little interest in her roots during her youth. She attended a girls school from 1891 to 1901, after which she studied English, French and Italian language and literature for eight years with private tutors. She began experimenting with photography at age 12 and carried a camera everywhere she went. From 1911 to 1914 she worked as a German language secretary for an engineering magazine in Brussels, Belgium. After returning to Braunschweig and back to Brussels, she married Ernst Heyman, the owner of a chemical factory in Frankfurt in 1920. They lived in Frankfurt with their daughter, Hella, until 1932, when the family moved to Paris. The Nazis confiscated the chemical factory a year later, but Ernst opened another branch of the factory, which funded their travels to Palestine and throughout Europe. In 1937 Valeska, Ernst and Hella emigrated to New York. A year later, Valeska and Ernst separated and Valeska moved to Los Angeles at the request of her childhood friend, Galka Scheyer. Photographic career Shortly after Valeska arrived in Los Angeles, she secured permission to photograph children at UCLA's elementary school for education purposes. She created her own exhibit for parents and teachers in 1939, and later her photographs were used to illustrate the school's nursery and kindergarten education program to educators throughout California. Valeska's photographs of schoolchildren captured the attention of Los Angeles. Mrs. David Selznick asked Valeska to photograph a day in her children's lives, and her husband was so impressed that he commissioned her to photograph Hollywood stars. This launched her into a career of photographing celebrities and their families at home, including Elizabeth Taylor, Gregory Peck, Mickey Rooney, Rita Hayworth, Jennifer Jones, James Stewart, Rhonda Fleming, Joseph Cotten, Natalie Wood and Margaret O'Brien. Valeska led several other photography projects. In 1942, the California Department of Education assigned Valeska to photograph a typical day in a one-room rural school for member nations of the Inter-American educational conference. In 1951, the Council of Jewish Federations of Greater Los Angeles requested that she photograph Israel's destitute for refugee relief fundraisers. In December 1941, Valeska's photographic career was interrupted when the US government confiscated her cameras because she was not a US citizen. The principal of UCLA's elementary school and other individuals familiar with Valeska's work wrote letters to the attorney general vouching for her support of the US government and requesting the return of her cameras. The cameras were returned shortly, but with restrictions upon their use. In November 1945, at the end of World War II, Valeska established a friendship campaign between the children of Los Angeles and Ryswyk, Holland, a town whose residents protected her friends and other Jews from the Holocaust. She contacted the mayor of Ryswyk and received the names and addresses of the city's children. The campaign started at the UCLA elementary school, whose students \\"adopted\\" children in Ryswyk and sent them letters, clothes and food. Soon children throughout Los Angeles were encouraged to participate in the campaign, and over 2,000 children in Ryswyk received packages. Other American cities were inspired by this program and established their own friendship campaigns with other European cities affected by the war. In 1950, Valeska visited Ryswyk where she was greeted by parades and ceremonies and titled \\"The Mother of Ryswyk\\". Painting and Sculpture Career Still Waiting by Lette Valeska, 1945. Galka Scheyer encouraged Valeska to begin painting in 1939, at the age of 54, despite the fact that she had no formal training. Scheyer had been teaching children to paint spontaneously and expressively, and she welcomed Valeska's inexperience with the medium. Valeska developed her own painting style, characterized by elongated faces and richness in color and detail, although some paintings are muted and somber. Her art depicts Jewish religious motifs and Jewish suffering, although she had grown up removed from these religious and cultural experiences. Her relatives' and her own experiences with the Nazi regime motivated her to rediscover her Jewish roots. When she moved to Los Angeles, she studied Jewish history and literature, joined the Los Angeles Hadassah chapter and participated in other Jewish organizations. Valeska claimed that themes for her paintings were \\"born unconsciously\\" from a greater force, however. Her paintings have appeared in gallery exhibitions including her own one-woman show at the La Tortue gallery in Santa Monica in 1970. Valeska began sculpting with clay in 1955 at the age of 70 with the guidance of Jane Ullman, a sculptor. She had no formal training in this medium either, and she continued to depict Jewish themes in her sculpture. Her sculpture was exhibited at Brandeis University in 1966 and alongside her paintings and photographs in a one-woman show at the Los Angeles Jewish Community Building in 1980, among other venues.

The term suggests eight radiuses, the design incorporating four arcs of a large circle to comprise most of the structure, and four arcs of a smaller circle to round out the corners. It was a variant on the archetypal multi-purpose stadiums of the time, many of which were either conventionally circular or oval, and were often criticized for poor sight line angles for many spectators at baseball and football games. The most prominent examples of the octorad style were Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, which opened in 1967 and still exists; and Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, which opened in 1971 and has since been demolished. Both stadiums accomplished the goal of providing better sight lines for spectators. However, the architecture of those two stadiums still put a large majority of the fans far away from the action.

Although Byzantine authors use the term to describe the lands along the Danube in general, the province of Paristrion seems to have comprised mostly modern Dobruja.. It is not certain exactly when the province was established: the Romanian scholar Nicolae Bănescu considered that it was established immediately after the end of the Rus'–Byzantine War of 970–971, while others, such as Vasil Zlatarski, thought it a later, mid-11th century creation. It was governed by a katepano or a doux, and was probably based at Dorostolon (modern Silistra), where a Byzantine strategia (\\"generalcy\\") is indeed attested in the 970s.. In the aftermath of his victory over the Rus', Emperor John I Tzimiskes (r. 969–976) appointed general Leo Sarakenopoulos as commander over north-eastern Bulgaria, based at Pereyaslavets/Ioannopolis. Sarakenopoulos and his subordinates engaged in major fortification activities in the region of the Dobruja over the next few years, where abandoned Roman-era forts were rebuilt and re- occupied.. The region however fell back under Bulgarian control under the Cometopuli brothers in 986 and was held until c. 1001, when Byzantine control was re-established. Bănescu, however, considered that Dorostolon at least remained in Byzantine hands throughout.. From the 1030s on, the region faced the continuous raids of the Pechenegs. The population was withdrawn to a few large fortified centres, and the Pechenegs were allowed to settle in the province as allies and colonists (termed mixobarbaroi by contemporary authors) and kept pacified through subsidies and through a vibrant trade. It was not until the early 1070s that the Pechenegs launched an open rebellion, and posed a constant threat to the Byzantine Empire's Balkan provinces until decisively defeated at the Battle of Levounion in 1091. Despite occasional Cuman raids thereafter, the Paristrion remained largely peaceful and prosperous in the 12th century.cf. . The province seems to have been disbanded by the late 12th century.

Life John Hutchins was born at Bradford Peverell, Dorset, on 21 September 1698. He was the son of Richard Hutchins (died 1734), who was for many years curate there, and from 1693 rector of All Saints', Dorchester. His mother, Anne, died on 9 April 1707, and was buried in Bradford Peverell Church. His early education was under the Rev. William Thornton, master of Dorchester Grammar School, and on 30 May 1718 he matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford. In the next spring (10 April) he migrated to Balliol College, and graduated B.A. on 18 January 1722, but for some unknown reason became M.A. from Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1730. Late in 1722 or early in 1723 he was ordained, and served as curate and usher to George Marsh, who from 1699 to 1737 was vicar of Milton Abbas and the master of its grammar school. In his native county Hutchins remained for the rest of his life. Through the interest of Jacob Bancks of Milton, he was instituted to the rectory of Swyre (Holy Trinity) on 22 August, and to that of Melcombe Horsey in 1733. He became rector of Holy Trinity, Wareham, on 8 March 1744, but he retained the cures of Swyre and Wareham until his death. Political agitation among his parishioners at Wareham involved him in difficulties, and his weak voice and growing deafness diminished his influence in the pulpit. On Sunday, 25 July 1762, when the town of Wareham was devastated by fire and his rectory-house was burnt to ashes, his topographical papers were rescued by Mrs. Hutchins at the risk of her life. At the end of his days Hutchins was seized by a paralytic stroke, but he still laboured at his history of Dorset. On 21 June 1773 Hutchins died, and was buried in the church of St. Mary's, Wareham, in the old chapel under its south aisle. A monument on the north wall of the church commemorated his memory. An engraving by John Collimore of a portrait of Hutchins by Cantlo Bestland appeared in Peregrine Bingham's Memoir (1813). Hutchins' library was sold by Thomas Payne in 1774. Works Jacob Bancks, his patron, urged Hutchins to compile a county history of Dorset; and Browne Willis, when visiting in 1736, persuaded him to undertake the work. Three years later Hutchins circulated from Milton Abbas a single-sheet folio of six queries, with an appeal for aid, which was drawn up by Willis and printed at his cost. The work dragged for many years, but a handsome subscription encouraged the compiler in 1761 to search the principal libraries and the records in the Tower of London. In 1774, after his death, it was published in two folio volumes as the History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset, but there was prefixed a dedication by Hutchins, dated 1 June 1773. The volumes rose in value. The first volume of a second edition was issued in 1796 and its successor in 1803, but all that was printed of the third volume, with the exception of a single copy preserved in Richard Gough's library at Enfield, and all the unsold copies of vols. i. and ii., were consumed by fire at the printing-house of John Nichols on 8 February 1808. Nichols printed an appeal for support, and in 1813 the third volume appeared with Gough's name as its editor. The fourth volume came out in 1815. On this edition John Bellasis spent much of his own money. A further edition was published in four volumes (1861, 1864, 1868, and 1873). It began under the editorship of William Shipp and James Whitworth Hodson; Shipp was sole editor from 1868, and although the prolegomena are dated September 1874 he died on 8 December 1873. Parts of this history were subsequently issued separately. From the first edition were extracted descriptions of Poole and Stalbridge, and A View of the Principal Towns, Seats, Antiquities in Dorset (1773). Accounts of Milton Abbas, Shaftesbury, and Sherborne were selected from the second edition, and a history from the Blandford division, taken from the last impression, was circulated in 1860. Further use was made in Doomsday Book for Dorset by William Bawdwen. Letters by Hutchins are published in Nichols's Illustrations of Literature and Literary Anecdotes, William Stukeley's Family Memoirs (Surtees Society), and in Notes and Queries, 5th ser. x. 343. Hutchins contributed a memoir of Jacob Bancks to the London Magazine in May 1738. Family Hutchins married Anne, daughter of Thomas Stephens, rector of Pimperne, Dorset, at Melcombe Horsey on 21 December 1733; she died on 2 May 1796, aged 87. Their daughter, Anne Martha, married, 3 June 1776, at St. Thomas's (now the cathedral), Bombay, John Bellasis, then major of artillery in the service of the East India Company at Bombay, and afterwards major- general and commander of the forces at Bombay. She died at Bombay on 14 May 1797, and her husband on 11 February 1808.

It was the world's deadliest ever ballooning disaster until February 2013, when a balloon accident near Luxor, Egypt killed 19 people. , it remains the deadliest ever ballooning accident in Australia, and the third-deadliest worldwide, surpassed only by the Egypt crash and a balloon accident in Texas in 2016 that left 16 people dead. Accident The flight took off at Santa Teresa Road, 29 kilometres south east of Alice Springs. The accident was the result of a mid-air collision at 6:38 am, local time. One balloon ascended, colliding with another balloon above it. The envelope of the lower balloon engulfed the basket of the upper balloon, causing a tear in the envelope. The lower balloon hovered briefly, before rapidly deflating and plunging to the ground at high speed, killing its pilot and all twelve passengers. One body was reportedly thrown clear of the basket. The pilot had turned off the gas burners before impact. The male pilot and ten of the passengers were Australian. Six of the passengers were male and six female. One male passenger was Danish and another male passenger was an Italian who lived in Monaco. All of the passengers were adults. The descent reportedly lasted 51 seconds. Witness statements said the balloon \\"folded and fell to earth\\" and that it \\"fell to the ground like a streamer\\". A tourist in another balloon said, The tear in the stricken balloon's red and black envelope was described as being the size of a bed sheet, and the balloon crashed between two small trees in open scrubland about 16 kilometres from Alice Springs Airport. Another news report said that ten bodies, arms interlinked, were found in the balloon's gondola. Three others were nearby in the sand, having apparently been ejected. Four balloons were in the air at the time of the accident. The pilot of one of the other balloons had made a radio call to alert the emergency services. Passengers of the other balloons were treated in hospital for shock on their return to Alice Springs. Investigation The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) found that the operator of the upper balloon, the operator of the ballooning company to which both balloons belonged, had failed to give way to the lower balloon as required by the company's operations manual. The investigation report said that the upper balloon was found to be missing the mandatory instrument package and that its pilot had refused to cooperate with investigators. Both balloons were fitted with ultra high frequency radios operating on the same channel, but neither pilot contacted the other. The investigation found also that the pilot of the lower balloon, which crashed, had failed to properly assess the position of the upper balloon before ascending in close proximity to it. The investigation reported that the balloon plunged 2000 feet. The report said safety measures flowing from its investigation were now being implemented and that the Civil Aviation Authority should improve surveillance. Aftermath In 1992, the Northern Territory Supreme Court sentenced the pilot of the upper balloon, Michael Sanby, to two years' jail, with an eight-month non-parole period, after an eight-man, four- woman jury had found him guilty of committing a dangerous act. He was found not guilty on 13 charges of manslaughter. The charge of committing a \\"dangerous act\\" was reported at the time as being unique to the Northern Territory. The judge found that the pilot had \\"failed to keep a proper lookout for a period of 30 seconds (during which the other balloon was hidden from view) and that the failure seriously endangered the lives of those below\\". During his 13-week trial, the court was told that Sanby had outlaid about $1 million of borrowed money to get into the new commercial hot-air ballooning industry, and that business at Toddy's Safari Ballooning was booming. Sanby's conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal. Sanby was imprisoned for five years for fraud connected to a separate business endeavour, in the District Court of Gympie, Queensland, in August 2014.

The area surrounding the stream is on the outskirts of the Perth CBD and is part of the suburb of East Perth. Claise Brook was once an important water course from which the numerous interconnected fresh water lakes north of Perth emptied into during the wet season before entering the Swan River.Sense of Place, George Seddon, University of Western Australia Press, Perth, 1972 History Since the gradual resumption of land over the various feeder lakes, and more recently the East Perth redevelopment in the late 1980s, the stream has become a mainly underground catchment and drainage system and no longer exists as a stream in the normal sense. The stream and cove were initially called Mandalup, meaning \\"place of the small marsupial\\". It was later named Clause's Brook and Clause's Lagoon respectively, however these names appear to have been dropped soon after European settlement: an 1851 newspaper report spoke of the establishment of an abattoir at \\"Claise Brook\\". They were named after Frederick Clause who was a naval surgeon that accompanied Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling in their expedition up the Swan River in March 1827. Botanist Charles Fraser who was on the same expedition described the lagoon in his journal: > \\"One mile up the river from the last point is a small creek of fresh water, > issuing from an extensive lagoon clothed with arborescent species of > Metrosideros of great beauty. The banks are covered with the most > interesting plants, amongst which I observed two species of Calytris, a > species of Acacia with a scolopendrous-stem, and several Papilionaceous > plants. The Angophoras on the flats are gigantic.\\" Since the latter half of the 1800s until the mid-1980s, the area around Claise Brook and Claisebrook Cove was used for mainly industrial purposes and the water quality and surrounds were badly degraded. During this period it was also widely referred to as Claisebrook Drain. In the late 1800s and early 1900s it had become an effluent outlet into the river. In 1906 the Claisebrook and Burswood Sewerage Treatment Works was built. Sewerage was pumped across the river from Claise Brook to ponds and filter beds on Burswood Island. East Perth Gasometer and East Perth Power Station were prominent structures there for many years during the 1900s, both on the northern side of the river outlet. Prior to the redevelopment from the mid-1980s, a major environmental remediation project was undertaken to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated soils created by the East Perth Gas Works which operated there from 1922 to 1971. The plant produced gas from coal. Remediation included dredging of of adjacent riverbeds and removal and treatment of of soil. Redevelopment The precinct surrounding the Cove is now known as Claisebrook VillageMetropolitan Redevelopment Authority and is now mainly residential. The Cove is now a heavily landscaped artificial inlet of the Swan River overlooked by residential buildings and bars, cafes and restaurants. Facilities include moorings and jetties for recreational boating and Trafalgar Bridge which is a pedestrian footbridge which crosses the cove. Crossing the river nearby is Matagarup Bridge, Goongoongup Railway Bridge and Windan Bridge which carries road traffic from the Graham Farmer Freeway.

The \\"karuta\\" are small square or rectangle plates of iron or leather connected to each other by kusari (chain mail) or laced to each other, with the plates sewn to a cloth backing, individual karuta armour plates could also be sewn directly to a cloth backing without being connected to each other. Chest armor was commonly made from karuta (karuta tatami dou). Karuta jackets (karuta katabira) were also made. Various other parts of armor were made from karuta including thigh guards (karuta haidate), shoulder guards (karuta sode) and karuta hoods (karuta zukin). Karuta armor was worn by all classes of samurai, even the foot soldiers (ashigaru). High quality armor was more elaborate and ornate, while the lower quality sets of armor were plain but offered basic protection.The samurai: warriors of medieval Japan, 940-1600, Anthony J.

Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, p. 2. notranjščinaLogar, Tine. 1996. Dialektološke in jezikovnozgodovinske razprave. Ljubljana: SAZU, p. 65.) is a Slovene dialect in the Littoral dialect group. It is spoken in a relatively large area, extending from western Inner Carniola up to Trieste in Italy, also covering the upper Vipava Valley and the southern part of the Karst Plateau.  Geographic extension  The dialect is spoken in most of the municipalities of Postojna, Pivka, Ilirska Bistrica, Divača, Hrpelje-Kozina, Vipava, in most areas of the municipalities of Sežana and Ajdovščina, as well as the Municipalities of Monrupino and Sgonico in Italy, and in many Slovene- inhabited villages in the Municipality of Trieste (most notably in Opicina). It is bounded to the east by the Lower Carniolan dialect, to north by the Črni Vrh dialect, to the northwest by the Karst dialect, and to the southeast by the Rižana subdialect and Čičarija dialect.Toporišič, Jože. 1992. Enciklopedija slovenskega jezika. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, pp. 148–149. Phonological and morphological characteristics The Inner Carniolan dialect has a Lower Carniolan base. The dialect does not have pitch accent. Short syllables are frequently lengthened. Phonological developments include u > y, syllabic ł > ou, newly accented e > ie and o > uo/ua, and preservation of the cluster šč. There has been accentual simplification by replacing mobile accent with fixed accent position. Lexically, the dialect shows extensive influence from Romance languages.  Sociolinguistic aspects  About 90,000 Slovene speakers live in the areas where the dialect is traditionally spoken. Although there are no precise statistics, it is likely that a large majority of them have some degree of knowledge of the dialect. This makes it the most widely spoken dialect in the Slovenian Littoral and among the 10 most spoken Slovene dialects. In most rural areas, especially in the Vipava Valley and on the Karst Plateau, the dialect predominates over standard Slovene (or its regional variety). Differently from many other Slovene dialects, the Inner Carniolan dialect is commonly used in many urban areas, especially in the towns of Ajdovščina, Vipava, and Opicina (Italy). In the towns, where commuting to the capital, Ljubljana, is more common (Postojna), the dialect is being slowly replaced by a regional version of standard Slovene.  Culture  There is no distinctive literature in Inner Carniolan. However, features of the dialects are present in the texts of the Lutheran philologist Sebastjan Krelj (born in Vipava) and the Baroque preacher Tobia Lionelli (born in Vipavski Križ). The folk rock group Ana Pupedan uses the dialect in most of its lyrics. The singer-songwriter Iztok Mlakar has also employed it in some of his chansons. The comedian and satirical writer Boris Kobal has used it in some of his performances, and so has the comedian Igor Malalan.

This lease, however, was subject to a suspensive condition, clause 15(i): The lease was \\"to be confirmed by the lessor within 14 days after registration in the lessor's name.\\" On October 5, one \\"V,\\" on behalf of Sweet, applied to ABSA for a loan of R180,000 against the security of a first mortgage bond over the premises. In the application form, \\"V\\" declared that the particulars set out therein, to the best of his knowledge and belief, were true and correct, and that no information which might have affected bank's decision had been withheld. In response to a question in the application as to who would occupy the premises, \\"V\\" replied that it would be occupied by Sweet. In the space opposite the question \\"if tenanted, monthly rental?\\", the letters \\"N/A\\" appeared. \\"V\\" also agreed on behalf of Sweet that the latter would be bound by the bank's \\"standard conditions for mortgage loans,\\" one of which was contained in the mortgage bond and provided that the \\"mortgagor agrees that the mortgaged property shall not be let for a longer period than one month without the written consent of\\" the bank. The loan application was granted. On November 16, the premises were transferred to Sweet and the mortgage bond was registered. On November 20, Sweet endorsed on the lease, as contemplated by clause 15(i), the words \\"confirmed on 20/11/90.\\" Sweet failed to fulfil her obligations under the mortgage bond, so that, on September 19, 1991, the premises were sold by auction in execution of a judgment obtained by the bank against her. Clause 5 of the conditions of sale provided that the \\"property shall be sold subject to any existing tenancy. If the amount so realised is insufficient to meet the amount owing to the execution creditor, then the property shall be sold free of any tenancy entered into after the registration of the bond.\\" The bank purchased the property at the sale in execution for an amount which was less than the bond indebtedness of Sweet to the bank. The sheriff thereupon endorsed on the conditions of sale that, \\"in terms of clause 5 above, the property was sold free of any alleged leases.\\" The bank thereupon applied in a Provincial Division, inter alia, for the ejectment of the second respondent from the premises. The second respondent, in opposing the application, relied on the written lease with Sweet, contending that the sale of the premises to the bank at the sale in execution was subject to her tenancy in terms of the written lease, such lease having been concluded prior to the sale of the property to the bank and prior to the registration of the bond.  Principles  While the mutual rights of the parties to a contract which is subject to a suspensive condition relate back to the date of the contract where the suspensive condition is fulfilled, the third-party rights, which may have been acquired in good faith, pending the fulfilment of the suspensive condition, are not prejudiced by such retroactive operation of the contract.  Judgment  The court held that, having regard to the fact that the contract of lease was subject to the suspensive condition contained in clause 15(i), and therefore imperfectum or inchoate until the condition was fulfilled, the real right of the bank as mortgagee, created by the registration of the mortgage bond over the premises, ranked in preference to the real right of the second respondent as lessee. The second respondent's right was deemed to have come into existence retroactively or in accordance with the fiction of retroactivity, but it was not established until the suspensive condition had been fulfilled: Until then it was uncertain, whereas the bank's right as mortgagee was firmly and certainly established when the bond was registered. As the rights of the bank, as a third party in relation to the lease, were not prejudiced by the retroactive operation of the lease brought about by the fulfilment of the suspensive condition, the consequences of a lease subsequent in time to the mortgage bond followed. As the highest bid, when the premises were sold in execution, did not cover the mortgage debt, the property was correctly sold free of the lease. The court held further that there was no basis for holding that the bank knew of the existence of the lease at the time the mortgage was entered into, and that, accordingly, the bank was entitled to an order for the ejectment of the second respondent.

He was a police officer and pioneer member of the National Security Organization (NSO). He was also the first director of the National Intelligence Agency (NIA); and the second director of the State Security Service (SSS). Early life Albert Horsfall was born on 22 December 1941 at Buguma in present-day Rivers State. Albert Horsfall grew up in Degema, the administrative headquarters of Degema Division, one of the four divisions that made up the then Rivers Province. Horsfall's father was a successful merchant and he fathered 11 children; three of whom died. Albert left home at the age of seven to live with an uncle, Alex Horsfall, a top civil servant who lived at Degema Consulate. In 1947, Albert began his elementary schooling at Saint Batha School, Degema; he remembers walking from Degema Consulate, then an area populated by expatriates and Nigerian civil servants to his school. In 1951, Horsfall's schooling was disrupted by the death of his uncle Albert in the United Kingdom while taking in-service training. Albert had to return to his parents in Buguma, where he completed his primary education at Saint Michael's School, Emohua. In 1959, he graduated from Christ School of Commerce Onitsha, a school owned by his father's friend.  Early career  At age 17 in 1962, he joined the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) for cadet training, but had to wait a year before this could begin. In 1965, he completed his training with the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP). After a brief stint in Abakaliki, Horsfall was selected to join the Special Branch; at the time, the top three cadet graduates were selected for posting in either the A Department Force Headquarters, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), or the Special Branch. Soon after, Horsfall's boss and Special Branch commissioner, J. J. Sullivan, a retired British Major recognized Horsfall's potential and deployed him to the Border control unit at Enugu. At the time, most Nigerian officers in the Special Branch were regarded by the expatriate officers as being more loyal than intelligent. After Sullivan went on retirement leave, his Nigerian successor, T. H. Fagbola, who needed capable Nigerian officers to work with, assigned Horsfall back to headquarters in Lagos. Soon after, Horsfall attended an intelligence training course in the United States. While he was there in 1966, the Nigerian Civil War broke out. Horsfall, from the southern part of the country, returned to Nigeria on the side of the Federal Government. At the time, General Yakubu Gowon's government had dissolved the country's four regions—Northern Region, Western region, Mid- Western Region, and the Eastern Region—into 12 new states. This was calculated to fragment support for the seceding Biafran state, which was mostly made up of the Eastern Region and the Mid-Western State. Horsfall's new Rivers State was formerly part of the Eastern Region, which now sided with the Federal Government in the war. When Horsfall returned from the United States, the Special Branch was severely short-staffed because of the exodus of easterners to seceding Biafra. This situation thrust a greater workload on him and might in part also account for his rapid rise in the service. Horsfall claims to have been embedded with the federal troops in Opobo, Calabar, Onne, and Port Harcourt; he obviously would have held some advantage in this role because he was indigenous to the area. In 1972, Horsfall married Henrietta. She was one of a couple of young women he had helped move to Lagos to continue their education during the civil war, and he knew her family. They have seven children. National Security  National Security Organisation  Horsfall remained with the Special Branch until 1976, when the department was excised from the NPF due to the creation of the National Security Organization (NSO). Horsfall, by then an Assistant Commissioner of Police joined the NSO as an officer under the first Director-General, Colonel Abdullahi Mohammed. Albert Horsfall claims he had always wanted to study law but had not been able to because of the demands of his job. His former bosses at the Special Branch and the NSO, M. D. Yusuf and Abdullahi Mohammed, had refused his applications for a study leave on the grounds he was too useful to their organizations to lose. He eventually left the NSO without official leave to study law in 1979. He was able to do this during the handover period between the outgoing director general, Colonel Abdullahi Mohammed, and the incoming director general, Umaru Shinkafi. Horsfall alleged that Shinkafi was sympathetic to his cause because Shinkafi himself, a former commissioner of police, had also taken leave of the Police to study law. Horsfall rose through the ranks of the NSO and eventually became the agency's second deputy director general, replacing Peter Odukwe after he was retired in 1984 during a purge of Shinkafi-era operatives by the new NSO director general, Ambassador Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi. Horsfall held this position till the dissolution of the NSO in 1986 by the new military government headed by General Ibrahim Babangida. During his time as NSO deputy director general under Rafindadi, the agency was at its height of notoriety. Political repression was rife, arrest and detention without trial under the infamous Decree 2 (state security; detention of persons) and Decree 4 (press gag) was common. One of the more notorious actions of the NSO during this period was the \\"Dikko Affair.\\" The Dikko Affair was an attempt by the NSO and an Israeli collaborator to kidnap and repatriate second republic Transport Minister Alhaji Umaru Dikko from his United Kingdom exile in 1984. The attempt failed and Nigeria suffered great diplomatic and economic repercussions, Horsfall has denied any involvement in the attempt.  National Intelligence Agency  The Babangida government launched investigations into NSO activities under Rafindadi, a Commission of Inquiry headed by former NSO Director General Umaru Shinkafi was also instituted. The security services were reorganised under Decree 19 of 1986, which led to the creation of three agencies: the State Security Service (SSS), the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA). The new government appointed Horsfall the first director general of the NIA. The NIA was responsible for Nigeria's foreign intelligence.  State Security Service  Horsfall held this position until 1990, when he replace Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo as the SSS' fifth director general. On 10 October 1992, Horsfall left the SSS.  Later career   Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission  From 1993, he was the first chairman of the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC), a special purpose vehicle established by the government to bring about rapid development to the oil- producing Niger Delta; Horsfall is indigenous to the area. Horsfall hired Goodluck Jonathan, later a president of Nigeria, for OMPADEC, Jonathan's first public service job. On 22 February 1996, the OMPADEC Board was dissolved. Horsfall and the OMPADEC commissioners were removed based on claims by the Abacha government of widespread non-performance by contractors; the government claimed these contractors received mobilization money but failed to perform satisfactorily. This followed a prolonged campaign of calumny mounted by Dr. Junaid, the fiery advocate of northern supremacy who Horsfall forcefully removed from the OMPADEC Board in 1995. In defence of his role and integrity, Horsfall claimed with authentic figures and statistics from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) that during his three years of service in OMPADEC, the Commission had received only 11.48 billion naira approximately $133,488,372 from government through monthly disbursements from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and that with this paltry sum he had performed a near miracle by dotting the whole of the nine oil-producing states with several on-going, medium and major projects and actually completed and commissioned 102 such projects and put them in use by the various communities throughout those oil-producing states. Following the OMPADEC Commission's dissolution and the removal of Horsfall and his Board, five different investigation panels probed the allegations of corruption, uncompleted projects, and debts being owed by contractors to OMPADEC. These included a panel headed by the famous anti- corruption crusader Economics Professor Sam Aluko. None of these panels returned a verdict of corruption or improprieties on Horsfall.  Legal career  In 1997, he established his law firm, Horsfall and Company, a legal consultancy firm. He is retired from public service, and is enjoying his normal pension. He has been chairman or a member of several federal constitutional review bodies, special adviser to President Obasanjo on Niger Delta Development, rehabilitation of militant and delinquent Rivers State youth, a member of the Nigerian National Constitutional Conference 2014, and a member of its special committee of 50 \\"wise men.\\" References 1941 births Living people Rivers State lawyers People from Buguma Nigerian politicians Rivers State politicians People from Degema Ijaw people Directors General of the State Security Service (Nigeria) Nigerian security personnel ","title":"Albert Horsfall"},{"id":"34306149","text":"St. Mary's Hospital was a psychiatric facility located in the village of Burghill, Herefordshire. History Herefordshire initially utilised subscription asylum premises within the Hereford General Infirmary site and following the 1845 act entered into agreement with the Welsh counties of Monmouthshire, Radnorshire and Breconshire to construct the joint counties premises at Abergavenny. Breakdown of the union led to Herefordshire providing its own asylum located close to the County Town of Hereford. The facility was designed by architect Robert Griffiths, County Surveyor of Staffordshire, and the construction, which cost £87,873, started in 1868. It opened as the Hereford County and City Lunatic Asylum in August 1871. There were a further 100 acres of gardens, a farm and several cottages. The main asylum was divided into a block for men and one for women, each wing constructed to house 200 patients. The 1881 census reveals that few were under 20 years of age and again few were over 70. The head attendant, a 61-year old male, had become a private patient himself.1881 British Census and National Index, Family History Resource File, CD-Rom Library, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints The asylum appears to have been a well-run establishment and seems to have met with the approval of the Committee of Visitors in the years leading up to 1889. The chairman, B.L.S. Stanhope, expressed his satisfaction that \\"since the Asylum was opened, there is no record of any death of a homicidal or suicidal character; a fact testifying to the careful supervision exercised over the patients.\\" Final report of the Committee of Visitors presented to the Quarter Sessions, March 1889, Hereford Library 362.2. The facility was extended to a design by John Giles, Gough and Trollope in the early 20th century. It was renamed Burghill Mental Hospital in the 1930s. It joined the National Health Service in 1948 and was subsequently renamed St. Mary's Hospital, taking its name from the local parish church, in the 1930s.

The World Health Organization has prioritized the workplace as a setting for health promotion because of the large potential audience and influence on all spheres of a person's life.https://www.who.int/occupational_health/topics/workplace/en/ The Luxembourg Declaration provides that health and well-being of employees at work can be achieved through a combination of: * Improving the organization and the working environment * Promoting active participation * Encouraging personal development. Workplace health promotion combines alleviation of health risk factors with enhancement of health strengthening factors and seeks to further develop protection factors and health potentials.Burton, Joan. \\"WHO health workplace framework and model\\" (PDF). http://www.who.int/. Workplace health promotion is complementary to the discipline of occupational safety and health, which consists of protecting workers from hazards. Successful workplace health promotion strategies include the principles of participation, project management, integration, and comprehensiveness: * Participation: all staff must be included in all program stages * Project management: programs must be oriented toward the problem-solving cycle * Integration: programs must be incorporated into company management practices and workplace health- promotion strategies should influence corporate planning * Comprehensiveness: programs must incorporate interdisciplinary individual-directed and environment-directed health strategies.Chu, Cordia; Bruecker, Gregor; Harris, Neil; Stitzel, Andrea; Gan, Xingfa; Gu, Xueqi; Dwyer, Sophie (2000). “Health- promoting workplaces--international settings development.” Health Promotion International, 15.2, 155-167. A report by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work notes growing evidence that significant cost savings can be made by implementing workplace health promotion strategies, and over 90% of United States workplaces with greater than 50 employees have health promotion programs in place.Hassard, J (2012). “Motivation for employers to carry out workplace health promotion.” European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. Retrieved 9 February 2016.Aldana, Steven G. (2001). Financial impact of health promotion programs: a comprehensive review of the literature.” American Journal of Health Promotion, 15.5, 296-320.  Strategies to promote health in the workplace  Strategies for workplace health promotion need to be inclusive to account for diversity in the workforce, and behavioral economics is a key tool for implementing workplace health programs.Watson, Towers (2011). \\"Employee Engagement and Health Plan Management.” Towers Watson. Retrieved 9 February 2016. The United States Department of Health and Human Services includes five strategic guidelines for workplace health promotion in its Healthy People 2010 initiative. These include: * Health education, focused on skill development and lifestyle behavior change along with information dissemination and awareness building. * Supportive social and physical environments, reflecting the organization’s expectations regarding health behaviors and implementing policies promoting healthy behaviors. * Integration of the worksite program into the organization’s benefits, human resources infrastructure, and environmental health and safety initiatives. * Links between health promotion and related programs like employee assistance. * Screenings followed by counseling and education on how to best use medical services for necessary follow-up.Goetzel, Ron Z.; Henke, Rachel M.; Tabrizi, Maryam; Pelletier, Kenneth; Loeppke, Ron; Ballard, David W.; Grossmeier, Jessica; Anderson, David R.; Yach, Derek; Kelly, Rebecca K.; McCalister, Tre; Serxner, Seth; Selecky, Christobal; Shallenberger, Leba G.; Fries, James F.; Baase, Catherine; Isaac, Firky; Crighton, Andrew K.; Wald, Peter; Exum, Ellen; Shurney, Dexter; Metz, Douglas R. (2014). “Do Workplace Health Promotion (Wellness) Programs Work?” Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 56.9, 927-934. More generally, workplace health promotion efforts are implemented at three functional levels, including: * Level I: awareness programs such as newsletters, health fairs, and educational classes that may or may not directly improve individual health or influence behavioral change. * Level II: lifestyle modification programs of 8 to 12 weeks duration that are available to employees on an ongoing basis and directly influence health outcomes. * Level III: the creation of a work environment that assists employees in sustaining healthy lifestyles and behaviors, such as workplace cafeterias offering healthy food choices or the provision of workplace exercise facilities.Gebhardt, Deborah L.; Crump, Carolyn E. (1990). “Employee Fitness and Wellness Programs in the Workplace.” American Psychologist, 45.2, 262-272. In most instances physical activity interventions conform to Level II of this framework and may also include elements from Level III. Incentive- based Fitness Rewards Programs (FRPs) aim to influence employee behaviors and thereby conform to Level I.  Physical activity interventions  Approximately half of all current workplace health promotion programs are based on physical activity interventions given the relative ease by which employers can advocate such efforts to employees.Batt, Mark (2009). “Physical activity interventions in the workplace: the rationale and future direction for workplace wellness.” British Journal of Sports Medicine, 43, 47-48. Employer-sponsored activity interventions in the form of team sports originated as early as the 17th century in the United Kingdom, however, most 21st century interventions rely on employer sponsorship of employee access to health and fitness facilities.Mcgillivray, David (2005). “Fitter, Happier, More Productive: Governing Working Bodies Through Wellness.” Culture and Organization, 11.2, 125-138. Employee convenience to sponsored fitness facilities strongly influences program participation, and facilities located near employee locations of residence hold lower time costs, receive increased use, and yield better program and health outcomes.Abraham, Jean; Feldman, Roger; Nyman, John; Barleen, Nathan (2011). “What Factors Influence Participation in an Exercise-Focused, Employer-Based Wellness Program.” Inquiry, 48, 221-241. Women frequently demonstrate lower participation in workplace exercise programs than men, and young, single individuals are often more predisposed to pursue employer-sponsored physical activity initiatives.Erickson, Jill; Gillespie, Catherine (2000). Reasons Women Discontinued Participation in an Exercise and Wellness Program.” Physical Educator, 57.1, 2-6. In many cases, exercise-based workplace health promotion programs struggle to attract those who would benefit the most from such fitness efforts, including aging, sedentary, blue-collar, female, or less- educated employees.Pohjonen, Tiina; Ranta, Riika (2001). “Effects of Worksite Physical Exercise Intervention on Physical Fitness, Perceived Health Status, and Work Ability among Home Care Workers: Five-Year Follow-up.” Preventive Medicine, 32.6, 465-475. The sedentary nature of many modern workplaces increases negative metabolic risk factors such as high body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose and triglyceride levels. Breaking up long periods of sedentary time is shown to improve these risks.Carr, Lucas J.; Walaska, Kristen A.; Marcus, Bess H. (2012). “Feasibility of a portable pedal exercise machine for reducing sedentary time in the workplace.” British Journal of Sports Medicine, 46, 430-35.Lara, Agustin; Yancey, Antronette K.; Tapia-Conyer, Roberto; Flores, Yvonne; Kuri-Morales, Pablo; Mistry, Ritesh; Subirats, Elena; McCarthy, William J. (2008). “Pausa para tu Salud: Reduction of Weight and Waistlines by Integrating Exercise Breaks into Workplace Organizational Routine.” Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health Research, Practice, and Policy, 5.1, 1-9. Specifically, utilization of portable pedal exercise machines in office environments has been shown to improve employee health, and use was demonstrated feasible during working hours. Interventions using pedometers to influence employee behavior, decrease the duration of sedentary periods, and increase total movement during the work day have also proven successful.Chan, Catherine; Ryan, Daniel A.J.; Tudor-Locke, Catrine (2004). “Health benefits of a pedometer-based physical activity intervention in sedentary workers.” Preventive Medicine, 39, 1215-1222. Smartphone applications and workplace signs promoting stair use are known to improve employee health, and many employers are now investing in wearable technologies to encourage employees to monitor physical activity.Eves, Frank F.; Webb, Oliver J.; Mutrie, Nanette (2006-12-01). \\"A workplace intervention to promote stair climbing: greater effects in the overweight.” Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.). 14 (12): 2210–2216. doi:10.1038/oby.2006.259.

Workplace Tai Chi programs have also proven effective as a health intervention and means of reducing absenteeism, particularly in older workers.Palumbo, Mary V.; Wu, Ge; Shaner-McRae, Hollie; Rambur, Betty; McIntosh, Barbara (2012). “Tai Chi for Older Nurses: A Workplace Wellness Pilot Study.” Applied Nursing Research, 25.1, 54-59. Despite these efforts, many health promotion programs struggle with poor participation, and the introduction of incentives is shown to improve employee involvement.Baicker, Katherine; Cutler, David; Song, Zirui (2010). “Workplace Wellness Programs Can Generate Savings.” Health Affairs, 29.2, 304-311.  Incentive based programs  To encourage physical activity among the workforce, many employers offer financial incentives to employees through Fitness Rewards Programs (FRPs). Seeing that exercise and dieting produce immediate discomfort, the benefits of weight loss are often not noticeable in the short-term, and many people seek long-term health but succumb to near-term temptations of unhealthy eating and inactivity (hyperbolic discounting), maintaining employee involvement in wellness programs is difficult. To solve these problems of immediacy, salience, and hyperbolic discounting FRPs offer financial incentives to employees for healthy behaviors.Cawley, John; Price, Joshua (2013). “A case study of a workplace wellness program that offers financial incentives for weight loss.” Journal of Health Economics, 32, 794-803. Though lack of participation remains a problem even among well crafted FRPs, attrition is not random and greater weight loss success is associated with a reduction in later program dropout probability.  Effects of workplace health promotion  The positive impact of workplace health promotion programs on productivity is widely discussed. The impact of workplace health promotion on absenteeism is substantial since productivity is impossible if an employee is absent.Wolf, Kirsten (2008). “Health and productivity management in Europe.” International Journal of Workplace Health Management, 1.2, 136-144. However, the effects of presenteeism are also significant, and working while sick is estimated to cost the United States economy more than $150 billion per year.Hemp, Paul (2004). “Presenteeism: At Work--But Out of It.” Harvard Business Review, October. Absenteeism is estimated to cost the average employer $660 annually per employee.Navarro, Chris; Bass, Cara (2006). “The Cost of Employee Absenteeism.” Compensation Benefits Review, 38.6, 26-30. Based on productivity costs, employees experiencing negative health conditions or at risk of developing impaired health cost employers up to $1601 more than healthy employees per year.Mitchell, Rebecca; Bates, Paul (2011). “Measuring Health- Related Productivity Loss.” Population Health Management, 14.2, 93-98. Improvements in productivity and absenteeism following implementation of workplace health promotion programs can annually save employers $15.6 for every one dollar spent on health initiatives. More generally, employee health care costs and absentee day costs decrease by $3.27 and $2.73, respectively, for every dollar spent on workplace health promotion. In some cases, employer- based health programs have been shown to yield no reduction in health care spending or employer insurance outlay.Gowrisankaran, Gautaum; Norberg, Karen; Kymes, Steven; Chernew, Michael E.; Stwalley, Dustin; Kemper, Leah; Peck, William (2013). “A Hospital System’s Wellness Program Linked to Health Plan Enrollment Cut Hospitalizations But Not Overall Costs.” Health Affairs, 32.3, 477-485.Lerner, Debra; Rodday, Angie M.; Cohen, Joshua T.; Rogers, William H. (2013). “A Systematic Review of the Evidence Concerning the Economic Impact of Employee-Focused Health Promotion and Wellness Programs.” Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55.2, 209-222. Relevant to health outcomes, workplace health promotion programs have demonstrated numerous short and long term benefits. Significantly, workplace physical activity interventions are shown to improve employee fitness, activity behavior, unhealthy lipid levels, work attendance, and job stress, and workplace exercise programs are known to reduce supervisor stress and abusive supervision of subordinates, increasing productivity.Conn, Vicki S.; Hafdahl, Adam R.; Cooper, Pamela S.; Brown, Lori M.; Lusk, Sally L. (2009). “Meta- Analysis of Workplace Physical Activity Interventions.” American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 37.4, 330-339.Burnton, James; Hoobler, Jenny M.; Scheuer, Melinda L. (2012). “Supervisor Workplace Stress and Abusive Supervision: The Buffering Effect of Exercise.” Journal of Business and Psychology, 27.3, 271-279. Additional improvements have been noted following workplace health programs in injury incidence, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index, cardiovascular disease risk, dynamic muscle performance, and maximal oxygen consumption.Van Rooy, Kim; Sutherland, Stephanie; Squillace, Mike (2014). “Mayo Clinic’s Mindful Movements in the Workplace.” Health Benefits, 13.White, Karen; Jacques, Paul H. (2007). “Combined diet and Exercise Intervention in the Workplace: Effect on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors.” Workplace Health and Safety, 55.3, 109-114. Some improvements vary by gender, with men often experiencing more consequential improvements in body mass index than women. Workplace health promotion is also known to improve the “perceived health status” of employees, enhancing productivity and improving health program participation. Summarily, the expected outcomes of an ideal workplace health promotion program include: * “Make workers aware of their health and how being in good health improves quality of life.” * “Workers should take ‘ownership’ of their behaviors and be accountable for health and cost outcomes.” * “High participation and active involvement in these programs. People should take advantage of the many programs offered.” * “Employees should lose weight, stop smoking, exercise more often, eat a healthy diet, better manage their stress levels, and generally adopt healthy habits.” * “Medical claims costs should go down. The company should experience a lower incidence of certain diseases linked to behaviors like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), musculoskeletal disorders, and stroke.” * “Workers will be absent less often, disability costs will be controlled, accidents will be avoided, and injury rates should drop sharply.” * “These programs will attract the best talent—and turnover rates will be reduced because we are the employer of choice in the community.” * “Workers will perform at higher levels—they will be happier, have more energy, and produce better results for our company.” * “Establish a culture of health and well-being, where every worker feels valued and important to the enterprise—this will inspire greater loyalty and a high level of engagement.” * “The program will produce a positive return-on-investment (ROI) for the company—for every dollar spent, two or three will be saved.”  See also  *Absenteeism *Body mass index *Booster Breaks *Physical exercise *Presenteeism *Public health *Salutogenesis#Workplace *Sedentary lifestyle *Workplace stress *Workplace wellness References Health promotion Occupational safety and health ","title":"Workplace health promotion"},{"id":"34306237","text":"A one-off is something made or occurring only once, independent of any pattern.

Biography Leo Sarakenopoulos first appears in 971, at the end of the Rus'–Byzantine War of 970–971, when he was appointed by Emperor John I Tzimiskes (r. 969–976) as military governor (strategos) of Dristra/Dorostolon (modern Silistra) on the Danube. Prior to that, Sarakenopoulos had been commander (domestikos) of the elite regiment (tagma) of the Hikanatoi... Sometime before 975, his province was extended and he was also given control over the old Bulgarian capital, Preslav (renamed Ioannopolis by Emperor Tzimiskes). Leo moved his headquarters to Preslav, where a large number of his seals, bearing his full title of \\"protospatharios and strategos of Ioannopolis and Dristra\\" have been discovered.. From this position, Sarakenopoulos oversaw a major programme of fortifications in the Dobruja, to safeguard against another Rus' attack. The long-abandoned Roman forts of the old limes were re-occupied and restored, and new facilities created.cf. . Shortly after 976, when the revolt of the Cometopuli brothers broke out, Sarakenopoulos was given joint command of Ioannopolis with the old theme of Thrace, probably in order to counter the rebellion. In this he failed, and was recalled to Constantinople in circa 979. There, he was raised to the rank of patrikios as a consolation and given the position of Count of the Stable, while at a later date, according to his seals, he also received the post of protostrator..

Life  William Augustus was a son of Duke Otto II of Brunswick-Harburg (1528-1603) from his second marriage with Hedwig (1535-1616), the daughter of the Count Enno II of East Frisia. William Augustus was regarded as extremely learned and, like his father, as a follower of the Lutheran doctrine. In 1575, he became rector of the University of Rostock. He later continued his studies at the University of Leipzig. In 1582, he undertook a Grand Tour to France and England and then enrolled with his brothers at the University of Helmstedt. In 1594, he again went on a journey that took him through Germany, Poland, Switzerland, Italy, Holland, Denmark and Livonia. William Augustus kept a journal about his travels. After the death of his father, he took up the government of Harburg jointly with his brothers Christopher and Otto III. After they died, he ruled alone. In 1618, William Augustus began the construction of the palace at Moisburg. After the death of the Duke Frederick Ulrich of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, he received the County of Hoya from his inheritance. August Wilhelm died unmarried and childless. His inheritance was divided by Dukes of Frederick IV of Brunswick-Celle and Augustus II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.  Ancestors   References  * August B.

She rose to fame with her autobiographical novel Karukku (1992), which chronicles the joys and sorrows experienced by Dalit Christian women in Tamil Nadu. She subsequently wrote two more novels, Sangati (1994) and Vanmam (2002) along with two collections of short stories: Kusumbukkaran (1996) and Oru Tattvum Erumaiyum (2003). In addition to this she has written twenty short stories. Early life & family Bama was born in 1958 as Faustina Mary Fatima Rani in a Roman Catholic family belonging to the Paraiyar community from Puthupatti in the then Madras State. Later she accepted 'Bama' as her pen name. Her father, Susairaj was employed in the Indian Army and her mother was named Sebasthiamma. She is the sister of famous Dalit writer Raj Gauthaman. Bama's grandfather had converted from Hinduism to Christianity. Bama's ancestors were from the Dalit community and worked as agricultural labourers. Bama had her early education in her village. Her early literary influences include Tamil writers like Jayakantan, Akhilan, Mani, and Parthasarthy. In college, she read and enjoyed Kahlil Gibran and Rabindranath Tagore. On graduation, she became a schoolteacher for very poor girls, following which she served as a nun for seven years. She chose to take the holy orders to escape caste-based discrimination, and also to further her mission of helping in the advancement of poor Dalit girls. Writing career After joining the nunnery, Bama found out that there was a separate training centre for Dalit Catholics. Angered by the poor conditions of the Dalit Catholic training centre, she left the nunnery after seven years. She finished her studies and joined as a teacher at a Catholic Christian school. During her teaching experience, she found out that the Catholic nuns oppressed the Dalit children and teachers. This further added to her disdain towards the convent. This was when she began writing. With the encouragement of a friend, she wrote on her childhood experiences. These experiences formed the basis for her first novel, Karukku published in 1992. Bama wrote the novel in a dialect of Tamil that is unique to her community. She said she faced flak regarding the choice of her language from the members of the upper caste. That's when she decided to use the same dialect in all the novels subsequently. When the novel was published, Bama was ostracised from her village for portraying it in poor light and was not allowed to enter it for the next seven months. Karukku was, however, critically acclaimed and won the Crossword Book Award in 2000. It has since become a textbook in various courses like Marginal Literature, Literature in Translation, Autobiography, Feminist Literature, Subaltern Literature and Dalit Literature, across many universities. Bama followed it with Sangati and Kusumbukkaran. Bama got a loan and set up a school for Dalit children in Uttiramerur. Bama's Karukku has been translated to English and Kusumbukkaran and Sangati to French. Sangati has also been translated to Telugu by Dalit writer and activist Joopaka Subhadra. Bama recently published an essay in Single By Choice: happily unmarried women!, a collection of 13 essays by unmarried women in India talking about their singlehood. In her essay she talks about her choice of being a single professional Dalit woman in India. While she did grow up with dreams of marrying a man and having a girl child, she gradually chose being a single woman because according to her \\"the institution and structure of marriage and family as they exist today, are not woman-friendly at all.\\" She also says, \\"I liked being myself; I didn’t want to lose my self, my being, my freedom and identity, for anyone.\\" However, her life choices have been without its own set of challenges. She talks about how she has had to experience insults and suspicion for choosing to be single. Themes Bama 's novels focus on caste and gender discrimination. They portray caste-discrimination practised in Christianity and Hinduism. Bama's works are seen as embodying Dalit feminism and are famed for celebrating the inner strength of the subaltern woman. In an interview, Bama has said that she writes because she considers it her duty and responsibility to share the experiences of her people. In addition, she also finds the act of writing cathartic and liberating. For her, \\"writing itself is a political act\\", and a \\"weapon\\" that she uses to continuously fight against the dehumanizing caste practice.

From 1927 to 1929, Darmour also produced the Toots and Casper series, co-starring Thelma Hill and Bud Duncan. Rooney's popularity provided a base for Darmour to expand into short subjects featuring Karl Dane, Alberta Vaughn, Louise Fazenda, and others, and eventually into low-budget features, using owned studio space at 5821 Santa Monica Boulevard.Poverty Row Studios, 1929-1940: An Illustrated History of 55 Independent Film Companies, with a Filmography for Each, page 223 The company's first feature was Sea Devils (1931), starring Molly O'Day.

Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). Political career Ganesan contested the presidential election for the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee in 1946 but lost to K. Kamaraj. Following a disagreement with Jawaharlal Nehru socialist policies, Rajaji formed the liberal Swatantra Party in 1959. Ganesan became the one of the founding members of this party. He later he held the post of Madras state president of the party. He won the 1962 Madras State legislative assembly election from the Karaikudi constituency. He was elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Council in 1968.  Contributions to the Tamil language  Tamil Thai Statue, Karaikudi Ganesan was a great admirer of the Tamil language. He took as his mission the popularisation of Kamba Ramayanam, the Tamil version of Ramayana written by Tamil poet Kambar. Ganesan founded the Kamban Kazhagam academy in 1939. In 1940, Ganesan decided to construct a temple to the Tamil language with Tamil Thai (Tamil mother) as the main deity. He commissioned sculptor Vaidyanatha Stapathi to design Tamil Thai as an idol of the goddess and to construct the temple in Karaikudi. Due to financial issues, construction did not begin for several years. The project proceeded with financial support from the Government of Tamil Nadu, and then-Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi laid the foundation stone for the temple in 1975. After the deaths of Ganesan and the sculptor Vaidyanatha, Vaidyanatha's son V. Ganapati Sthapati shouldered the responsibility of completing the temple. The Tamil Thai temple was opened by M. Karunanidhi in 1993. Ganesan delivered a speech on the history of the Tamil language in the second World Tamil Conference in Chennai. Furthermore, he submitted several research papers on Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions. He authored many books, including Pillaiyarpatti Thala Varalaru, a historical book about the Karpaka Vinayakar Temple. In 1980, Justice S. Maharajan honoured Ganesan with the title Kamban Adippodi, which means a devotee of Kamban. Ganesan died on 28 July 1982.

Production \\"Kehidupan\\" was written by Jockie Soerjoprajogo. Ahmad Albar performed the vocals, while Ian Antono was on the guitar, Donny Fattah was on bass, Jockie was on keyboard, and Teddy Sujaya was on drums. Sound Denny MR, writing in Rolling Stone Indonesia, notes that there is a spirit of collaboration between the band members, who had spent the previous seven years pursuing individual projects. Antono's guitar riffs are inspired by heavy metal and rougher than on previous albums, while Jockie's keyboarding is smoother than his last album with the band, Huma di Atas Bukit (House on the Hill; 1976). The bass complements the other instruments, instead of simply setting the beat. The song's arrangement is not as complicated as \\"Anak Adam\\" (\\"Child of Adam\\"), from God Bless' second album Cermin (Mirror; 1981), which had been written while Jockie was on hiatus from the band. The lyrics are multi-interpretable. Release and reception \\"Kehidupan\\" was released on God Bless' third album, Semut Hitam (Black Ants), in 1988 through Loggis Records. According to Jockie, it is one of their most successful and recognisable singles; Jodhi Yudono of Kompas writes that it was a smash hit. The song was selected as the 8th-best Indonesian song of all time by Rolling Stone Indonesia in December 2009. In his review, Denny MR noted that while he was a judge in a traveling song festival in February 2009, in Makassar, South Sulawesi, high-school students who had not been born when the song was released had memorized it and performed it at the festival; when he asked them why they had chosen the song, they said that their parents had played it and they had enjoyed it. He suggested that the simple melody and hard rock chords had influenced its staying power. Controversy After having a falling out with God Bless in 2003, Jockie refused to allow the band to play his compositions, including \\"Kehidupan\\"; this extended to including performances on video recordings of the band, such as at the 2010 Djakarta Artmosphere festival. In October 2011, along with information about why he left the band, he posted on his Facebook wall that the band owed him royalties for continuing to use his work.

He settled in England and became a Tory Member of Parliament. Early life His parents were Lawrence Bengston Bancks of Stockholm, commissioner of customs, and his wife Christina.John Burke, A genealogical and heraldic history of the commoners of Great Britain and Ireland enjoying territorial possessions or high official rank: but uninvested with heritable honours, Volume 2 (1835), p. 405; Internet Archive.

The resident's name, Johan Barckman (Hans Barikman) Leijonberg,historyofparliamentonline.org, Members of Foreign Extraction. is usually Anglicised as James Barkman Leyenburg; it is also given as John Birkman, Count of Lezenburgh. Naval officer Bancks joined the Royal Navy in 1681. In 1690 he served at the Battle of Beachy Head, taking over from his wounded captain. Bancks himself had a commission as captain shortly after the battle;James Savage, History of the Hundred of Carhampton: in the county of Somerset, from the best authorities (1830), p. 638; . he commanded HMS Cambridge in September 1690. In the same year he bought Hall Place, Berkshire. As captain of HMS Phoenix in 1692, Bancks was off the coast of Spain when he was driven ashore on 12 April by a superior French naval force. The Phoenix was burnt, to prevent its capture.William Laird Clowes et al., The Royal Navy, a history from the earliest times to the present vol. 2 (1897), p. 468; archive.org. He was captain in HMS Carlisle in 1693. He was on half pay from 1696, or from the conclusion of the Treaty of Ryswick (end 1697). He was knighted in 1698, as captain of HMS Russell, which he had commanded since 1696. In politics He married the widow Mary Luttrell (née Tregonwell) in 1696, and represented Minehead as Member of Parliament from 1698, initially with Alexander Luttrell, brother of Francis, his wife's first husband.historyofparliamentonline.org, Minehead Borough. He was subsequently involved in the rougher side of the Whig-Tory factional strife. Bancks had George Rooke as stepson for a short period, since Rooke's second wife was Mary Luttrell (died 1702), daughter of his wife by her first marriage. Bancks, Rooke and some others belonged to a gentleman's club, for which commemorative medals were struck in 1703 by the visiting Swedish medallist, Bengt Richter; another member who was an M.P. was Tanfield Vachell. A legal case resulted from the connection. After a quarrel with Rooke, William Colepeper claimed that an attempt, on behalf of Rooke, was made upon his life. He had been assaulted at Windsor Castle in July 1703, by Bancks in particular, on the occasion of Colepeper's delivering a petition for Daniel Defoe who was imprisoned.Philip Nicholas Furbank, W. R. Owens, Defoe De-attributions: a critique of J. R. Moore's Checklist (1994), p. 19; Google Books. After a trial before Lord-justice Sir John Holt, 14 February 1704, some persons associated with Rooke were fined for attempts to do Colepeper injury: Nathaniel Denew, John Merriam and Robert Britton.historyofparliamentonline.org, page on George Rooke. Later in 1704 Bancks was allowed the assistance of Sir Simon Harcourt the Solicitor-General to prepare against a case brought by Colepeper.C. S. Knighton, C. Dimmer (editors), Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Anne, Preserved in the National Archives, 1704–1705 (2005), p. 47; Google Books. In 1711 Bancks was attacked in an open letter, initially published anonymously, by the Whig publicist William Benson. It was provoked by an address the year before by Bancks to the borough, commending the doctrine of passive obedience over Whig resistance theory. Benson aimed to associate the \\"Minehead doctrine\\" he attributed to Bancks with the absolutism of Charles XII of Sweden.Simon Varey (editor), The Case of Opposition Stated, between the Craftsman and the People by William Arnall (2003 edition), p. 75 note 45.4–5; Google Books. He followed it with another such letter. In 1713 Benson and James Milner of London stood against Bancks and Sir John Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet in Minehead. The Tory pair won the borough, but Bancks did not stand again. Jacobite Bancks was implicated in the \\"Gyllenberg Plot\\", a Jacobite conspiracy in 1716–7 set up by Carl Gyllenborg and Georg Heinrich von Görtz. He was taken into custody, with Charles Caesar, on 29 January 1717, the day on which General George Wade implicated Gyllenborg in plotting by finding incriminating papers.John Joseph Murray, George I, the Baltic and the Whig split of 1717: a study in propaganda (1969), pp. 315–6; Google Books. Another arrest was Boyle Smith. Bancks and Caesar had in fact raised and sent to Sweden £18,000 to support a putative Jacobite invasion; but there was little intention in Sweden of spending it for that purpose.Linda Colley,In Defiance of Oligarchy: The Tory party 1714–60 (1985), p. 190.

It is an annual species which prefers sandy soils without lime. It is widespread throughout its native Europe and as an introduction in America and elsewhere. Description Papaver dubium is a variable annual, growing to about 60 cm in height. It generally flowers in late spring to mid- summer. The flower is large (30-70mm) and showy, with four petals that are lighter red than in the similar Papaver rhoeas, and most commonly without a black spot at the base. The flower stem is usually covered with coarse hairs that are closely appressed to the surface, helping to distinguish it from P. rhoeas in which the hairs are more usually patent, held at right angles to the stem. The capsules are hairless, elongated to more than twice as tall as they are wide, tapering slightly at the tip, with a stigma generally less wide than the capsule. The plant exudes white to yellowish latex when the tissues are broken. The species can form a long-lived soil seed bank that can germinate when the soil is disturbed. A nearly black-flowering hybrid, known as Evelina, was bred in Italy in the late 1990s, with Papaver rhoeas, but does not appear to be available commercially.

All engines were case-reed valve, air-cooled, two-stroke and single-cylinder with plain steel bores. Lubrication was provided via 20:1 pre-mix. These were directly related to the Suzuki RM series (Racing Model) range of motocross racers. Background During the 1970s, Suzuki had become the first Japanese producer to win a World Motocross Championship, and swept many events via the riding of stars such as Joel Robert, Roger DeCoster, Sylvain Geboers, Gaston Rahier and Gerrit Wolsink on their RH and RN series factory racers.Suzuki. Jeff Clew, 1980, Suzuki Two-Strokes.

Jeff Clew, 1980, This was recognised and within two years, replaced by the much improved RM Series machines. These became extremely popular. The direct transfer of the works Grand Prix developments into the RM Series combined for major success in the market.Suzuki. Jeff Clew, 1980, Creation of the PE In the specialised Enduro field, the USA market was dominated by machines by Penton (KTM), Rokon, Husqvarna, Maico, CZ, Can-Am and others. Suzuki saw this as an area in which they could compete. In 1975, Tosh Koyama and T. Shigenoya at US Suzuki asked John Morgan to provide the factory with information about Enduros and Enduro motorcycles. He then met with a group of Suzuki's factory engineers to discuss in detail. Suzuki were also working with Graham Beamish (their UK importer), and in Autumn of 1975,Motor Cycle Mechanics, December 1976Cycle Illustrated, January 1977 undertook to take the upcoming 1977 RM250B motocrosser and add the appropriate engine, lighting and suspension changes to allow this motocross racer to run over short stretches of public roads during enduros. This was a keenly priced, well performing machine for the period. The British Trophy team entered 3 of the new PE250B into the Austrian ISDT of September 1976 and carried off 3 gold medals, despite repeated stops to allow the machines to cool.Motor Cycle Mechanics December 1976REVS, November 1976 The initial 1977 PE250B proved rugged, well made and docile. The engine was effectively the 5-speed RM series motocross engine, with altered gearing, porting and a heavier flywheel, which produced only 28HP but had broader power and outstanding torque. This proved highly competitive and popular in all countries.Cycle Guide, October 1977Cycle, March 1977Dirt Bike, March 1977 Suzuki PE 250 B le canari (1) Models The following year, 1978, the decision was made to widen the model range and the PE175C was released. This was again based upon an RM Series machine (the RM125) with appropriate alterations. The PE250C continued its development and had many small but effective improvements. The PE175C was built upon the RM125A frame and 6-speed RM125C components, along with the \\"A\\" softer suspension. Lighting and speedometer were provided courtesy of TS Trail/street machines. All PE's until the PE175Z had 36mm forks common across each model year with damping and spring-rate changes to suit. This new PE175C was keenly priced and proved immensely popular.Cycle, September 1978 1978 SUZUKI PE 175 C 1979 saw detail/evolution changes but nothing ground-breaking on the machines. 1979 PE175N SUZUKI PE 250 N 1980 saw the further widening of the range, with the introduction of the PE400T. This was unusual in that the 397cc (85mm x 70mm) 5-speed engine was specifically designed for the PE Series and did not leverage the contemporary RM400 motocross engine. The 400 engine was deliberately designed as an enlarged RM250 and including primary kick. This was instigated by John Morgan of Team Suzuki in the USA.Australian Dirt Bike, July/August 1981 1980 SUZUKI PE 400 T 1980 SUZUKI PE 250 T It shares mounting points and some components with the PE250 engine. In addition, 1980 saw the introduction of major advancements and refinements carried over from the RM machines, such as the alloy swing-arm, better suspension, many engine improvements and the addition of a superb quick-change rear wheel. This created a very successful range of machines covering the PE175, PE250 and PE400. 1981 saw the 175, 250 and 400 being successful and popular, with limited development. The PE250X had many minor changes, but while changes were still occurring, these were not ground-breaking or major. 1981 was the last full-range year for most countries and with the focus of Suzuki moving to cleaner 4-stroke engines for the majority of their new machines and range. Effectively, 1981 became the peak year. By 1982, clearly, the PE Series was now seriously lacking on-going development. Suzuki was changing its focus, pulling out of serious enduro competition and the Pure Enduro range was being curtailed. 1982 (model \\"Z\\") was the last year where all three models could be purchased and even then the 250 and 400 machines were only available in small numbers, in a small number of countries. (Mainly the UK, Australia, Canada). The larger model Z's (250/400) had a handful of minor changes but could not be described as notable improvements over the previous \\"X\\" series machines. The PE175Z and PE175D however continued to evolve, and took advantage of the new RM125 mono-shock 'Full-Floater' system to produce an outstandingly well- handling enduro machine, albeit with lack of on-going engine development. The PE175D was the \\"Z\\" with altered gearing. This meant it was easier for the novice, compared to an \\"A-Grade\\" rider, but the PE was now slower and undeveloped in comparison to the 200cc machines becoming available from other manufacturers.Dirt Rider, July 1983 In 1984, the last PE machine was released, the PE175E. This was effectively a run-out of the remaining machines, with minor changes. There was never a production PE125 machine; though a lightweight (87.5 kg) prototype PE125 was raced by Dwight Rudder on the ISDT team in 1981 at Elba, Italy. Road legality In various countries the laws mandated that road-registered machines have lights/horn/blinkers/stop lights/mirrors in various permutations. In some countries this led to unusually large rear tail-light assemblies and round red reflex safety reflectors on some models, as Suzuki ensured their compliance with local design rules. All PE's came fitted with effective mufflers, with restrictors and double-walled expansion chambers (with mesh) to meet noise and spark restrictor laws where applicable. The USA machines usually came standard with a trip-meter and minimal AC lighting, with a speedometer as an option, whereas PE's in Australia and Belgium (for example) had speedometers, stop lights, horn, 6V DC battery and charging system to suit, by law. The UK machines did not have indicators or battery; however these did come with an AC horn. The lighting requirements varied across years and countries, so a PE in the UK, South Africa or France might have substantially different rear tail-lights and mounting assemblies to those in the USA. The French PE's (for example) continued to use the PE250B style headlamp shell, with a parking light and a yellow globe insert, due to local regulations. Also some countries (UK for example) required an alloy fuel tank rather than plastic, which is almost identical to the PE250B tank, but with altered front mounting-strap tabs. The capacity of the plastic fuel tanks varied from 12litres to 10.6litres on various models, without any obvious visual differences, possibly due to mould thickness. Suzuki usually supplied the PE with one of three different brands of tyre depending on local requirements. The standard tyre was the IRC, however some years and countries saw other brands such as Bridgestone or Dunlop fitted (run at 5-11PSI). Competition Suzuki were committed to international enduro racing from 1976 until they pulled out in 1982. 1981 PE 175 X In the UK, Graham Beamish and his staff worked out the characteristics for the ideal enduro machine and sent them to Japan during the winter of 1975. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, in 1975 US Suzuki requested John Morgan (who had been campaigning a modified TS250 with great success) to select three additional riders and compete in four National Enduros that year. Then in 1976, they continued to develop the PE250 and competed in a number of events with just one rider, Teddy Worrell, who did quite well. The next year, 1977, was the start of Team Suzuki, which competed in National Enduros and IDSE Qualifiers and the US team went to the ISDT in Czechoslovakia (widely considered one of the toughest ISDT events ever) with three riders comprising Teddy Worrell, Dave Hulse and Bruce Kenny. This left John Morgan and mechanic Aki Goto to address DNF's due to ring seizures on all three machines.Motorcyclist, December 1977 The competition development of the PE drew heavily upon the American test team and the factory put a lot of trust in the development riders and their recommendations - much of which found its way into the production machines. For example, R&D; for the first generation PE175 was one task of Drew Smith and Mike Rosso. Herluf Johnson, Ted Worrell and Gus Blakely all played major parts in development. Drew Smith, for example, made most of the pipes for all the Team Suzuki bikes. The team generally used Works Performance shock-absorbers, while working with the major Japanese companies, Kayaba and Showa, trying to develop an improved shock-absorber design. At the peak there were 16 riders representing Team Suzuki in the US. Some were National Enduro and some were ISDE - some were both.Luke Brennan, personal correspondence with John Morgan and Drew Smith A selection of well-known enduro racersTeam Suzuki 1980, Booklet published by Suzuki News Bureau, US Suzuki Motor Corp from that period were: *British Trophy Team riders Ted Thompson, Ernie Page and Brian Higgins all rode PE250B's to Gold in 1976 (Zeltweg, Austria).Motorcycle Mechanics, December 1976Trail & Track, December 1976 *Tom Penton, who scored his sixth ISDT Gold when he competed in his final event (High Chaparral, Sweden) in 1978, riding a factory Suzuki PE175 entry. *Don Cichocki, Mike Rosso and Dave Hulse all earned Gold on the new PE175's at Sweden. *Gary Edmond attained Gold at Sweden in the 350cc class, riding a special enlarged PE250 - a precursor to the later PE400.Cycle World, January 1979 *Jeff Fredette was recruited by Suzuki in 1979 and raced aboard a PE250.

This resulted in the RS175 and RS250 being released in 1980 and 1981. These had detuned PE engines (milder porting and smaller carburettors), softer suspension, RM125N frame geometry, steel (RM100T) swing-arm, DS series lighting and a small RM fuel tank, DR400 forks. Components were drawn from a variety of older model parts bins.Cycle, July 1980Dirt Bike, September 1980Dirt Bike, July 1982Cycle Guide, December 1980 Quick-change rear wheel The 1979 'N' series machines introduced a slotted section at the rear of the swing-arm, to allow the wheel, with axle, to be withdrawn. There were two bolts behind the axle to undo and remove, then take the brake cable nut and slip off the chain. The rear wheel then slipped out to the rear. The snail-cam adjusters made the re-installation and tensioning of the chain a far faster task than on the earlier models.Cycle Magazine, April 1979 For the 1980 'T' range, Suzuki developed a much improved system that was widely praised for its intelligent design. You simply lay the machine on its left side, remove the axle, slip out a spacer and lift the wheel away from the cush-drive, without disturbing the chain or rear brake. Re-installation involved engaging the wheel hub to the brake drum/sprocket carrier, sliding in the one long spacer on the right side of the wheel, and then installing and tightening the axle.Motorcyclist, August 1980 References PE series Motorcycle racing Dirt biking Off-road motorcycles Two-stroke motorcycles ","title":"Suzuki PE series"},{"id":"34306818","text":"Jorge Abad Airport (Filipino: Paliparang Jorge Abad, Ilocano: Pagtayaban ti Jorge Abad), also known as Itbayat Airport, is an airport serving the island of Itbayat, the largest island in the province of Batanes, Philippines.

The airport is classified as a community airport by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), a body of the Department of Transportation that is responsible for the operations of not only this airport but also of all other airports in the Philippines except the major international airports. The northernmost airport in the Philippines was renamed in March 2017 through a Sangguniang Bayan (municipal council) resolution after Jorge Abad, the first Ivatan cabinet member who was appointed in 1955 as Secretary of Public Works. His son, Florencio Abad, was instrumental in sourcing the funds for the airport construction during his time as congressional representative for Batanes.

Background  The village of Burunga is situated near Osmaninagar in Sylhet District of present-day Bangladesh. On the afternoon of 25 May, tension mounted in Burunga and nearby villages over the arrival of Pakistani soldiers. At 4 pm they met local union chairman Injad Ali. After the meeting, it was announced by the beating of drums in Burunga and other nearby villages that on the morning of 26 May, a peace committee would be formed and 'peace cards' would be distributed from the grounds of Burunga High School.  Killings  In spite of fear, the residents of Burunga and nearby villages began to assemble at the Burunga High School grounds from 8 am the next day. More than a thousand people gathered at the school premises. At around 9 am, collaborators Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque arrived in a jeep at the school ground along with a Pakistani army contingent led by Captain Nur Uddin. They tallied the attendance against a list they had with them and felt satisfied. Meanwhile, another group went from door to door in the village and commanded the males to assemble at the school ground. At around 10 am, they segregated the crowd into Hindus and Muslims. The Hindus were herded into the office room and the Muslims were taken into a class room inside the school building. The latter were made to recite the kalma and the Pakistani national anthem and then most of them were let off. The remaining Muslims were asked to tie the Hindus with ropes in batches of four. Some of the Hindus began to cry out of fear. In the meantime, one of the captive Hindus Srinibas Chakraborty had managed to open one of the windows. Priti Ranjan Chowdhury, the Headmaster of the Burunga High School, who was among the captives, along with Ranu Malakar, a Hindu youth, jumped out of the window. The Pakistani army opened fire on them, but they managed to escape. At about noon, the Hindus were brought outside to the grounds from the school building and ninety of them were made to stand in three columns. They were burst fired from three light machine guns, under the command of Captain Nur Uddin. The Pakistani army then poured kerosene over the dead bodies and set them on fire. Ram Ranjan Bhattacharya, a prominent and influential lawyer at the Sylhet Judges Court who too was being held by the Pakistani forces, was let go. As soon as he got up from his chair, he was shot from behind. He died instantaneously. After the massacre, a group of eight to ten collaborators led by Abdul Ahad Chowdhury and Dr. Abdul Khaleque looted the village and molested the womenfolk. On the next day, the Pakistani forces arrived again at Burunga. They hired some labourers with the help of chairman Injad Ali and buried the burnt and half burnt remains of the Hindu corpses in a pit beside the Burunga High School. A few Hindus, including Srinibas Chakraborty, Jitendra Baidya and Adhir Malakar, survived the massacre even after receiving multiple bullet wounds. There is no consensus on the number of the dead, with estimates ranging from 71 to 94. According to survivor Srinibas Chakraborty, 94 persons were killed. However, it is generally accepted that 78 Hindus were killed in the massacre.  Memorial  In 1984, the government of Bangladesh enclosed the mass killing site with a brick wall. Later, a memorial for the victims of the genocide has been raised.

Career Viljoen made his first-class debut for Namibia in the CSA Provincial Three-Day Challenge competition held in South Africa on 21 January 2010 against KwaZulu-Natal. He also made his T20 debut (along with 9 other players in Namibia) against Zimbabwe on 13 February 2010. Opening the bowling with Louis Klazinga, Viljoen took a single wicket (that of Sikandar Raza) for seven runs. He played six matches in the tournament, scoring 61 runs from three innings with a highest of 41, and took six wickets at an average of 16.83. After experimenting with a two-division format the International Cricket Council decided that the 2011–13 ICC Intercontinental Cup would feature eight teams, including Namibia who were previously in the Shield competition, playing first-class cricket. Namibia played their opening fixture of the Cup in September. Batting at number three Viljoen scored a four-ball duck in the first innings but in the second managed 87 from 136 balls, in the process passing 500 first-class runs in his career and beating his previous highest score in the format. A side made up of some of the leading players from Associate and Affiliate teams was put together to face England in Dubai in January 2012. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Along with Craig Williams, Viljoen was one of two Namibia players included in the 12-man squad. Coming in to bat at 90/6, Viljoen top-scored with 98 runs from 189 balls against a bowling line-up including James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, and Graeme Swann. The UAE hosted the 2012 World Twenty20 Qualifier in March. Namibia progressed to the preliminary finals where they lost to Ireland. With 14 wickets from 9 matches, Viljoen was Namibia's leading wicket-taker in the tournament (equal fourth overall), and scored 48 runs from 5 innings. Shortly after the tournament concluded, Namibia hosted Canada in the Intercontinental Cup. Namibia won by eight wickets and in the second innings Viljoen finished with career-best bowling figures of 7/61. In January 2018, he was named in Namibia's squad for the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament. He was the joint-leading wicket-taker for Otago in the 2018–19 Super Smash, with thirteen dismissals in seven matches. In March 2019, he was named in Namibia's squad for the 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament. Namibia finished in the top four places in the tournament, therefore gaining One Day International (ODI) status. Viljoen made his ODI debut for Namibia on 27 April 2019, against Oman, in the tournament's final. In May 2019, he was named in Namibia's squad for the Regional Finals of the 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Africa Qualifier tournament in Uganda. He made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for Namibia against Ghana on 20 May 2019. In Namibia's third match of the tournament, against Botswana, Viljoen took his first five-wicket haul in a T20I match, finishing with figures of five wickets for nine runs from his four overs. He finished as the leading wicket-taker in the Regional Finals, with nine dismissals in three matches. However, following the conclusion of the tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Viljoen for four matches, after he breached the ICC's Anti-Racism Code during the match against Uganda. In June 2019, he was one of twenty-five cricketers to be named in Cricket Namibia's Elite Men's Squad ahead of the 2019–20 international season. In September 2019, he was named in Namibia's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates.

Formerly operated by BP, it is now owned by Euro Garages and was planning to be expanding to incorporate drive-through restaurants with a seating area and a shop. A Starbucks was added with a drive through but the Burger King was not added at the time. History Welcome Break sold the services in 2001, and from 2001-2012 the services were derelict with nothing more than a BP and a Spar. When Euro Garages finally bought the site in 2011, the services were planned to expanded to form a fairly large service area and to expand Euro Garages' network of sites as they only operated one motorway service area at the time. The services were fully built by 2012. In 2013, a Starbucks was added and, at the time, was one of the only Starbucks 'Drive- Thru's in the country. In early 2014, some of the Spar store changed into a Greggs, adding a new facility to the services. In late 2014, parking regulations at the site changed. There was a charge for parking over 2 hours without a ticket. In 2015, there was construction for 6 weeks near the services. Once the construction was finished, there was a pavement alongside the A449 dual carriageway road from the service car park into Ross-on-Wye. By 2016, all parking machines had been removed at the services and customers who wanted to stay for more than 2 hours could let a member of staff know about it with no charge, either at Starbucks or the Spar kiosk. In early 2018, the Starbucks was temporarily open 24 hours, like the Spar. Soon after, as not many people visited between the evening and the morning, the opening times reverted to its old state. In late 2018, the petrol station switched from BP to Esso, after being with BP for nearly 18 years. In late 2019, building work has started at the services between the Spar and the Starbucks. According to staff, it could be a Burger King. Construction Construction of the service station started in 2011 and was finished in mid-2012. The original service area was constructed between 1965-1966. Layout The Service Area consists of two buildings. The first is a Starbucks with outside seating and the second is a Spar with a Subway and a Greggs, that was more recently constructed. Facilities *Greggs; *Subway; *Starbucks; *Spar; *Esso.

Early life and football career Baird was born in Sydney in 1885 and schooled at McDonaldtown School in the inner Sydney suburbs. By 1908 when he was playing rugby league in the code's inaugural competition year, he was located in Brisbane. He was selected in the first ever Queensland Maroons state representative side to play the new \\"Northern Union\\" style of rugby, taking on Albert Baskerville's New Zealand All Golds on their inaugural tour. Baird played as a reserve as the Queenslanders lost the historic match 34–12. He went on to make another appearance against New Zealand and two against New South Wales. When the New Zealand team came back on the return leg of their tour, they played three Test matches against the first Australian representative sides ever selected. The first Test was played in Sydney on 9 May 1908 with the Kiwis prevailing. On 30 May the 2nd Test was played in Brisbane. The side had four new players who had not played in the Sydney test, two of them Queenslanders in George Watson and Baird. Baird made his sole national representative appearance at full-back, becoming Kangaroo No. 15. Charlie Hedley was selected at fullback for the 1st and 3rd Tests of the series. Baird continued to play at fullback for Queensland against a touring New Zealand Māori rugby league team in 1908.

Life  Sophia Hedwig was the eldest child of the Duke Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1528-1589) from his marriage to Hedwig (1540-1602), the daughter of Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg. Her parents provided her with a comprehensive and thorough education and started marriage negotiations when she was young. She married as a 16-year-old on 20 October 1577 in Wolgast to Duke Ernst Ludwig of Pommern-Wolgast (1545-1592). Her father sent Lutheran theologicians to the court at Wolgast, who tried to move the court to accept the Formula of Concord as the authoritative formulation of the Lutheran creed.Heinrich Heppe: Geschichte der lutherischen Concordienformel und Concordie, Elwert, 1858, p. 311 The court did not accept this formula. Ernst Ludwig ordered structural changes to Wolgast Castle, replacing the medieval northeast wing by a new residential wing.Roderich Schmidt: Das historische Pommern, Böhlau Verlag, Cologne and Weimar, 2009, p. 174 Like her mother, Sophia Hedwig was described as high spirited. She took care of the poor and the needy and was not deterred by a plague epidemic.Wilhelm Havemann: Geschichte der Lande Braunschweig und Lüneburg, 1855, p. 418 Online Ernst Ludwig died in 1592, after 15 years of marriage. In addition to her jointure, the castle and district of Loitz, he left her Ludwigsburg estate near Greifswald, which he had already given to her in 1586, and the Jamitsow estate at the Peenestrom. She soon swapped the latter for the Zerpenzyn estate, opposite the city of Loitz.

During her husband's lifetime, Sophia Hedwig had rebuilt the castle at Loitz as a renaissance château. After his death, she embellished it further.Dirk Schleinert, Zur Geschichte des Loitzer Schlosses, in: Dirk Schleinert and Ralf-Gunnar Werlich: Loitz - Stadt an der Peene.

Loitz and Ludwigsburg remained her dowager residences until her death. When the inventory of her court was taken in 1593, an Amtshauptmann was present, as were a treasurer, a comptroller, a Hofmeister, a governess, a lady-in-waiting and several chamber staff, kitchen staff, cellar staff and stable hands.Ute Essegern: Fürstinnen am kursächsischen Hof, Leipziger Universitätsverlag, 2007, p. 45 Sophia Hedwig was described as interested in economic processes, but also as wasteful and overbearing. She is considered one of the more influential duchesses in Pomerania. Her son survived her by nearly six years; he died in the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War. The war delayed her funeral by almost two years. She was buried in the ducal crypt in the St. Peter's Church in Wolgast.

The site of the battle has been identified as Koppal by C.R. Krishnamacharlu and this has been accepted by Sastri and Dr. B.R Gopal. Though the Cholas were successful in the battle, the king and supreme commander, Rajadhiraja I lost his life in the battlefield and was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Rajendra Chola II.  Sources  The main historic sources of the battle are an inscription dated to 1054 and Rajendra Chola's Manimangalam record of 1055.  Causes  Since his accession to the throne, Rajadhiraja Chola desired to subjugate the Chalukyas who ruled over portions of Northern Karnataka and the southern part of present-day Maharashtra and incorporate their territories into the Chola Empire. His first invasion of the Chalukya kingdom in 1047-48 had failed. In 1054, he led a second expedition into the Chalukya territories which met the Chalukya army and fought a battle at place mentioned as \\"Koppam\\".  Events  In 1054, Rajadhiraja led a huge army northward and plundered the province of Rattamandalam. His army was followed in the rear by forces under Rajadhiraja's brother and heir-apparent, Rajendra II. The Chalukya king Someshvara I prepared to meet his enemy and a pitched battle was fought at Koppam. The Chola troops were holding the upper hand when Chalukyan archers shot Rajadhiraja mortally wounding him. The Chola troops panicked and began to retreat when Rajendra II, commanding the reserve forces, personally took command of the army and rallying the Chola forces together, inflicted heavy losses on the Chalukya army forcing Someshvara I to flee. Chola sources record that the elephants, horses and camels of the Chalukyas, along with a huge booty and the queens of Someshvara I fell into the hands of the Cholas. Rajendra II, reportedly, crowned himself on the battlefield and erected a victory pillar at Kolhapur before returning to his country.  Identification of Koppam  The Manimangalam inscription state that Koppam was a city on \\"the Great River\\". Fleet has identified it with Khidrapur, 30 miles south-east of Kolhapur, thereby assuming the \\"Great River\\" to be the Krishna, while other historians have identified Koppam with a place near Maski.

Feist and starring Ruth Roman and Steve Cochran. An ex-convict who thinks he killed a man goes into hiding with a woman whose boyfriend is the supposed murder victim.. Plot Convicted of murder at age 13, Bill Clark is freed after 18 years behind bars. He meets a taxi dancer, Catherine Higgins, but, one evening when she invites him to her apartment, her New York City police detective boyfriend, George Conover, is waiting there. After Conover slaps Catherine, Bill engages him in a fight during which the detective pulls a gun. After a sustained struggle, Bill is knocked out. When he awakens, Conover is gone, Cathy is packing to leave. Soon, through a newspaper article, Bill finds out that Conover was shot and, remembering that he wrestled the gun out of the man's hand, believes he is responsible for the act and knows the police will come after him. He doesn't know that it was Catherine who shot her boyfriend. Bill follows Cathy to her brother's house and she leads him to believe he is guilty of the shooting. Realizing that they both are in trouble, they hitch- hike to California, falling in love along the way. They accompany the Dawson family to the lettuce fields of Salinas, where they find honest work and happiness, changing their identities. A reporter's article about Clark is found by the Dawsons who, after they are visited by a tragic event, need money badly and turn in Bill for a reward. But back in New York, police reveal that before Conover died, he confessed that Catherine shot him in self-defense. She and Bill are cleared to resume their lives.

Krueger co-created the annual convention with a group of San Diego friends, including Shel Dorf, Richard Alf and Mike Towry. Biography Kenneth J. Krueger, Jr. was born in upstate New York. Krueger was a Buffalo, New York, based member and co-founder of the Buffalo Fantasy League, Bohemia Club, and publisher of the semi-pro Pegasus Publications—most noted for the first appearance of science fiction writer Wilson Tucker’s Prison Planet in Space Trails (Pegasus Publications, Summer 1947). Krueger later founded Shroud: Publishers, Kenneth J. Krueger: Publisher, Valcour-Krueger, and Fantasy House.Over My Shoulder by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Oswald Train: Publisher, 1983, page 169. Krueger was also an inspiration and focal point for an ambitious group of young comic book fans who planned and hosted the event that became San Diego Comic-Con International, serving as Chairman of the group’s first multi-day event, the San Diego Golden State Comic-Con held August 1–3, 1970. Early Science Fiction Fan Activity Krueger began writing letters to science fiction magazines in 1938, at the age of eleven, and was an attendee of the very first “scientifiction” convention held in 1939, officially making him a member of the elite-if-obscure group known as First Fandom.“The Greatest Unsung Hero of Fandom: Kenneth J. Krueger, Jr.” by Earl Terry Kemp, VFW 100, September 4, 2007 As a resident of the New York area, he attended the first World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) on July 2–4, 1939, at age twelve, in New York City, the first science fiction convention ever held. Already an ardent science fiction fan, by age seventeen Krueger was also a member of the Slan Shack crowd (along with a very young Frank M. Robinson, Jr.).“Who is Ken Krueger, Jr.? by Earl Terry Kemp, a biography for the San Diego Comic Fest, October 17, 2012 The Slan Shack, which first appeared at the end of October 1943, was where a batch of active Battle Creek, Michigan, science fiction fans lived for nearly two years. Here dwelt the Ashley's, Walt Liebscher, and Jack Weidenbeck, and later noted science fiction author E. Everett Evans. They all moved en masse on September 7, 1945, to another site on Bixel Street, Los Angeles, cheek by jowl with the LASFS (Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society) clubroom. (It was the ground floor of a duplex next door. Its upper floor, “Slan Shack Annex”, was rented occasionally to struggling fen and pros.) The place didn't break up till the building was torn down in March 1948 to make room for an office building.All Our Yesterdays by Harry Warner Jr., Advent:Publishers, Inc., 1969 The original Battle Creek Slan Shack opened on October 30, 1943, when the Ashley's bought the eight-room house at 25 Popular Street, and simultaneously held the first Michicon. The fourth Michicon was held at Slan Shack from June 17 to 19, 1944. While in attendance, the young Ziff-Davis office boy, Frank Robinson, showed extreme valor by publishing two issues of Fanewscard during the con. Some 23 fans were there, including travelers Lynn Bridges, of Florida, and a seventeen-year-old Ken Krueger of Buffalo. Frank Robinson, in his memoir, Not So Good a Gay Man (TOR, 2017), writes of \\"having a crush\\" on his friend, Ken Krueger, and almost making a pass at him during the Michicon.Not So Good a Gay Man by Frank Robinson, TOR, 2017, page 29. In the fall of 1944, over Labor Day weekend, Krueger hosted the first BuffaloCon, in his mother's house. In attendance were Don Wollheim and Elsia Balter (later Mrs. Wollheim), Damon Knight, and Larry Shaw. Oliver “Ollie” Saari of Flint, Michigan, a mechanical engineer working for GM, was there. As well as Frank Robinson, all the way from Chicago.Mimosa 22, “The Legendary Slan Shack,” Delvin Coger Krueger began editing his first science fiction fanzine, Abortions, in 1952. Science fiction writer Rog Phillips reviewed the first issue in his The Club House column in the February 1952 issue of Amazing Stories.Amazing Stories February 1952, page 142.Rog Phillips’ The Club House, by Rog Phillips, The Last Stand, 2014, page 261. Not content with editing his own fanzine, Krueger was a regular contributor to the Buffalo Fantasy League's official club fanzine, Hyperopia, which was edited by fellow club member, Robert J. Fritz. Even as far back as July 1952, when the first issue of Hyperopia appeared, readers knew Ken Krueger and held him in very high regard. In 1952 Krueger was nominated and elected as Progressive Fandom's candidate to the post of president of the National Fantasy Fan Federation. Alas, in his self-effacing manner, he declined the nomination. Ken Krueger, Publisher The Buffalo Book Company In 1945 Grant-Hadley Enterprises published its first, and only, modest effort. It wasn't a book; rather it was a 26-page pamphlet. Rhode Island on Lovecraft consisted of five articles on H.P. Lovecraft by Rhode Islanders who had been associated with the writer during his lifetime. Two editions of this title were printed.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 340. Meeting in a well- known Providence, Rhode Island landmark, Dana's Old Corner Bookstore, the two science fiction fans decided to publish a small volume about Lovecraft. After all, the Old Corner Bookstore had purchased H.P. Lovecraft's library from his estate, so what better place, and subject to begin publishing. The two partners, Donald M. Grant and Thomas G. Hadley, having been bit by the publishing bug, moved on to their next reincarnation as The Buffalo Book Company, with the addition of yet another partner, Kenneth J. Krueger, Jr. The two initial partners, Grant and Hadley, knew from their dismal experience producing and struggling to distribute the Lovecraft pamphlet that they would have problems distributing any new titles or any new books. Distribution is the key to any publishing effort, and the two had already failed at it and knew it. The two men had some ideas about book design, but not what to publish or how to make money from it. As their business plan expanded they sought the help of Ken Krueger, bringing him on board as the third partner for their newly planned, but not yet started, publishing company.“The Greatest Unsung Hero of Fandom: Kenneth J. Krueger, Jr.” by Earl Terry Kemp, Vegas Fandom Weekly, VFW 100, September 4, 2007 Krueger, at the age of twenty-one, was already recognized as a super-salesman. He knew how to distribute books. He always did.“The Greatest Unsung Hero of Fandom: Kenneth J. Krueger, Jr.” by Earl Terry Kemp, Vegas Fandom Weekly, VFW 100, September 4, 2007 This was the final key, and the three were ready to begin. The key to turning all their ideas from dreams to reality lay in Krueger's extensive mailing list from his successful mail-order book distribution business. With Krueger as the final partner the three men were ready to form The Buffalo Book Company and make some real money. In 1945, The Buffalo Book Company was formed by Donald M. Grant, Thomas G. Hadley of Providence, Rhode Island, and Kenneth J. Krueger, who lived in Buffalo, New York (hence the name). Krueger even designed their distinctive colophon.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 341. First, The Buffalo Book Company produced the noteworthy hardbound edition of The Time Stream, by John Taine. The book was quite professional in appearance, awakening hopes of a line of the best novels from science fiction magazines appearing in permanent form. The success of their first title was enough to encourage the three to go on to another book, the first book publication of The Skylark of Space, by E.E. Smith. Due to the publisher, Ken Krueger, and his successful efforts in advertising and distributing the book, it was an instant sell-out. By the time the third title was in the works, Don Grant was in the military. Krueger, as always the super- salesman, had plans for the company, but still in the military as well, was unable to become involved full-time. Without Grant's involvement, Krueger continued his struggle part-time to make the business a success despite Hadley's resistance; help was found in an unexpected quarter. Lloyd Arthur Eshbach contributed a few ideas on how to appeal to the science fiction fan base by placing advertisements in the major magazines.Over My Shoulder by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, pages 109-111, & 165. Grant continued in the military, went on to college after he was discharged, and in 1949 started The Grandon Company; still hooked on publishing science fiction and fantasy.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 342. With Krueger unable to prevent it, Tom Hadley transformed the business once again. Using substantial financial contributions from his family (Hadley thought he didn't need any partners) Hadley tried to go it alone with The Hadley Publishing Co. Hadley used the distribution list and model created by Krueger, and the tips from Eshbach, as well as the various titles of forthcoming works that had once been scheduled for the now defunct Buffalo Book Company to begin. But when the ideas were used up, so was the company. Eshbach, having whetted himself in the publishing field, went on to found Fantasy Press, once again taking Krueger's extensive mailing list as a building block. Eshbach had several partners to begin with, but was clearly the leading force, and as his partners disappeared from the scene, one after the other, Eshbach carried on alone. Eshbach saw the potential use of Krueger's distribution list, made a copy, and used it as the basis of his subscription, special order, limited signed copy offer of his list of 47 titles. Thus was born Fantasy Press, one of the most successful and honored small presses, and highly collectible, despite the fact that Eshbach overextended himself and went bankrupt. Much later, Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, in his autobiographical account, as given in his memoir Over My Shoulder, disingenuously stated that he could not get a clear picture of Krueger's contributions to the publishing field and did not find anything of importance that Krueger contributed to the genre.Over My Shoulder by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Oswald Train: Publisher, 1983, page 169. As far as The Buffalo Book Company and its efforts, The Skylark of Space, by E.E. Smith, in collaboration with Lee Hawkins Garby, was plagued with the obvious signs of the beginning writer on the part of all concerned. Doc Smith later told how he collaborated with his neighbor's wife, Lee Hawkins Garby, for help writing scenes involving women. Later he would drop all reference to her help in subsequent reprints of this title. The publisher's name doesn't appear on the copyright page. The front of the book is stamped in a hand-lettered logotype and in the same logo at the base of the spine. Krueger even designed the logo for the company. Allan Halladay, the printer of the book, designed the jacket. However, with all these flaws, and contributions, it was Skylark in book form. Without Ken Krueger, it would never have been published. He was the driving force behind this publication. His everlasting fingerprints are all over this title. Ken Krueger is one of the unsung heroes of science fiction and fandom. Yet he is not even mentioned in Advent:Publishers, Hugo Award winning, The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy. Krueger's persistence of vision is truly amazing; he never licked the publishing bug. Out of the service, he started Shroud: Publishers, then Kenneth J. Krueger: Publisher, as well as a couple of other smaller semi-pro publications such as Valcour-Krueger, Fantasy House, and Pegasus Publications. Shroud: Publishers Shroud: Publishers, begun in 1954, was financed, in the beginning at least, by one Robert J. Fritz, a friend and fellow member of the Buffalo Fantasy League. Kenneth J. Krueger was editor-in-chief, and became so identified with Shroud that few people even remember R.J. Fritz. The press was also associated with a paperback publisher, SSR (Snappy Space Rocket) Publications (including early works by one of the original five Advent:Publishers founders Robert Briney writing as Don Duane). All of it—Shroud and SSR—passed finally to Ken Krueger, who retained the back stock, the copyrights, and the Shroud name as a series title.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 354. Under the Shroud imprint, Krueger published such titles as: The Maker of Moons, by Robert W. Chambers (1954); Look Behind You, by Arthur J. Banks (1954); The Female Demon, by William McDougle (1955); and perhaps his best-known publication, The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath, by H.P. Lovecraft (1955); which was followed by one of his least-known titles, The Motive Key, by Jack Woodford (1956).The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, pages 354-361. Of some small note: The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath as published by Shroud was the very first appearance of this title in hardcover. August Derleth had published the story for the first time in his periodical, Arkham Sampler (Winter 1948 issue) under his Arkham House imprint. Krueger, with his Shroud imprint published the first separate appearance and the first hardcover of this title. It is the most elusive and costly of all Lovecraft's printed works, equal to if not exceeding even The Outsider and Others, the first hardcover title published by Arkham House.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 358. Kenneth J. Krueger: Publishers Kenneth J. Krueger used his own name for his next publishing operation (1958-1965) after Shroud had lapsed; even though Krueger kept selling his leftover copies as well as being a general book dealer.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, page 363. Under the Kenneth J. Krueger imprint, Krueger published such notable classic titles from the early predawn era of science fiction and horror literature as: The Moon Maker, by Arthur Train and Robert Wood (1958); and what is undoubtedly the very best, now long forgotten, horror story ever written, The Fearsome Island, by Albert Kinross (1965).The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, pages 363-364. Shroud Returns After a time he decided to publish again, retaining the Shroud name as a series title. For his return to the Shroud imprint, Ken choose to publish a memorial tribute to his best friend and mentor, fellow member of First Fandom and fellow resident of the famous Slan Shack, E. Everett Evans. Food for Demons (1971) consisted of story selections and “appreciations” from Doc Smith, Mel Hunter, Forrest J Ackerman, A.E. van Vogt, Ray Bradbury, Walter J. Daugherty, Henry M. Eichner, Walt Leibscher, and of course, one by Ken Krueger.The Anthem Series by Earl Terry Kemp, The Last Stand, 2012, pages 361-362. Food for Demons (Shroud: Publishers, San Diego, CA, 1971, 154 pp., $3.95) was printed for Ken Krueger by Donald M. Grant in 1959, but not bound until 1969. The cover was done in 1970. Some are hand-colored by either Henry M. Eichner or Krueger. The “true” hardcovers (13 issued to contributors and friends) reflect the original New York address of Shroud. However, all of the paper copies reflect Krueger's mid-1960s move to San Diego. The San Diego Comic Con By 1968 Krueger had relocated to San Diego, and partnered with a local pulp collector, John Hull, to open a bookstore in Ocean Beach, California. John Hull, who lived in Chula Vista, was a neighbor of Greg Bear, and let the precocious teen have the run of his garage-stored science fiction collection, thus bringing Bear into fandom. The two would supplement their book sales by reselling pornography lifted from the Greenleaf Classics stock by Earl Kemp, and sold to them at a discount. Greg Bear, Mike Towry, along with comic artist Scott Shaw, and other friends, formed their own science fiction fan club, “The ProFanests” and hung out at Krueger's flyblown establishment, discussing the latest batch of “Ace Doubles” with the walk-in locals who frequented the place. On August 1–3, 1970, Ken Krueger hosted the first local comic book convention. The first San Diego Golden State Comic Convention, held in the basement of the U.S. Grant Hotel. The Con, for its day, was a rousing success. The U.S. Grant Hotel was not the snazziest of venues, but it was the only one in town willing to risk hosting an event that would garner such a low bar-attendance. Ken Krueger was instrumental with founding the event. Krueger invited his long time friend from science fiction fandom, Earl Kemp, Vice President of Greenleaf Classics, to speak at the Con. Earl Kemp followed San Diego Evening Tribune editorial cartoonist Bob Stevens onto the podium. For the rest of his life Krueger worked as a publisher, editor, and distributor for the comic and sci-fi industries. He published and released the first works of several science fiction and comic authors, including Greg Bear, Scott Shaw, Dave Stevens, and Jim Valentino. In 2009, Valentino called Krueger \\"my mentor\\". After the Con Krueger moved to Buffalo, New York, in 2002. Retired, but not quite done, Krueger continued to attend the local Buffalo-area pulp and comic conventions with his lifelong pal, and fellow co-founder of Pegasus Publications and the Buffalo Fantasy League, Paul Ganly. Krueger and other co-founders were honored for their contributions by the San Diego Comic-Con International in 2009. Krueger died of a heart attack on November 21, 2009 in Lockport, New York at age 83, eighteen days after the passing of fellow Comic-Con founder Shel Dorf. Krueger was survived by his eight children.

In prison in Naples where he is serving time for a robbery charge, he is sprung by accident when a foppish villain calling himself the Baron (Pinuccio Ardia) and his two \\"numb-skull\\" cohorts, Agonia (Ugo Fangareggi) and the Captain (Dante Maggio), tunnel under his cell, having lost their way to an expected bank vault. Napoleon escapes with his rescuers through the tunnel, and upon arrival on the outside of the prison, he discovers that the three are flat broke, despite the well-dressed appearance of the Baron. Napoleon swiftly asserts himself as leader of the group by pretending to be a master criminal and suggests that they move to Rome for richer pickings. The four of them are forced to travel to Rome in the back of a cattle truck since they do not have a car. On the outskirts of Rome, the gang falls in with a seedy crook and gigolo who called himself Il Cajella (Jean-Claude Brialy), who owns a dilapidated used-car lot which Napoleon elects as his gang's hide-out and Cajella as their co-conspirator/protector. At first, Napoleon's renewed criminal activates are unambitious and he is soon caught stealing a woman's purse at a local shopping center. Before the security guards can call the police, Marisa (Christine Barclay) the woman whose purse he'd stolen comes, forward the announces that she knows him and saves him from arrest. Marisa insists on calling Napoleon \\"Filiberto\\", as it turns out merely because he resembles her dead husband. Meanwhile, Cajella encounters the beautiful Samantha (Uta Levka) while cruising for trade at a singles bar mainly populated by wealthy older women. Cajella is unaware that Samantha belongs to a big American criminal named Joe Ventura (Edward G. Robinson). Elsewhere, the increasingly starved gang of crooks attempt to raise money to buy food by conning American tourists by offering them a private view of Michaelangelo's famous Pieta which is currently shielded from dust by a huge curtain during renovations. When a Vatican employee leaves a forklift truck unattended, Napoleon sees away to pull off a job he believes could place him amongst the giants of crime. Napoleon tells the Baron that he will steal the famous statue of the Madonna the Christ from the Vatican. This huge edifice, some 15 feet high and weighing several tons, can be sold a lot of money. To the horror and admiration of his cohorts, Napoleon swathes the statue in a blanket and brazenly carries it on the forklift truck out into the streets of Rome. Back at their hideout, the hungry crooks are jubilant, resolving to sell the priceless stature, for a meager some of 30 million lira. But Cajella lets it slip to Samantha that they have the Pieta. Joe Ventura overhears this and forces Cajella to betray his friends by revealing the statues location. Meanwhile, Napoleon brings Marisa to the hide-out so he can try to seduce her, until he accidentally dislodges the sheet to reveal the Pieta. Marisa, a strict Catholic, falls on her knees in prayer and shames Napoleon into doing likewise. She drags him to a nearby church to confess his crimes. Afterwards, she insists that the statue be returned. Napoleon concedes but claims to the Vatican religious authorities that he only found the statue. Napoleon and Marisa lead the Vatican officials to the gangs hide-out. However, Ventura and his henchmen have arrived at the hide-out first and have bribed the Baron and his group with food, and made off with the statue themselves. Wanted posters depicting Ventura and Cajella are distributed throughout Italy. Ventura and his men decide to head to Sicily, the statue in tow in a caravan, with the Vatican police and diverse cardinals, priests, and monks in hot pursuit. Ventura is forced to stop for a small village parade passing by dramatizing the Stations of the Cross. Then the actor playing Jesus Christ spots Cajella and climbs down from cross to alert the centurions before grabbing a child's bicycle and chasing off after them. Amongst all this, Napoleon, Marisa, the Baron, the Captain and Agonia have teamed up with Cardinal Braun (Heinz Ruhman), a Vatican official with particular interest in the thieves, and who drives like a maniac after the fleeing criminals. Braun drives off a pier and crashes the car on board Ventura's boat just as it sets off for Sicily with the statue. To everyone's surprise, Ventura hands his gun to Braun for it is revealed that Ventura and Braun were old friends in the Mafia before Braun saw the light. As the boat sails away with both gangs on board, Samantha and Cajella are left behind on the pier. Samantha escapes on water skis and Cajella tries to swim after her to escape from a group of angry female clients of his waiting on the pier.

The only part of the original line still in operation is the section between Wuppertal-Oberbarmen and Remscheid-Lennep, which is now part of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen line and operated as Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn line S 7. This is classified as a main line and it is double-track and non-electrified. The section of the line from Remscheid-Lennep to Opladen was known as the \\"Balkan Express\\" because it ran through a sparsely populated area. Services in this section were discontinued in 1994. The line ran between Lennep and Burscheid parallel to federal highway 51 and from Burscheid to Opladen parallel with former federal highway 232. It descends from the Bergisches land to the Rhine Valley between Lennep (337 m above sea level) and Opladen (61 m above sea level). History  The concession for the construction and operation of the line issued to the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkischen Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft, BME),was taken over by the Prussian state railways on 1 January 1882. On 1 September 1868, the BME opened the line between Remscheid and Wuppertal-Oberbarmen (then called Rittershausen) on the Elberfeld–Dortmund railway, which had opened in 1849. A branch line from Lennep to Remscheid was also opened on the same day. Both of these lines are now considered to be parts of the Wuppertal-Oberbarmen–Solingen line. An originally single-track line was opened from Lennep to Wermelskirchen on 15 May 1876 and an extension was opened to Opladen for passengers on 15 October 1881. Freight trains had already begun running to Opladen two weeks before the commencement of passenger services. Stops on the line were initially only at Born, Wermelskirchen, Hilgen and Burscheid. Pattscheid station was opened on 15 November 1881 and further stops were opened between 1900 and 1910. When Deutsche Bundesbahn introduced Uerdingen railbuses for passengers in the early 1950s it built some additional stations that were served only by these railbuses. The line was planned as a regional connection from Wuppertal via Lennep and Opladen to Cologne. Duplication of the line was completed on 28 April 1910. This work removed the remaining level crossings. At the end of World War II, the line was disrupted by Allied bombing and the demolition of many bridges by the Wehrmacht. Freight traffic ran again in August 1945, but passenger services only recommenced in October 1945 due to coal shortages. at that time the line was reduced to single track in places and by 1958 it had been consistently rebuilt as single track between Bergisch Born and Opladen. In order to increase the line’s capacity is it was upgraded to the main line, which involved increasing the line speed from 50 km/h to 80 km/h. Passenger services on the line between Wermelskirchen and Hilgen was discontinued by Deutsche Bundesbahn in May 1983. In 1991, the Opladen–Hilgen section was closed after its telephone line was disrupted by a storm. In 1997, the Lennep–Wermelskirchen section was closed. Part of the route of the former line in Wermelskirchen has been used since August 2005 by a new section of federal highway 51. In the meantime, the cities of Burscheid, Wermelskirchen and Remscheid have agreed to convert the remaining section of the line into a cycling path. Clearing of the line in preparation for the planned works has started in Burscheid, according to an announcement of the press office of the city on 4 January 2011. Deutsche Bahn agreed in late 2011 to sell the section of the line between Opladen and Burscheid to the city of Leverkusen. The Association of Friends and Sponsors of the Balkan Cycling Path (Förderverein der Freunde und Förderer des Radwegs Balkantrasse), which is carrying out the work, anticipates that it will be opened in 2013.

Facts  The case involved two companies: Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) was a minority shareholder in Macduff & Co. JCI had entered into a contract with Macduff whereby the latter would undergo voluntary liquidation. Macduff agreed that, once liquidated, it would transfer all its assets into a newly founded company under the auspices and supervision of JCI. In the agreement was a suspensive condition which permitted liquidation only if the shareholders of Macduff agreed to it. At the time of contracting, this was a promising deal for JCI. When market conditions changed, however, it was no longer of much economic benefit. JCI accordingly bought up shares in Macduff, until it was the majority shareholder, and then voted against liquidation, deliberately obstructing the possibility of the occurrence of the suspensive condition in the contract.  Judgment  The Appellate Division ruled that such obstruction was unlawful, and therefore that there was fictional fulfillment of the suspensive condition. JCI was thus held liable for breach of contract.  See also  * Contract * Law of South Africa * South African contract law  References   Books  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al.

May 25 *Somali government forces backed by African Union tanks reportedly capture the Islamist stronghold of Afgooye, located on the outskirts of Mogadishu. The town was considered strategically important, as it offered Al- Shabaab insurgents direct access to the capital. Thousands of people on the outskirts of the town fled toward Mogadishu and Afgooye ahead of the offensive, with international aid now likely to reach them. No civilian casualties were reported. According to the BBC, securing Afgooye essentially cuts the militant group's controlled territory in half.

June 22 * Al- Shabaab fighters ambush a Somali military convoy in the Elasha Biyaha neighborhood of Mogadishu, killing the local police chief. June 23 * AMISOM troops wrest control of the Middle Shabelle region's Esaley Airstrip and Elma'an Port from Al-Shabaab. Situated about 37 km northeast of Mogadishu, the Esaley Airstrip was strategically important for the insurgent group since it was used by the militants to transport illicit weapons and to fly in foreign fighters from the Gulf of Aden. June 26 *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM soldiers and tanks capture the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Balad, situated 30 km (20 miles) to the north of Mogadishu, in addition to the surrounding villages. The insurgents reportedly fled the area prior to the arrival of the allied troops. Securing Balad gives the Somali authorities and AMISOM control of a key bridge over the Shebelle River leading toward Jowhar and more northerly areas. July July 11 *AMISOM and pro-government forces captured the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Lanta-Buro 25 miles (40 km) west of Mogadishu; the city had been one of Al-Shabaab's primary training bases for militant forces across the country. The city was reportedly abandoned by Al- Shabaab before the offensive force arrived and no fighting was reported. According to the combined Somali-AMISOM leadership, the next target of the offensive would be the coastal city of Merka. August August 4 *Somali forces engaged in battle with al-Shabaab insurgents in the town of Qansah Dhere, at least 15 people were killed.

Kenyan forces also reportedly massing tanks and artillery around Biibi village, 85 km north of Kismayu in an attempt to take this port town. August 12 *Two Uganda People's Defence Force MI-24 helicopters flying from Entebbe, Uganda to Somalia crashed in rugged terrain in Kenya. They were found two days later, burned out, with no likely survivors from the 10 Ugandan servicemen on board. Another aircraft from the same flight crashed on Mount Kenya and all of its seven Ugandan servicemen were rescued a day later.Burnt wreckage of two Ugandan army helicopters found, AFP via SpaceWar.com, 14 October 2012, accessed 15 August 2012 August 16 *Kenyan Defense Forces stationed in Southern Somalia as part of AMISOM were reported to have engaged in combat with as many as a thousand Al-Shabaab militants who attempted to assault the Kenyan garrison in Fafadhun. The Kenyan forces however were said to have successfully repulsed the attack, with at least two Kenyan soldiers and at least 73 Al-Shabaab militants reported dead as a result of the fighting. After the remaining attackers fled, the Kenyan forces reportedly captured forty guns and six trucks abandoned by Al-Shabaab in their retreat. The increased Kenyan presence in the area is part of Kenya's effort to reinforce the security of its southern border with Somalia and as part of AMISOM's effort to eventually retake the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Kismayo. August 27 *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture the port town of Merca from Al-Shabaab. Residents indicate that the militants had fled a few hours earlier to Kismayo, which represents the outfit's last major stronghold. August 29 *Somali government forces backed by African Union troops battle Al-Shabaab militants in the villages of Aglibah, Janaay, Abdulle and Birta Dheer, situated between Afmadow and Kismayo. According to General Ismail Sahardiid, the commander in charge of Somali Army troops in the Lower Jubba region, over 60 insurgents died in the crossfire. Al-Shabaab claims in turn to have killed dozens of government soldiers in the ensuing gun battle. With the allied forces reportedly around 50 kilometers (31 miles) near Kismayo, General Sahardiid indicates that his men are advancing toward the stronghold with caution but expect to capture it within a period of seven days. According to a local resident, Al-Shabaab have also positioned armored vehicles on the circumference of the town and are patrolling the area in heavy battle gear and wagons. September September 1 *Somali government forces assisted by African Union troops continue their march toward Kismayo, capturing the southern town of Miido, situated 86 km from the Al-Shabaab stronghold. As many as 36 insurgents were reportedly slain in the assault. AMISOM also deny claims that the insurgents had seized back Afmadow, and dismiss as \\"untrue Al Shabaab propaganda\\" reports that the militant group had gunned down an AU helicopter. Additionally, an AMISOM spokesman characterizes as a \\"very despicable and a shameful act\\" photos released by Al-Shabaab showing bodies of four allied soldiers being dragged through the Kismayo streets. September 3 *In support of the Somali army's offensive in Kismayo against Al-Shabaab, AMISOM soldiers backed by KDF vessels and helicopters reach the nearby town of Harbole. The move comes after intensive attacks since August 31 by allied forces against nearby Islamist bases, which resulted in 36 militant casualties. Ugandan and Burundian AU troops are reportedly making their way southward toward the stronghold, with the Kenyan contingent within AMISOM providing facilitative assistance. The combined forces are awaiting for military authorization to launch the ground offensive. September 4 *As part of an offensive by AMISOM, the Kenyan navy shells the Islamist stronghold of Kismayo. According to local residents, hundreds of people begin fleeing the area ahead of an expected land-based assault, with most heading for Jilib to the north and the Somali government-controlled port of Merca. *Somali government forces assisted by African Union troops capture the port of El-ma'an from Al-Shabaab, situated on the outskirts of Mogadishu. According to Daud Hajji Iro, the Middle Shabelle region's spokesman, the insurgents abandoned the town after a bout of fighting. The Islamist group was reportedly unavailable for comment. September 5 *Somali government forces and allied AMISOM troops continue their march toward Kismayo, advancing from the liberated Miido to the nearby town of Biibi. Around 200 Al-Shabaab insurgents and a few senior commanders in Afmadow also surrender to the coalition forces. The defections are interpreted as substantially enhancing the allied offensive since the insurgents could provide details on Al- Shabaab's combat strategy. Additionally, AMISOM's Ugandan and Burundian contingents in Harbole await clearance to attack Kismayo, with Kenyan AU troops preparing to launch an assault from Jilib and Bulla-Hajji in the Jubba region. Residents of Kismayo simultaneously continue to leave the port for the eastern cities of Barawe and Merca ahead of the planned offensive. September 18 *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops continue their march towards Kismayo. Local residents report that Al-Shabaab militants are leaving the port in trucks and buses with heavy weaponry in tow, in the direction of Jilib to the northeast. The insurgents also reportedly free some prisoners before exiting. Al-Shabaab dismiss the claims as \\"blatant lies\\" and suggest that affairs in Kismayo are \\"business as usual.\\" An estimated 5,200 people have fled the town since the start of the month ahead of the offensive. According to Somali National Army General Ismail Sahareed, his forces defeated the insurgents in confrontations a few days earlier, and the SNA, which is positioned about 67 km away, is now preparing to close in on Kismayo; AMISOM forces are in turn reportedly stationed about 39 km from the city, in the town of Jana Cabdalla. Al-Shabaab claim instead to have killed around 100 Somali government soldiers and AU troops from Kenya. Additionally, a spokesperson with the US Navy admits that an American warship is positioned near the port, but suggests that it is there for maintenance purposes. He also asserts that he does not know if the vessel intends to alight on the city. September 22 *An additional 200 Al-Shabaab insurgents in the town of Garsale near Jowhar surrender to allied troops. This followed a round of internal battles between rival militants, which left eight of the outfit's fighters dead, including two top commanders. AMISOM announces in a press statement that it expects the total number of Al-Shabaab defections in the area to reach 250 men. September 24 *Somali National Army spokesman Adan Mohamed Hirsi accuses Kenyan troops of intentionally killing seven Somali civilians in a joint Somali-AMISOM operation in Janay Abdalla village. The murders came after an earlier ambush attempt by Al-Shabaab against Somali and Kenyan soldiers. The young men were in the process of buying sugar when they were shot down, and two other civilians were reportedly also injured. According to BBC correspondent Gabriel Gatehouse, Kenyan forces have already been accused of indiscriminately killing civilians when they shelled Kismayo from warships operating off of the port city's coastline. Hirsi condemns the latest murders and requests that the Somali authorities take action. AU spokesman Col. Ali Aden also indicates that an investigation into the incident has been launched and appropriate action will be pursued once it concludes. *Hizbul Islam spokesman Mohamed Moallim announces that his group is discontinuing its association with Al-Shabaab, an outfit that he asserts his organization had only nominally united with. Moallim cites the significant political changes happening in Somalia as well as Al-Shabaab's reported issuance of propaganda against Hizbul Islam as the primary reasons for his group's decision to leave the coalition. He adds that his organization does not share Al-Shabaab's political philosophy, and that he feels the militant group has been considerably \\"weakened\\". Moallim also indicates that Hizbul Islam is open to talks with any political actors in the country working for a common good. September 25 *Fighter jets belonging to AMISOM's Kenyan contingent bombard an airport armoury and warehouse in Kismayo that was used by Al-Shabaab. Although casualty figures are uncertain, Ali Mohamud Rage, a spokesman for the Islamist group, indicates that there are no deaths or property damage, but that \\"the Kenyan airforce was maybe trying to boost the morale of its demoralised soldiers.\\" Kenyan troops are reportedly positioned around 40 km from Kismayo. They have been striving to defeat Al-Shabaab militants in the city since they first deployed soldiers to southern Somalia in 2011. September 28 *According to AMISOM official Col. Cyrus Oguna, the Somali National Army and Kenyan AU naval, air and ground forces launched a surprise attack on Kismayo, capturing the city with little resistance mounted by Al-Shabaab. The spokesman asserts that the insurgents incurred \\"heavy losses\\" during the offensive, whereas no allied soldiers were wounded or killed. Fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia also reportedly assisted the SNA and AU troops, who led the charge. Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab states that \\"fierce fighting\\" is underway between his comrades and the Somali and AMISOM forces. Local residents similarly indicate that the allied troops have seized the port, but the militants are still present elsewhere in the town and are quickly making their way toward the frontlines in vehicles. The Islamist group's propaganda radio station is also still reportedly broadcasting material and allegedly attempting to trick residents into fleeing toward the oncoming Somali government and AMISOM troops. Kismayo is regarded as Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold on account of the revenue that the group has been able to generate for itself through exporting charcoal and levying port taxes on imported goods. Col. Oguna indicates that capturing the city \\"may signal the end of al-Shabab because Kismayo has been the bastion which has financed activities of the al-Shabab in other regions of Somalia\\". Owing to uncertainty as to who will administer the town after the Islamists have been completely ousted, the AU spokesman adds that the offensive was \\"meticulously planned\\". October October 14 *Somali government soldiers assisted by AMISOM troops capture the strategically important town of Wanla Weyn, located 93 km northwest of Mogadishu. The victory permits a direct route connecting the capital with the recently secured city of Baidoa. According to Somali government and AU officials, it also cuts off Al-Shabaab's access to other regions, and denies the militants another key source of funds. Additionally, the allied forces seize control of a former Somali Air Force (SAF) base, situated within 15 km of Wanla Weyn. October 29 *Somali military sources report that General Mohamed Ibrahim Farah (Gordan) is killed in an ambush attack by Al-Shabaab insurgents. The surprise assault occurred in the town of El Waregow, near the port of Marko (Merca). Al-Shabaab did not comment on the assassination. November November 12 *At least 7 soldiers and 3 civilians were killed in an ambush by Al-Shabaab insurgents on an Ethiopian convoy near Baidoa. November 25 *Al Shabaab fighters attack Bulohawo near the border with Kenya. They briefly took control of the small town before retreating to the Somali army. Twelve people from both sides were reportedly killed. December December 9 *Somali government forces assisted by AMISOM troops capture the Al-Shabaab stronghold of Jowhar, situated 90 kilometres (60 miles) north of Mogadishu. December 17 *Al-Shabaab posts a message on Twitter publicly chastising the group's senior American commander Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki (Omar Shafik Hammami) for releasing videos in a \\"narcissistic pursuit of fame.\\" The tweet also asserts that attempts behind the scenes by the outfit to talk to Al-Amriki were in vain, so Al-Shabaab was morally obligated to divulge his \\"obstinacy\\". December 18 *Somalia national army (SNA) and Kenya defense forces have taken control of Kudha and Madhawa islands which are some 130 km (81 miles) to the West of Kismayo. Al-shabaab militants withdraw from Kudha island before the allied forces entered. But there was fighting in Madhawa.

The Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro (AMRJ) is a military organization of the Brazilian Navy. It is located in Ilha das Cobras, at the Guanabara Bay, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The Arsenal is the main maintenance center and naval base of the Brazilian Navy, involving the design, construction and maintenance of ships and submarines, not only for the Brazilian Navy, but also to friendly nations. The AMRJ provides shipbuilding services both for military strategic reasons (mastery of technologies, seeking the reduction of external dependence), as economic ones, seeking nationalisation of components and the encouragement of domestic industry. Beside the AMRJ, the Brazilian Navy also has naval bases, that act in support of the Naval Districts, ships in transit or in specific technical areas. Among them are the Naval Base of Aratu, the Naval Base of Val-de-Cães and the River Base of Ladário.  History  The institution dates back to the installation of Arsenal do Rio de Janeiro, at the foot of the hill of St. Benedict. Created in December 29, 1763 by the viceroy Antônio Álvares da Cunha, first count da Cunha, had the intention to repair the ships of the Portuguese Navy. At the time, the capital of the colony was being transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro, among other reasons, for a better protection of the gold that came from Minas Gerais by the Royal Road. With the arrival of the Portuguese Royal Family in 1808, the Arsenal started to be designated as Arsenal Real da Marinha or simply as Arsenal da Corte. In 1820, its dependencies began to expand to the Ilha das Cobras. After the independence of Brazil, faced with the need to organize and operate a Navy, the activities of the Arsenal became a priority. At this stage, started to be called as Arsenal Imperial da Marinha, better known as Arsenal de Marinha da Corte. The nineteenth century watched the transition from sailing to steam navigation. During the so-called Era Mauá, the vessels were built in the shipyard in Ponta da Areia, in Niterói. Later, with the outbreak of the Paraguayan War, vessels for the Brazilian Navy were built in shipyards in the England and in the AMRJ. At the end of the conflict, Brazil had the most powerful navy in the South Atlantic,https://books.google.com.br/books?id=MUii7f4SlCAC&pg;=PA8&lpg;=PA8&dq;=after+paraguaian+war+Brazil+had+the+most+powerful+navy&source;=bl&ots;=8doSprQXtA&sig;=ACfU3U16Mp2naKHV0Ky98x5yFmSFaRpVVA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwigu5_nwYjnAhWBK7kGHefFBOUQ6AEwDHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q;=after%20paraguaian%20war%20Brazil%20had%20the%20most%20powerful%20navy&f;=false and the AMRJ a valuable and experienced body of naval engineers, which provided the country the capacity to design and build its own ships. In 1938 two Arsenals coexisted: the Arsenal de Marinha das Ilha das Cobras (AMIC) and the Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro (AMRJ). After 1948, only the Arsenal located in Ilha das Cobras survived, assuming the designation of Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro.  Main achievements  Between the construction of surface units and submarines, and the activity of maintenance of the fleet, the AMRJ has its capacity recognized in Brazil and the world. Using advanced technology, professionalism and creativity, besides the countless daily tasks, in the last years, the AMRJ faced and overcome successfully the following challenges: * 2005 - 2009 - two dockings and a revitalization program of the aircraft carrier São Paulo; * 2005 - 2006 - transport of the submarine S Timbira from sea to workshop, using ferries and trucks (\\"load-in\\") and realization of its Programme of General Maintenance within a much lower time than the ones on Tupi and Tamoio's PMGs (General Modernisation Programs); * 2005 - refurbishment of gearboxes of the Frigate Constituição; * 2003 - docking of the aircraft carrier São Paulo; * constructing the submarines Tamoio, Timbira, Tapajó and Tikuna (Tikuna's construction time was reduced in 11 months, recovering part of the delay, due to budget constraints); * construction of the Niterói Class frigates: Independência and União; * construction of the Inhaúma Class corvettes: Inhaúma and Jaceguai; * Modernization Programme (ModFrag) of all Niteroi class frigate. * large repairs in Argentine submarine ARA Santa Cruz, including cutting the hull. The AMRJ was honored by the Pan American Institute of Naval Engineering for its contribution to the development of the Naval Engineering in the America, in 2002-2003, during the meeting in Havana, Cuba. The achievement was repeated in 2004-2005, during the meeting in Guayaquil, Ecuador.  Ships built in AMRJ  * The first ship built on the Arsenal was the ship D. Sebastião, finished in 1767. * The last was the Corvette Barroso (V-34), in 2005. * The oldest in operation: Monitor Parnaíba (U-17), finished in 1937.

It was built circa 1849–50, designed by architect Anthony Salvin in the Gothic Revival style and is now Grade II listed. The church is located on the South side of Uxbridge Road on the corner of Coverdale Road, to the west of Shepherd's Bush tube station. In the 1950s St Stephen's welcomed many members of the so-called \\"Windrush Generation\\" from the West Indies, and in 1962 the Barbadian-born Reverend Wilfred Wood became curate to St Stephen's, later becoming the Church of England's first black bishop. In 1966 the vicar John Asbridge, frustrated by the chronic shortage of local housing, set up the Shepherds Bush Housing Association. Today St Stephen's ministers to a diverse congregation, and serves a hot meal to up to 100 homeless people every Monday. The church is on Historic England's Heritage at Risk Register and an appeal has been launched to raise funds to repair the roof. History St Stephen's Church (c1904) with the original spire Uxbridge Rd and St Stephen's Spire circa 1900 19th Century Origins The Church of St Stephen was built circa 1849–50, designed by architect Anthony Salvin, and built in the Gothic Revival style with a tower.Melanie Barber, Gabriel Sewell & Stephen Taylor, p.401, From the Reformation to the Permissive Society: a Miscellany, Lambeth palace Library Retrieved January 2012 Much of the cost of building the church was borne by Bishop Blomfield. The site for the church was provided in part by James Gomme (d. 1855) who is commemorated in a stained- glass window.Stained Glass Window in North Aisle St Stephen's was built as a so-called 'Commissioners' church'; an Anglican church in the United Kingdom built with money voted by Parliament as a result of the Church Building Act 1818, and subsequent related Acts. Such churches have been given a number of titles, including \\"Commissioners' Churches\\", \\"Waterloo Churches\\" and \\"Million Act Churches\\". In some cases the Commissioners provided the full cost of the new church; in other cases they provided a grant and the balance was raised locally. St Stephen's was built of Kentish Ragstone with Bath stone dressings. It had a \\"very well developed chancel\\". The stained-glass windows were manufactured by William Wailes and were donated by members of the clergy and other well-wishers. The church was consecrated in 1850 and the whole of the parish north of Goldhawk Road was allocated to it. However, by 1870 the expanding population of Shepherd's Bush meant that the church was already overcrowded.Denny, p.58 On completion, the periodical The Ecclesiologist, which was strongly in favour of the Gothic Revival movement, commented that the new church: :\\"has a peculiar value, as indicating how far our diocesan is willing to take the peculiar responsibility of those various features of the arrangements and decoration, which from desuetude had become to a great extent novelties in England when we first advocated their revival\\". In 1850 William Cooke became priest in charge of St Stephen's. Cooke was a graduate of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and a noted hymn-writer and translator.Samuel Willoughby Duffield, English Hymns: Their Authors and History (1886), p. 358 World Wars War Memorial in North aisle 91 parishioners of St Stephen's were killed during World War I; their names are recorded in the war memorial inside the church, mounted on the wall of the North aisle. A number were decorated for courage; these included Charles Carey, MM, L. W. Moberley, MC, and Captain Charles George Douglas Napier, MC, DCM (1892 – 15 May 1918). Napier was a flying ace credited with nine aerial victories, flying the Bristol F.2 Fighter, before being himself killed in action.War Memorial, St Stephen's Shepherd's Bush When Napier was awarded his MC, it was noted in the London Gazette that he \\"displayed the greatest judgment, determination and daring\\". The church was hit by enemy bombing in around 1940 or 1941. The spire was damaged, apparently beyond repair. In the same raid the original stained-glass windows on the north aisle of the church were destroyed, as well as the great east and west windows.Byford, p2 Post-War era and the Windrush Generation In 1949 scaffolding was erected to effect repairs to the spire, but it could not be saved, and was therefore taken down and replaced by the present structure, a low octagonal copper flèche.Porter, p3 In 1950 centenary celebrations were held, including a \\"great pageant\\" and a \\"centenary dinner\\", attended by William Wand, the Bishop of London. In the 1950s many immigrants from the West Indies settled in Shepherds Bush, with St Stephen's becoming known as a church that welcomed what would become known as the Windrush Generation. In 1962 the Barbadian-born Wilfred Wood became curate to St Stephen's.Byford, p3 Wood was a lifelong champion of racial justice, who in 1985 became the Church of England's first black bishop. Bishop Wood's influence is still felt today as many West Indian families remain rooted in St Stephen's. In 1958 The pipe organ, originally made by Henry Willis & Sons in 1888, was moved to the church from St Andrew, Haverstock Hill, where it was \\"restored and rebuilt\\" by N. P. Mander Ltd.Plaque on pipe organ In 1960 the parish was amalgamated with that of St Thomas, forming the new parish of St Stephen's and St Thomas. The church has a memorial to PC David Wombwell, a police officer who was murdered in 1966 in what became known as the Shepherd's Bush murders. Shepherds Bush Housing Association In 1966 the Rev John Asbridge, vicar of St Stephen's, set up the Shepherds Bush Housing Association, in order to help solve the urgent need for housing for poor parishioners. The choir vestry at St Stephen's was used as an office, which was run by volunteers from the parish. In addition, help was given by a number of parishioners who gifted their own houses to the association for use by homeless people. Their first acquisition was a dilapidated house at 220 Hammersmith Grove, which was converted into flats. Asbridge ran the Association for 20 years, retiring in 1988.Interview with John Asbridge Retrieved 19 July 2017 Today, the Shepherd's Bush Housing Association owns and manages more than 5,000 homes.Official Website of the SBHG Retrieved 19 July 2017 In 1970 the church became a Listed Building.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 34 *Liberal Democrat 6 *Independent 2 Background Before the election the Conservatives controlled the council with 33 councillors, compared to 7 Liberal Democrats and 2 independents. In 2010 councillor Lisa Bangs had left the Liberal Democrats, in protest against the party's decision to enter a coalition with the Conservatives nationally. Bangs would defend her seat in Lingfield and Crowhurst as an independent against a UK Independence Party opponent. The other independent councillor, Bob David, meanwhile held his seat in Tatsfield and Tisley without opposition. Election result The Conservatives increased their majority on the council after gaining one seat from the Liberal Democrats in Warlingham East, Chelsham & Farleigh by a 164-vote majority. This meant the Conservatives won 10 of the 14 seats contested, taking the Conservatives to 34 councillors and reducing the Liberal Democrats to 6. The Liberal Democrats held 2 seats, with group leader Chris Botten holding his seat in Portley by 37 votes and Jill Caudle retained the other seat in Valley with a reduced majority. Meanwhile, independents remained on 2 seats, as former Liberal Democrat Lisa Bangs kept Lingfield and Crowhurst with an increased 1,182 votes. Overall turnout at the election was 48.62%.

It was the 2012 winner of the National Academies Communication Award for best creative work that helps the public understanding of topics of behavioral science, engineering and medicine. The book summarizes research that Kahneman performed during decades, often in collaboration with Amos Tversky. It covers all three phases of his career: his early work concerning cognitive biases, his work on prospect theory, and his later work on happiness. The main thesis is that of a dichotomy between two modes of thought: \\"System 1\\" is fast, instinctive and emotional; \\"System 2\\" is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The book delineates rational and non-rational motivations/triggers associated with each type of thinking process, and how they complement each other, starting with Kahneman's own research on loss aversion. From framing choices to people's tendency to replace a difficult question with one which is easy to answer, the book summarizes several decades of research to suggest that people have too much confidence in human judgement. The book also shares many insights from Kahneman's work with the Israel Defense Forces and with the various departments and collaborators that have contributed to his education as a researcher.  Summary   Two systems  In the book's first section, Kahneman describes two different ways the brain forms thoughts: * System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious. Examples (in order of complexity) of things system 1 can do: ** determine that an object is at a greater distance than another ** localize the source of a specific sound ** complete the phrase \\"war and ...\\" ** display disgust when seeing a gruesome image ** solve 2+2=? ** read text on a billboard ** drive a car on an empty road ** think of a good chess move (if you're a chess master) ** understand simple sentences ** associate the description 'quiet and structured person with an eye for details' with a specific job * System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious. Examples of things system 2 can do: ** prepare yourself for the start of a sprint ** direct your attention towards the clowns at the circus ** direct your attention towards someone at a loud party ** look for the woman with the grey hair ** try to recognize a sound ** sustain a faster than normal walking rate ** determine the appropriateness of a particular behavior in a social setting ** count the number of A's in a certain text ** give someone your telephone number ** park into a tight parking space ** determine the price/quality ratio of two washing machines ** determine the validity of a complex logical reasoning ** solve 17 × 24 Kahneman describes a number of experiments which purport to examine the differences between these two thought systems and how they arrive at different results even given the same inputs. Terms and concepts include coherence, attention, laziness, association, jumping to conclusions, WYSIATI (What you see is all there is), and how one forms judgments. The System 1 vs. System 2 debate includes the reasoning or lack thereof for human decision making, with big implications for many areas including law and market research.  Heuristics and biases  The second section offers explanations for why humans struggle to think statistically. It begins by documenting a variety of situations in which we either arrive at binary decisions or fail to associate precisely reasonable probabilities with outcomes. Kahneman explains this phenomenon using the theory of heuristics. Kahneman and Tversky originally discussed this topic in their 1974 article titled Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases. Kahneman uses heuristics to assert that System 1 thinking involves associating new information with existing patterns, or thoughts, rather than creating new patterns for each new experience. For example, a child who has only seen shapes with straight edges might perceive an octagon when first viewing a circle. As a legal metaphor, a judge limited to heuristic thinking would only be able to think of similar historical cases when presented with a new dispute, rather than considering the unique aspects of that case. In addition to offering an explanation for the statistical problem, the theory also offers an explanation for human biases. = Anchoring = The \\"anchoring effect\\" names our tendency to be influenced by irrelevant numbers. Shown greater/lesser numbers, experimental subjects gave greater/lesser responses. This is an important concept to have in mind when navigating a negotiation or considering a price. As an example, most people, when asked whether Gandhi was more than 114 years old when he died, will provide a much greater estimate of his age at death than others who were asked whether Gandhi was more or less than 35 years old. Experiments show that our behavior is influenced, much more than we know or want, by the environment of the moment. = Availability = The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that occurs when people make judgments about the probability of events on the basis of how easy it is to think of examples. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that, \\"if you can think of it, it must be important\\". The availability of consequences associated with an action is related positively to perceptions of the magnitude of the consequences of that action. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something, the greater we perceive these consequences to be. Sometimes, this heuristic is beneficial, but the frequencies at which events come to mind are usually not accurate representations of the probabilities of such events in real life. = Substitution = System 1 is prone to substituting a simpler question for a difficult one. In what Kahneman terms their \\"best-known and most controversial\\" experiment, \\"the Linda problem,\\" subjects were told about an imaginary Linda, young, single, outspoken, and intelligent, who, as a student, was very concerned with discrimination and social justice. They asked whether it was more probable that Linda is a bank teller or that she is a bank teller and an active feminist. The overwhelming response was that \\"feminist bank teller\\" was more likely than \\"bank teller,\\" violating the laws of probability. (Every feminist bank teller is a bank teller). In this case System 1 substituted the easier question, \\"Is Linda a feminist?\\", neglecting the occupation qualifier. An alternative opinion is that the subjects added an unstated cultural implicature to the effect that the other answer implied an exclusive or, that Linda was not a feminist. = Optimism and loss aversion = Kahneman writes of a \\"pervasive optimistic bias\\", which \\"may well be the most significant of the cognitive biases.\\" This bias generates the illusion of control, that we have substantial control of our lives. A natural experiment reveals the prevalence of one kind of unwarranted optimism. The planning fallacy is the tendency to overestimate benefits and underestimate costs, impelling people to begin risky projects. During 2002, American kitchen remodeling was expected on average to cost $18,658, but actually cost $38,769. To explain overconfidence, Kahneman introduces the concept he terms What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI). This theory states that when the mind makes decisions, it deals primarily with Known Knowns, phenomena it has observed already. It rarely considers Known Unknowns, phenomena that it knows to be relevant but about which it does not have information. Finally it appears oblivious to the possibility of Unknown Unknowns, unknown phenomena of unknown relevance. He explains that humans fail to take into account complexity and that their understanding of the world consists of a small and necessarily un- representative set of observations. Furthermore, the mind generally does not account for the role of chance and therefore falsely assumes that a future event will be similar to a past event. = Framing = Framing is the context in which choices are presented. Experiment: subjects were asked whether they would opt for surgery if the \\"survival\\" rate is 90 percent, while others were told that the mortality rate is 10 percent. The first framing increased acceptance, even though the situation was no different. = Sunk- cost = Rather than consider the odds that an incremental investment would produce a positive return, people tend to \\"throw good money after bad\\" and continue investing in projects with poor prospects that have already consumed significant resources. In part this is to avoid feelings of regret.  Overconfidence  This section of the book is dedicated to the undue confidence in what the mind believes it knows. It suggests that people often overestimate how much they understand about the world and underestimate the role of chance in particular. This is related to the excessive certainty of hindsight, when an event seems to be understood after it has occurred or developed. Kahneman's opinions concerning overconfidence are influenced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.  Choices  In this section Kahneman returns to economics and expands his seminal work on Prospect Theory. He discusses the tendency for problems to be addressed in isolation and how, when other reference points are considered, the choice of that reference point (called a frame) has a disproportionate effect on the outcome. This section also offers advice on how some of the shortcomings of System 1 thinking can be avoided. = Prospect theory = Kahneman developed prospect theory, the basis for his Nobel prize, to account for experimental errors he noticed in Daniel Bernoulli's traditional utility theory. According to Kahneman, Utility Theory makes logical assumptions of economic rationality that do not represent people's actual choices, and does not take into account cognitive biases. One example is that people are loss-averse: they are more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve a gain. Another example is that the value people place on a change in probability (e.g., of winning something) depends on the reference point: people seem to place greater value on a change from 0% to 10% (going from impossibility to possibility) than from, say, 45% to 55%, and they place the greatest value of all on a change from 90% to 100% (going from possibility to certainty). This occurs despite the fact that by traditional utility theory all three changes give the same increase in utility. Consistent with loss- aversion, the order of the first and third of those is reversed when the event is presented as losing rather than winning something: there, the greatest value is placed on eliminating the probability of a loss to 0. After the book's publication, the Journal of Economic Literature published a discussion of its parts concerning prospect theory, as well as an analysis of the four fundamental factors on which it is based.  Two selves  The fifth part of the book describes recent evidence which introduces a distinction between two selves, the 'experiencing self' and 'remembering self'. = Two selves = Kahneman proposed an alternative measure that assessed pleasure or pain sampled from moment to moment, and then summed over time. Kahneman termed this \\"experienced\\" well-being and attached it to a separate \\"self.\\" He distinguished this from the \\"remembered\\" well-being that the polls had attempted to measure. He found that these two measures of happiness diverged. = Life as a story = The author's significant discovery was that the remembering self does not care about the duration of a pleasant or unpleasant experience. Instead, it retrospectively rates an experience by the maximum or minimum of the experience, and by the way it ends. The remembering self dominated the patient's ultimate conclusion. = Experienced well-being = Kahneman first began the study of well-being during the 1990s. At the time most happiness research relied on polls about life satisfaction. Having previously studied unreliable memories, the author was doubtful that life satisfaction was a good indicator of happiness. He designed a question that emphasized instead the well-being of the experiencing self. The author proposed that \\"Helen was happy in the month of March\\" if she spent most of her time engaged in activities that she would rather continue than stop, little time in situations that she wished to escape, and not too much time in a neutral state that wouldn't prefer continuing or stopping the activity either way. = Thinking about life = Kahneman suggests that emphasizing a life event such as a marriage or a new car can provide a distorted illusion of its true value. This \\"focusing illusion\\" revisits earlier ideas of substituting difficult questions and WYSIATI.

It was released on September 11, 2012 on Seven Arts Music. Background On October 11, 2011 DMX performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards. He stated that he has been working \\"nonstop, every day\\" on the new album, and plans to release it before December 2012. During a performance at New York City's Santos Party House on December 25, 2011, DMX stated that the new album will be entitled Undisputed and would be released on March 26, 2012. This was later confirmed by DMX via his official Twitter account, where he also confirmed that its first single is scheduled for release in January 2012. A video for a new track entitled \\"Last Hope\\" was released via Internet on September 24, 2011. This was later released on his The Weigh In EP and omitted from the final release of Undisputed. Seven Arts Entertainment Inc. recently purchased David Michery's music assets, which included some of DMX's music. DMX's had announced that Undisputed will be released on March 27, 2012. However it was later revealed that DMX did not plan to release the album on that date, and that date was one forced upon him by the record label. The release date for the album was set for June 26, 2012. However, DMX announced in Detroit, Michigan on June 9, 2012, that due to the record label, the date will be pushed back again. It was then scheduled for release on August 28, 2012. Later, an official press release from the label pushed the back date to September 11, 2012. He donated the album's first week sales to the victims of the September 11 attacks. The album features only one male guest appearance by rapper Machine Gun Kelly. The album was also supposed to feature Sean Kingston, Tyrese and Busta Rhymes, but none of these artists were featured in the final cut. Release and promotion On May 15, 2012, DMX and Dame Grease released a pre-album EP which would be free for download, called The Weigh In featuring artists such as Snoop Dogg, Big Stan and Tyrese. It also featured production from West Coast rapper and producer Dr. Dre. Promoting his album, DMX announced the Undisputed Tour, with 15 concerts, across the United States throughout June and early July, hitting everywhere from New York to Hawaii. Singles On January 6, 2012, DMX performed live the first single of the album, \\"I Don't Dance\\" featuring MGK in Long Beach. It was released on iTunes on April 7, 2012. DMX shot a video for the song, also featuring MGK. He also released a behind-the-scenes video. The official video premiered on MTV Jams on June 23, 2012 and was later uploaded to his YouTube account. Xzibit made a cameo appearance. DMX released the second single, \\"Head Up\\", on September 4, 2012. Reception Critical reception Upon its release, Undisputed received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Christopher Minaya of XXL said, \\"X provides more bark than bite this go- around, as he often leaves listeners yearning for more lyrically while the selection of beats is open to discussion as many are up to snuff at best. Peaking so early in his career was a gift to his legacy but a curse to his longevity. As a result, fans understandably expect another \\"Party Up (Up In Here),\\" yet \\"I Don't Dance\\" is simply not that. Undisputed exhibits little of X's impressive illustration but renews the high level of passion and energy he excels at relaying to listeners. X has been staying out of trouble, making it to shows and has improved his raps since The Weigh In, a trend one can only wish continues.\\" In a mixed review Ken Capobianco writing for the Boston Globe stated, \\"on his comeback after years of career self-destruction, he doesn’t come close to recapturing the intensity and glorious contradictions of his best work. Despite some excellent beats from some of his Ruff Ryder heyday producers including Swizz Beatz, the MC struggles to tap into the menacing, confrontational bark that made him a star.\\" Pete T of RapReviews said, \\"the at-times triumphant return Undisputed wears many hats and dons most of them admirably. Here you'll find his trademark street anthems replete with horns and barking, desolate monologues toward a silent God, and endless exploration of a chronically conflicted character. He doesn't break much new ground, nor does he lend the sense that he's forcibly trying to reclaim past glory. Upon hearing the opener \\"What They Don't Know,\\" an archetypal Swizz Beatz jam that stands among the best the duo ever concocted, it's almost impossible not to proclaim the return of the dog.\\" Huffington Post labeled DMX as past his prime, but also said \\"The production on Undisputed is respectable with Swizz Beatz, J.R. Rotem, Dame Grease and Tronzilla laying down the tracks, but their efforts don't help the overall quality. Surprisingly, the most enjoyable songs aren't the hardcore ones. Instead, it's the R&B-flavored; \\"Cold World\\" and \\"No Love\\".\\" Rap Radar named it the fifth most disappointing album of 2012. Colton S. of TheVersed stated, \\"Overall, Undisputed, is an admirable effort from one of hip hop’s most esteemed, important, and interesting artists. As strange as it sounds, DMX is at his best here when he holds himself back a little and opens up about his personal struggles. Unfortunately, he only does that on a small handful tracks. Throughout the rest of the project we get some interesting, yet technically deficient religious songs, and some misguided attempts at some of the high-energy party anthems he became famous for.\\" Commercial performance The album debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 selling 17,000 copies, while making it to number 2 in R&B;/ Hip- Hop Albums.

This company was registered by co-owners Gary Michael Voris and John Fitzpatrick Mola with the State of Michigan on July 8, 1997. Voris cites the death of his brother from a heart attack in 2003, followed by his mother dying from stomach cancer in 2004 as the events that moved him to go from being \\"a lukewarm Catholic, someone who usually just went through the motions at church\\" to an \\"aggressive global advocate for conservative Catholics ,,, on a burning mission to save Catholicism and America by trying to warn the public about what he sees as a decline of morality in society.\\" Voris is reported to work \\"up to 18 hours a day, seven days a week\\" on creating presentations for St. Michael's Media. In 2009, Voris received an STB degree from the Angelicum in Rome via Sacred Heart Major Seminary, graduating magna cum laude. St. Michael's Media After being a guest speaker at several Catholic parishes in Detroit and serving as a host on the Michigan Catholic Radio network, in 2006 Voris started the digital television studio St. Michael's Media in Ferndale, Michigan. Voris's move into Catholic video broadcasting was in response to the book and film The Da Vinci Code. In 2011 the Archdiocese of Detroit, citing canon 216 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, published notice to Voris and RealCatholicTV that \\"it [did] not regard them as being authorized to use the word 'Catholic' to identify or promote their public activities.\\" In 2012 the company name RealCatholicTV.com was changed to \\"ChurchMilitant.tv\\"., which later became ChurchMilitant.com. Church Militant has rejected the archdiocese's claims of disobedience and published an article detailing the apostolate's relationship with the archdiocese and the origins of the notice. \\"To this day, the archdiocese of Detroit has never specified any programming or content produced by St. Michael’s Media that it has found heterodox or problematic. It has issued no censure or delict against this apostolate, which remains in good standing in the Church,\\" the article states. Some critics of Voris within the Catholic Church (\\"from Pennsylvania to Spain to Detroit\\") have said that \\"his remarks, at times, promote division and extremism\\". Scranton ban Voris's comments questioning the validity of Rabbinical Judaism were later cited when he attempted to give a presentation in the Diocese of Scranton, Pennsylvania. In April 2011, Voris, who had intended to give a talk entitled \\"Living Catholicism Radically\\", was banned from speaking at Marywood University or any facilities owned by the Diocese. This action was taken after complaints were made about Voris's statements about other religions. In a letter to the talk's organizers, Paul and Kristen Ciaccia, the Diocese declared that it had \\"learned from\\" the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and Mr. Voris's home Archdiocese of Detroit that Voris's presentations had caused \\"'a number of controversies' and that his programs are not endorsed by his home archdiocese.\\" Using a press release issued by the Archdiocese of Detroit, the Catholic Diocese of Scranton issued a statement in response to a planned speaking engagement of Voris in that diocese, saying that, \\"Although the Diocese shares Mr. Voris’ support of efforts to protect human life, his extreme positions on other faiths are not appropriate and therefore the Diocese cannot host him.\\" Voris ascribed this decision to \\"political correctness. Anything somebody takes offense at, whether it's true or not, seems to be out of bounds.\\" The speech was moved to the Best Western Genetti Hotel and Conference Center in Wilkes-Barre, and the talk's organizers invited local bishop Joseph Bambera to attend \\"to evaluate Mr. Voris' knowledge of the faith, free from opinions formed by others.\\" The bishop did not take up the offer. The Ciaccias said the ban \\"belies deeper inconsistencies in diocesan policy.\\" Voris spoke about the events in a video segment, noting the diocese allowed Sara Bendoraitis, the director of the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Ally Resource Center at American University, to speak at the University of Scranton the previous spring.

Most of its members lived in the United Kingdom. In 1976 an educational journal described the growth of \\"hobbyist\\" computing and said \\"in [the UK] there is currently one shop ... and also an active Amateur Computer Club with over 600 members\\".  Foundation  Starting the ACC was an initiative of Mike Lord of Basildon, Essex in March 1973. He published a note in the popular electronics magazine Wireless World with a proposal to write to him if one liked the idea of having a Computer Club.  Activities  The primary way to support the members in their hobby was the ACC Newsletter (ACCN), with varied information pertinent to amateurs building, learning, using or just plainly interested in computers. The typewritten leaflet was published every 3 months starting with number 1 in March 1973. ACCN1 contained a description of the instruction set of a simple 10-bit computer designed by one of the first members: Ian Spencer. In August 1973 it mentions an offer to demonstrate a homemade copy of a PDP-8 made by John Florentin. This machine had been demonstrated earlier in March 1973 at a meeting of the Surrey Radio Contact club in Croydon. Mike published nearly anything that passed by or was sent to him, such as availability (and data sheets) of surplus and obsolete computer hardware, how to get free computer time on a university computer, latest price quotes for the newest chips (Intel 4004 and 8008, memory), algorithms, code tables etcetera. Through the members list of ACC many contacts were made, enabling members to write to and meet each other, which resulted in meetings in several places.  Current Status  The ACC does not exist any more. It is not known when and how it expired. The last symptoms known were that local chapters were forming in several British cities that seemed to operate independently of the ACC.  Other Clubs  The example of ACC was inspiring. In ACCN vol 2 iss 3 of August 1974, the start of a new club was announced: Association Française des Amateurs Constructeurs d´Ordinateurs (AFACO) by J-C Ribes in Meudon, France. In ACCN vol 5 iss 2 of June 1977, the start of a new club in Dutch language was announced: Hobby Computer Club (HCC) by Dick Barnhoorn, Leidschendam, Netherlands.

Music and lyrics  \\"If I Had No Loot\\" incorporates a new jack swing beat, pronounced guitar licks, and a tempo of 108 beats per minute. It has 1960s Stax southern soul influences. The song also contains vocal samples from hip hop songs, including the \\"da-da-da-day\\" chant from Boogie Down Productions' 1987 song \\"Remix for P Is Free\\" and the line \\"and you can new jack swing on my nuts!\\" from Ice Cube's 1991 song \\"The Wrong Nigga to Fuck Wit\\".

In Australia, the single reached number 12, spent 22 weeks in the top 100, and was certified gold.  Critical reception  Charles Aaron of Spin viewed the song as one of the group's best and called it \\"a splashy tour of 20th century American dance music—from jumpin' jazz to urban blues to '70s funk to hip hop.\\" Aaron found the Ice Cube sample \\"irrepressible\\", but felt that the hook is instead \\"how Dwayne Wiggins's swingin', bluesy guitar becomes its own break-beat. Meet the Meters of the '90s, straight up. The Brand New Heavies aren't even close.\\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited \\"If I Had No Loot\\" as a highlight on Sons of Soul.

History Grave of Rev. Roger Aitken, minister at St John's, 1782-1814, in the Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) The Episcopal congregation in Aberdeen that became St John's Church began when the Kirk of St Nicholas ejected Rev Dr George Garden in 1693 for refusing to conform to the Presbyterian Establishment. After a spell in exile, he returned to Aberdeen by 1720 and gathered around him the remnants of his flock.The Story of St John The Evangelist's Church, Aberdeen by W. Douglas Simpson M.A., D. Litt.1951, reprinted 2001 Over the next one hundred and thirty years, the congregation met in several houses and a larger building in Golden Square, dedicated to St John the Evangelist. Present Church During the long incumbency of Rev. Patrick Cheyne, a new building off Crown Street, was built to the designs of Mackenzie and Matthews, 1849-51. It was consecrated by the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Bishop William Skinner and opened for worship on 6 May 1851. The congregation has worshipped there continuously since. The church is now listed as category B by Historic Environment Scotland. CheyneSt John's Episcopal Church, Aberdeen was prosecuted in 1858 by Bishop Thomas Suther for his Tractarian \\"Six Sermons\\" on the Eucharist. His successor, the Rev. Frederick G Lee soon resigned to found a new congregation, St Mary's Carden Place, and the Patrons, Dr George Grub and Dr George Ogilvie beseeched John Comper to come to Aberdeen in 1861. During the first years of Comper's incumbency a day school was built, dedicated to Cheyne's forty years association with St John's, then in the year 1863 the first sister arrived from the Society of Saint Margaret,St Margaret's Gallowgate website the foundress of St Margaret's Convent, 17 Spital, Aberdeen.

Prelude  In 1465, Philip the Good had won the First Liège War against Prince-Bishop Louis de Bourbon, newly-appointed by himself. This had led to the humiliating Peace of Sint-Truiden. When Philip died in 1467, the people from Liège rose again against the hated Prince-Bishop, who fled the city. Liège counted on the promised military support from King Louis XI of France, also at war with the new Burgundian Duke Charles the Bold. Charles gathered an army of some 25.000 professional soldiers in Leuven and moved on Liège. Louis XI did nothing. The battle The army of Liège was composed of 12.000 civilians and 500 cavalry. They were commanded by Raes van Heers, his wife Pentecote d'Arkel, and Jean de Wilde, lord of Kessenich. Raes positioned his troops in the marshy area between Brustem, Sint-Truiden, and Ordingen to do battle. In this way he tried to diminish the effect of the Burgundian artillery. Charles came from the direction of Sint-Truiden, where he left a few thousand men behind, including 500 English archers, to prevent an intervention of the city's garrison. On 28 October, Charles ordered his vanguard under Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein to attack. Raes commanded his troops to hold position and wait for the arrival of reinforcements, but the militia from Tongeren counter- attacked nevertheless, and drove back the troops of Ravenstein, killing a considerable number of archers. But this was what Charles had been prepared for. His second line was armed with long two-handed swords, ideal for close combat. The Liège militia was quickly stopped in their advance and pushed back, in what soon became a rout. Raes van Heers and the French envoy François Royer, Baillif of Lyon, were amongst the first to flee the battlefield. The Burgundians killed everybody that fell into their hands. Liège suffered some 4,000 casualties and the rest of the army was only saved by the evening darkness.  Aftermath  After the battle, Charles moved on Liège and forced the city to surrender on 12 November. The Prince-Bishopric became a Burgundian protectorate under Guy of Humbercourt and all cities in the County of Loon were forced to remove their defences.

History Pre and During World War One Seaford House played host to St Peter's School in 1903, as an Edwardian Prep school when it was founded by Miss Maude Taylor in Crouch Lane.Not to be confused with Seaford House in London, although both were owned by Lord Howard de Walden at the time. Miss Taylor, who brought a small number of boys with her from an earlier school in Broadstairs, is recorded in the school history as having been a granddaughter of Dr Arnold of Rugby School. Her mother was Dr Arnold’s daughter Frances; her father the Rev Samuel Barnard Taylor. In 1907 it moved to a purpose built house designed and built by a Mr Morling and there it remained until 1982 when the school closed. On moving into the purpose-built school, Miss Taylor brought in two masters from St Peter's Broadstairs, Geoffrey Hellard and Oswald Wright, and became matron instead. Miss Taylor left in 1912 when Hellard married. In 1914 Rolf Henderson became the Headmaster and his portrait painted by his brother, Keith, a Scottish artist, hung in the school dining room. In many ways Rolf was the first true Headmaster of St Peter's. On 20 July 1915 the school playing fields were used to host a review of troops by Lord Kitchener. Kitchener mounted his horse in front of the school, and the boys gave such a loud patriotic cheer that the horse reared up, and almost dismounted its rider. Pre and During World War Two In 1934 Pat Knox-Shaw, who had joined the school in 1919 as second master, took over the reins as Headmaster on Rolf Henderson's retirement, With the support of Marjorie, his wife, Pat steered St Peter's through until 1955. In 1940, during the Second World War, St Peter's evacuated to The Nare Hotel in Veryan near Falmouth, Cornwall. It soon moved to Castle Hill, home of Lord and Lady Fortescue at Filleigh in North Devon until the end of the war, when in 1945 St Peter's moved back to its old home in Seaford, now vacated by the Army, and resumed normal service. After World War Two In 1955 Pat and Marjorie retired and Basil Talbot, an assistant Headmaster, a member of the team from the 1930s briefly took over but he retired through ill health. Michael Farebrother, another assistant Headmaster, took the helm and shortly after was joined by an old boy, Harry Browell who together with Serena his wife, ran St Peters until 1967 when Harry and Serena retired to Australia. The gap was filled by Mike's brother and sister-in-law, John and Margaret Farebrother who moved down from Malvern College where John was a senior housemaster. As times changed, and boarders began to be fewer, the age of the traditional prep school's days were numbered and that coupled with the age of the Farebrothers left no alternative but to close St Peters in the summer of 1982.The letter from the Farebrothers in May 1982 to old boys notifying them of the impending closure is on the Old Boys Association website. The school was well-equipped, with facilities for rugby (called rugger), football (called soccer until the late 1970s), tennis, cricket, hockey, squash, shooting, Eton fives, archery, climbing and swimming. A chapel, with windows by Goddard & Gibbs, was built from 1938 to 1940, and opened just before the school was requisitioned for the War. It has all been swept away. There was an auction and many of the contents were purchased by friends of the school. The war memorial in the Chapel is now in Seaford Museum, located in the Martello tower in the town. The buildings and grounds disappeared under a housing estate. What remains of the school are the large number of old boys many of whom meet at reunions in London held since 1990. They are members of The St Peter's Old Boys Association which has a web-site at St Peter’s, Seaford - www.stpetersseaford.org.uk. Mike Farebrother died in 1987, John Farebrother died in 1996 and his widow, Margaret Farebrother, died in 2006. In 2013 a retired teacher at the school, Christopher Jarvis, was convicted of sexually assaulting boys at St Peters in the 1970s. He was sentenced to eight years in prison. Jarvis taught at St Peters from 1962 to 1980, and at Bede's prep school in Eastbourne from 1982 to 2012.http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/10881510.Sussex_teacher_who_abused_boys_at_private_school_jailed_for_eight_years/ In 2015 he was convicted of further cases of sexually assaulting boys at St Peters from 1962 onwards.

Before puberty, both sexes have roughly similar vocal pitch, but during puberty the male voice typically deepens an octave, while the female voice usually deepens only by a few tones. A similar effect is a \\"voice crack\\", during which a person's voice suddenly and unintentionally enters a higher register (usually falsetto) for a brief period of time. This may be caused by singing or talking at a pitch outside the person's natural vocal range, stress, fatigue, emotional tension, or the physical changes associated with puberty. An instance of a voice crack (when associated with puberty) lasts for only a moment and generally occurs less frequently as a person grows into maturity.  Anatomical changes  Most of the voice change begins around puberty. Adult pitch is reached 2–3 years later but the voice does not stabilize until the early years of adulthood. It usually happens months or years before the development of significant facial hair. Under the influence of sex hormones, the voice box, or larynx, grows in both sexes. This growth is far more prominent in boys than in girls and is more easily perceived. It causes the voice to drop and deepen. Along with the larynx, the vocal folds (vocal cords) grow significantly longer and thicker. The facial bones begin to grow as well. Cavities in the sinuses, the nose, and the back of the throat grow bigger, thus creating more space within the head to allow the voice to resonate. Occasionally, voice change is accompanied by unsteadiness of vocalization in the early stages of untrained voices. Due to the significant drop in pitch to the vocal range, people may unintentionally speak in head voice or even strain their voices using pitches which were previously chest voice, the lowest part of the modal voice register.  History  Historical changes in the average age of puberty have had profound effects on the composing of music for children's voices. The composer Joseph Haydn (1732–1809) was known for typically singing parts in high pitches throughout his 17th year. Unchanged voices were in high demand for church choirs, which historically excluded women. The British cathedral choir ideal remains based on boy sopranos (or trebles), with the alto part executed by adult countertenors. But in German-speaking countries the alto parts as well are sung by boys. Historically, a strategy for avoiding the shift altogether was castration. Castrati are first documented in Italian church records from the 1550s.John Rosselli, \\"Castrato\\" article in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2001. Mozart's Exultate Jubilate, Allegri's Miserere and parts of Handel's Messiah were written for this voice, whose distinctive timbre was widely exploited in Baroque opera. In 1861 the practice of castration became illegal in Italy, and in 1878 Pope Leo XIII prohibited the hiring of new castrati by the church. The last castrato was Alessandro Moreschi (1858–1922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir.

Lynch was born in Collie, Western Australia to Ernest Lynch and Elizabeth Lynch (née Stewart). He was raised an Anglican and educated at state schools. He received his first musical training from Sister Monica at St Joseph's Convent in Boulder. In the early 1920s his talent as a violinist earned him a place in orchestras supporting silent movies and enabled him to perform solo recitals on the wireless. Joseph Nowotny became his mentor. The Rivervale Progress Association sponsored the first of a series of concerts to raise the £1000 needed to send Lynch to Belgium in 1923 to study under Emile Marchot at the Conservatoire Royal de Musique de Bruxelles for three and a half years. During his time in Belgium he was converted to Catholicism. Lynch began to study for the priesthood at Pontifical Urban College of Propaganda Fide, Rome in 1930. Lynch was ordained priest in St John Lateran Basilica on 16 March 1935. He returned to Western Australia where he was appointed curate of Palmyra in October 1935. In 1938 he formed an all-male choir at St Mary's Cathedral, Perth, which he conducted for fifteen years. In conjunction with Christian Brothers' College, St George's Terrace, he established Western Australia's first Catholic choir school. He served on the music examinations board of the University of Western Australia. He was the college chaplain of Aquinas College in Salter Point from 1938-1942. He was to become the founding parish priest of Applecross in 1952, which he dedicated to St. Benedict. In 1969 Lynch composed the \\"Parish congregational mass in honour of the unsung saints\\". Music from this mass has been used in most Sunday services by St James the Great, St Kilda East Anglican Church since soon after its composition. Lynch stayed at Applecross parish until he retired in 1973. Lynch died on 23 August 1976 at Applecross and was buried in Karrakatta Cemetery.

He was from the village of Wan, also known as Wan Tara Singh and Dall-Wan now in Amritsar district of the Eastern Punjab. Family background His father, S. Gurdas Singh, had received the rites of the Khalsa in the time of Guru Gobind Singh Sahib, and had taken part in the Battle of Amritsar (6 April 1709), in which Bhai Mani Singh led the Sikhs and in which Har Sahai, a revenue official of Patti, was killed at his (Gurdas Singh's) hands. Baba Gurdas Singh took martyrdom in Bajwara (Hoshiarpur) when he went along with Baba Banda Singh to fight for Sirhind. Baba Gurdas Singh was married in next village of Rajoke. Early life Bhai Tara Singh, the eldest of the five sons of Gurdas Singh, was born around 1687. He took Amrit from Bhai Mani Singh. Receiving the rites of initiation, he grew up to be a devout Sikh, skilled in the martial arts. Martyrdom As persistent persecution drove the Sikhs out of their homes to seek shelter in hills and forests, Tara Singh collected around him a band of desperadoes and lived defiantly at Wan, where he, according to Ratan Singh Bhangu's Pracheen Panth Prakash, possessed ajag'Iror landgrant. In his vaar or enclosure made with thick piles of dried branches of thorny trees, he gave refuge to any Sikh who came to him to escape persecution. The faujdar sent a contingent of 25 horse and 80 foot to Wan but Tara Singh's colleague Sardar met them in the fields, fought back and routed the invaders with several dead, including their commander, nephew of the faujdar and got martyrdom himself. Ja'far Begh reported the matter to Zakariya Khan, who sent a punitive expedition consisting of 2,000 horse, 5 elephants, 40 light guns and 4 cannononwheels under his deputy, Momin Khan. Tara Singh had barely 22 men with him at that time. They kept the Lahore force at bay through the night but were killed to a man in the handtohand fight on the following day 1726. Their heads were taken back to Lahore and thrown in blind well where Gurudwara Shaheed Singhania now stands in Landa Bazar.

Biography Commodore SID chip Robert Yannes graduated from Villanova University in 1978. He started out as an electronic music hobbyist before being hired as a chip designer at MOS Technology which had become a part of Commodore. Al Charpentier recruited Yannes partly for his music synthesis knowledge. He has been infatuated by electronic music since the early 1970s. He claims the song Lucky Man by Emerson, Lake & Palmer influenced him more than any other single song, and also lists Kraftwerk and Mike Oldfield among his influences. He designed the MicroPET with help from Al Charpentier which became an unintended prototype for the Commodore VIC-20 home computer. He designed the single-chip sound synthesizer voice chip SID (6581) with enough resolution to produce high-quality music. However, he was unable to refine the signal-to-noise ratio which he desired. He hoped the chip would find its way into polyphonic/polytimbral synthesizers. The SID chip was his first attempt at a phase-accumulating oscillator, the heart of all Wavetable- lookup synthesis. After he left MOS Technology he co-founded Ensoniq in 1982. The Ensoniq sound chips had multiplexed oscillators designed in such a way that it was possible to produce more voices per chip, typically 32 for Ensoniq's DOC, OTIS, and OTTO sound chips. Given less time constraints than for the SID chip design, a proper MOS op-amp could be implemented to eliminate signal leakage and an improved filter to achieve high resonance. Current designs include waveform interpolation, digital filters, and digital effects.stud1.tuwien.ac.at - Interview with Bob Yannes, 1996-08-30  References  Commodore people Computer hardware engineers Living people 1957 births ","title":"Robert Yannes"},{"id":"34308126","text":"Sir Edward Montagu (c. 1530 – 26 January 1602) was an English landowner and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1559.

The expedition traversed the states of Vengi, Kalinga, Odda and Bengal culminating with their arrival at the Ganges river. The Chola victory over the Pala king Mahipala I is considered to be the climax of the expedition. In 1019 CE, Rajendra’s forces marched through Kalinga towards the river Ganga.

Rajaraja Narendra appealed for help from his maternal uncle, the Chola emperor, Rajendra Chola I who sent a large force under his general, Araiyan Rajarajan, a veteran of the Chalukya-Chola Wars. Araiyan Rajarajan defeated Vijayaditya and after driving him out, firmly established Rajaraja Narendra on the Eastern Chalukya throne. Following this victory, Rajendra Chola I led an expedition northwards supported by an advance guard led by Araiyan Rajarajan, to punish the kings of Kalinga and Odda who had sided with Vijayaditya in the succession dispute.  Events  The Thiruvalangadu plates state: Rajendra Chola I defeated the kings of Kalinga and Odda and marched up to the Godavari River, from where Araiyan Rajarajan led an army into Bengal.

Sakkarakottam, the place from where Araiyan Rajarajan led the campaign into Bengal is identified with the town of Chakrakotya or Chitrakoot, in the present-day Madhya Pradesh.Sastri, p 208 Masunidesam, Maduraimandalam, Namanaikkonam and Pancapalli, too, are believed to be located to the north-west of Vengi. Following the conquest of these places in present-day Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Araiyan Rajarajan invaded Odda (present-day Orissa) and conquered it after defeating its ruler Indraratha. His next success was against Dharmapala, who ruled the kingdom of Dandabhukti located in the marshland between Orissa and Bengal.Sastri, p 209 Rajarajan, then, defeated Ranasura, the ruler of Lada or Radha, identified as the part of West Bengal south of the Ganges River and Govindacharya of Vangala, located further to the east before confronting the Pala ruler Mahipala I. After defeating Mahipala in a pitched battle, Araiyan Rajarajan reached the Ganges and took some water with him on his journey back. He was met by Rajendra I on the banks of the Godavari and the combined armies returned home after conducting Rajaraja Narendra's coronation as the king of the Eastern Chalukyas.Sastri, p 210  Nature of the expedition  There have been general disagreement among historians on the nature of the expedition. Early scholars such as V. Venkayya interpreted Rajendra Chola's campaign to \\"bring the waters of the Ganges into Chola territory\\" as a pilgrimage to the Ganges River. However, this theory has been refuted by later historians, most notable among them being K. A. Nilakanta Sastri. That the campaign was military in nature is suggested by the last line of the Thiruvalangadu plates which state that the king erected a Ganga-jalamayam jayasthambham or a \\"liquid pillar of victory\\" in the form of the Cholaganga tank.  Effects  The Chola expedition to the Ganges had a long-lasting influence. According to R. D. Banerji, a Kannadiga chief who accompanied Araiyan Rajarajan on his campaign settled down in Bengal and founded the Sena Dynasty. It is believed that the Karnata people of Mithila, too, might have descended from soldiers in the Chola army. The Siddhantasaravali of Trilocana Sivacharya claims that a large number of Saivite Brahmins from Bengal were taken to the Chola country where they were granted lands by Rajendra Chola I. They, eventually, settled down in Kanchipuram and the Cauvery Delta forming the Sivacharya community.

Over 180 people were killed. Background Boko Haram, a militant group based in Borno State whose goal is to institute sharia law on all of Nigeria, has become more proficient in carrying out attacks since a 2009 clash with security forces that led to the death of its leader Ustaz Mohammed Yusuf. Since then it has either claimed or been blamed for numerous attacks on Nigerian government and civilian targets. Most attacks have been the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, though the group's name has been called out in other bombings such as the attacks against the United Nations HQ and the main police building in the capital city of Abuja. The group itself has since factionalised with some allied to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and some expecting terms of agreement similar to southern Nigeria's MEND. On 25 December 2011, Boko Haram also bombed a church in Abuja and attacked other Christian targets in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram had previously given all Christians 3 days to leave Yobe State and Borno State following the Christmas bombings. The President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, had declared a state of emergency in several towns of those states. 5–6 January attacks Militants armed with automatic weapons stormed a town hall in the city of Mubi in Adamawa State where people had gathered to mourn 3 Christians shot on the previous evening. At least 18 people were confirmed killed by a Nigerian Red Cross official, and a separate ambush of Christians leaving a church service in the state capital of Yola left at least eight people dead. Most of the victims were ethnic Igbo. Later in the day a spokesman for Boko Haram calling himself Abu Qaqa claimed responsibility for these two incidents and the shooting during a church service in Gombi that killed six people on Thursday. A Christian couple were also gunned down in Maiduguri, considered to be the stronghold of the radical group. Police in Yobe State later told the press they were engaged in street battles with members of Boko Haram. Hundreds of Christians started fleeing northern cities in the aftermath of the bombings and church officials urged people not to take part in revenge attacks. 20 January attacks On 20 January after Friday prayers, a group of gunmen in police uniforms entered five police buildings and freed all of the inmates. They proceeded to bomb the buildings, as well as two immigration offices and the local office of the State Security Service in Kano. They later drove around the city in cars and motorcycles, shooting pedestrians and battling with police. Amongst the dead was television reporter Enenche Akogwu, shot while covering the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Boko Haram dropped letters written in Hausa at the site of the attacks, announcing that they were protesting the continued detention of Boko Haram members. They also directly contacted the press to claim responsibility for the attacks. Officials in the city responded by setting a curfew and by initiating armed patrols of major streets, though sporadic gunfire was still heard the next day. The Kano State government ordered all hospitals in the area to treat victims free of charge. African Union chairman Jean Ping condemned the attacks and said that the Union \\"rejects terrorism in all its forms;\\" and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks as well. On 23 January the government announced the death toll had risen to 185 people, 150 of whom were civilians and at least 32 police officers, including 3 members of the secret police. Local security forces announced they had found 10 unexploded car bombs and almost 300 smaller homemade bombs around the city. The Emir of Kano Ado Bayero and Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso then led a prayer for the victims of the attacks. According to the website 247reports.com, a Boko Haram spokesman indicated that the attacks were carried out due to a failure by the state governments to pay protection money.

The group currently consists of four Burmese women: Ah Moon, Cha Cha, Htike Htike (pronounced as \\"Tie Tie\\"), and Kimi. The girls released their first cover album in 2010, \\"Year of the Tiger Girls.\\" In 2011, the group split from Kyaw and was renamed as the \\"Me N Ma Girls.In 2016, the group renamed again \\"Me N Ma Girls\\" to \\"MyaNmar Girls\\" As The Me N Ma Girls grew in popularity, their views regarding censorship and other social issues took center stage. The Group entered the international stage and gained notoriety when they debuted their country's first overtly political song Come Back Home, in May 2012 during a visit from then United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues Melanne Verveer in the Office on Global Women's Issues. Shortly after their appearance, their story was made into a documentary, Miss Nikki and the Tiger Girls, and was directed by the award-winning director, Juliet Lamont. The group signed with the independent American music label, Power Music of Los Angeles, California — the first for any pop and hip hop band from Myanmar. History Formation and the Tiger Girls Me N Ma Girls in their traditional Burmese attire. The Tiger Girls were formed as a result of a talent competition sponsored by Australian dancer Nicole \\"Nikki\\" May and Burmese entrepreneur U Moe Kyaw. In January 2010, May auditioned 120 women at the 50th Street Bar in Yangon. Five young ladies, Ah Moon, Cha Cha, Htike Htike, Kimi and Wai Hnin were chosen and formed the original group. They debuted eight weeks later on the main stage at Thingyan, Myanmar's New Year's Festival. The college educated young women come from different areas in Myanmar. Ah Moon, from Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin State, earned a degree in Russian from Yangon University of Foreign Languages; Kimi from Chin State, earned a degree in mathematics at Dagon University in Yangon; Cha Cha, from the Yangon area earned a degree in Zoology from Dagon University; Htike Htike, from the Yangon area, earned a graphic design degree from University of Computer Studies, Yangon and Wai Hnin, Yangon earned a degree in chemistry from University of East Yangon (Tarwa). The Tiger Girls adopted stage names that embodied their own character and style. The Group's stage names are \\"Chilli\\" (Kimi), \\"Tricky\\" (Wai Hnin), \\"Missy\\" (Cha Cha), \\"Electro\\" (Htike Htike) and \\"Baby\\" (Ah Moon). The Group released their first CD, Year of the Tiger Girl, in July 2010. The CD included cover tunes called copy tracks, which are western pop songs rewritten in Burmese. Their early performances followed traditional K-Pop style, a popular form of music originating from South Korea. After the release of their first CD, the Tigers Girls gained popularity in Yangon, but received criticism for their unconventional appearance and performance style. May deliberately selected young ladies who challenged the popular K-Pop mold by choosing young women who were the \\"atypical doll-like girl band\\" made popular in Asian culture, a concept not shared by co-founder Kyaw. Artistic and fundamental differences regarding the direction of the Group resulted in the dissolution of the business partnership between May and Kyaw. Ultimately, the Tiger Girls followed May and renamed themselves \\"Me N Ma Girls,\\" a play on their country's name, Myanmar. Transition to Me N Ma Girls Me N Ma Girls live at the Thingyan New Year's Festival in Yangon in April 2012. The group's transformation from the Tiger Girls to Me N Ma Girls coincided with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's historic trip to Myanmar in December 2011, which helped foster sweeping democratic reforms in the country, most notably in the area of censorship. On December 17, 2011, the band released their second album Mingalarpar, which means \\"welcome\\" in Burmese. Eleven of the tracks are originals, with collaborations from local artists San Pee, J-Me and Ar-T, as well as their manager, May. The lone cover song is a Myanmar favorite composed four decades ago by Alinka Kyaw Swar Shwe Pyi Aye. Myanmar conducted a historic Burmese by-elections of April 2012, in which pro-democracy icon and national hero Daw Aung San Suu Kyi ran for political office. In response, the Me N Ma Girls began writing their country's first overtly political song, \\"Come Back Home.\\" The song was directed at the 10% of the population, about a half million people, who left Myanmar due to repression and poverty. \\"Come Back Home\\" was first performed in May 2012 at a private lunch with former United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues from the Office of Global Women's Issues, Melanne Verveer, upon her visit to Myanmar. In her speech, Former Ambassador Verveer remarked, \\"I thought that it was a fitting ending to this trip that I just have been privileged to take to be able to hear young people sing out so eloquently for a new day, a new day that they want to have and they want to see realized in their country.\\" =Change of music trends in Myanmar= The music scene in Myanmar continued to change with the lifting of censorship regulations. According to Heather MacLachlan, a professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio and author of the book \\"Burma's Pop Music Industry: Creators, Distributors, Censors\\", the struggle for women's rights, especially in the music industry, goes beyond the censors: \\"It's not just the censors, I mean, those are Burmese values.\\" \\"I've NEVER seen girls behave like that, ever.\\" Only a handful of venues are permitted to host concerts in general in Myanmar with women playing in bars often being equated to the sex industry. The Me N Ma Girls did not intentionally set out to revolutionize the image of modern Burmese women but by choosing bold outfits, sharp dance moves, and hip hop rhythms for their live appearances shattered stereotypes of women in Myanmar. However, with ever-changing censorship regulations, the group continue to be on target with the movement. The group wrote, \\"Soft-rock ballads and big power ballads still dominate mainstream, but the young people are beginning to embrace pop, R&B; and hip-hop. Bands are realizing the need to write original music rather than doing ripped versions of international tracks. Freedom of expression is coming alive. Indie rockers, punks, drum-and-bass DJs, dubstep DJs and some great dance producers are emerging.\\" Record deal with Power House Music and international exposure The Me N Ma Girls in the Summer of 2012. The “Me N Ma Girls” continued to expand their artistic identity during performances and through their compositions by taking risks uncommon for women in the music scene in Myanmar. The Group travelled outside Myanmar to Bangkok, Thailand in 2011 and Singapore in 2012. As their exposure in the region increased, the Group caught to the eye of a record executive in the United States. In June 2012, the Group signed with Dan Hubbert, owner of American record production company Power House Music of Los Angeles. The Group travelled to the United States for the first time and spent time in Los Angeles recording their first Western-pop style and single, entitled \\"Girl Strong.\\" During the trip, the Group performed at the closing performance of the Women in the World Summit in New York City. The Me N Ma Girls continued their international travel and returned to Singapore to perform at the quarterfinals of the 2012 Singapore Cup, and the Music Matters Live Festival, which include a special performance for the delegates at the event. The Group also participated in the Chime for Change campaign sponsored by Gucci, which focused on change for girls and women across the world in education, justice and health. In July 2013, Wai Hnin left the Group due to greater family responsibilities. Remaining members Ah Moon, Cha Cha, Hitke Hitke and Kimi decided not to replace Wai Hnin and continued with plans to expand their international presence on the music scene. The Group returned to Los Angeles in August 2013 to film the music video for \\"Girl Strong,\\" and an exclusive release of the song \\"Someday\\" on iTunes specifically to benefit the Worldwide Orphans Foundation, an organization that addresses the medical and developmental conditions of children living in orphanages abroad. In September 2013, the “Me N Ma Girls” were featured in SBS Dateline Australia story on the changes happening in Myanmar. \\"The Road to Democracy\\" story featured the Group who talked about the freedom opening up for their generation and their success in the United States. After leaving the United States, the Me N Ma Girls traveled back to Thailand and performed on Women to Women and The Morning Show. After Thailand, the group headed to Hong Kong for interviews on RTHK's The Morning Brew, Teen Time and Bangkok's DJ Momay's Show, EAZY 105. In January 2014, members Htike Htike and Cha Cha also left the group, due to a contractual dispute. According to their agreement with Power House Music, all of their solo work would also be owned by the company. Rather than accept this, both women decided to leave the group to better focus on solo careers of their own. Ah Moon and Kimi plan to go forward with releasing a Me N Ma Girls album later in 2014.Nyein, Nyein (January 28, 2014). \\"After Split, Me N Ma Girls Continue With US-Recorded Album\\" The Irrawaddy Retrieved February 16, 2014.

Humphreys was a right-handed batsman who fielded as a wicket- keeper. He was born at Brighton, Sussex. Humphreys made his first-class debut for Sussex against Surrey at The Oval in 1869. He played infrequently for Sussex over the next seventeen years, making 31 further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against Surrey at the County Ground, Hove, in 1886. Described in his 1896 obituary in Wisden as a \\"fair bat\\", Humphreys scored a total of 545 runs in his 32 matches, which came at an average of 10.28. He passed fifty just once in his career, making 58 against Lancashire in 1869. In the field he took 20 catches and made 3 stumpings. Outside of county cricket, he worked as the cricket coach at Brighton College from 1871 to 1872. In 1874 he was recorded as living at 177 Edward Street, Brighton, where he worked as a shoe maker. The 1881 census has him recorded living at 14 Preston Road, Brighton, still working as a shoe maker, though by this time widowed and with two young children.

In December 2009, the defendant, a male escort named Michael Peacock, had been charged by the Metropolitan Police for selling hardcore gay pornography that the police believed had the ability to \\"deprave or corrupt\\" the viewer, which was illegal under the Obscene Publications Act. He was subsequently acquitted through a trial by jury in January 2012. At the time, Peacock was the only individual to have successfully pleaded 'not guilty' under the Act in a case involving the kind of gay BDSM pornography which he published. Legal experts said that, following the case, the Obscene Publications Act now \\"made no sense\\". It was also notable as one of the early cases in the English courts where live tweeting was a significant source of reporting and publicising the deliberations of the case following the 14 December 2011 guidance from the Lord Chief Justice which allowed tweeting in English Courts. Details of the case Arrest and charge The man at the centre of the trial was Michael Peacock (born 6 September 1958), an independent male escort who had been operating in the profession since November 2004. A former railway worker, Peacock decided to enter the sex industry in his mid-40s. At the time of the police investigation, Peacock advertised his services on his own personal website, entitled \\"Sleazy Michael\\", and also advertised hardcore pornographic DVDs for sale on the Craigslist website. Some of these DVDs included films which featured extreme sexual acts between men, such as BDSM (whipping, staged kidnapping and rape play), fisting and urolagnia. While these acts were themselves not illegal in the United Kingdom at the time, the Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command of the Metropolitan Police considered such DVDs illegal under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959, which prohibited the sale of materials that could \\"deprave and corrupt\\" the viewer. In January 2009 they sent an undercover police officer to purchase some of these DVDs from Peacock at his home in Finsbury Park, North London. On 14 December 2009, the Metropolitan Police charged Peacock with six counts under the Obscene Publications Act 1959. If found guilty he could have faced a five-year prison sentence. Trial After being postponed twice, the trial began on 2 January 2012, at Southwark Crown Court in South London. The prosecution claimed that several of the scenes featured in the pornographic DVDs which Peacock sold had the ability to \\"deprave and corrupt\\" the viewer and as such were illegal. They suggested that the customers purchasing the DVDs had not been aware of their extreme content, a claim Peacock denied, asserting that those purchasing the pornography \\"asked me for specific titles or niches, and knew exactly what they were getting\\". Peacock's defence was conducted by the law firm Hodge Jones & Allen. His defence solicitor Nigel Richardson described his client as being a well-known member of the London gay community, and remarked that \\"The whole idea of something being depraved or corrupt is outdated.\\" Another of the advocates for the defence, Myles Jackman, tweeted throughout the trial, using the hashtag of #obscenitytrial, and through Twitter helped to build up an online support base for Peacock. Jackman recognised it as having important implications for UK law, noting that the verdict would \\"ultimately clarify the law on the representation\\" of specialist sexual acts such as BDSM and urolagnia. During the trial, the defence called for expert evidence from academics studying sex and the media. The jury, of both men and women, were shown several hours of footage from Peacock's DVDs - including images on BDSM, urolagnia and a man being punched in the testicles - in an attempt to decide whether they could \\"deprave or corrupt\\" the viewer. Richardson later related that although \\"they were quite shocked initially, they started to look quite bored very quickly\\". During the trial, the court had repeatedly warned the jury not to convict on any \\"impulse of homophobic disgust\\" that they might have regarding the acts taking place in the DVDs. After four days, the trial came to an end on 6 January 2012. In summing up the case, the Recorder James Dingemans QC stated that the jury must decide whether the pornography did breach the Act, and noted that \\"in a civilised society, lines must be drawn\\". It subsequently took the jury two hours to come to a verdict of \\"not guilty\\", deciding that the scenes depicted in the DVDs were unable to deprave or corrupt any viewer watching them. Nigel Richardson later told the press that the jury had recognised that the pornography found in the DVDs would only be seen by \\"gay men specifically asking for this type of material\\" and not by the general public. Aftermath Legal experts said that officers from SCD9, the specialist team within the Metropolitan Police, would be meeting with the Crown Prosecution Service (the prosecuting legal authority in England) and the British Board of Film Classification (responsible for film and DVD control and censorship) to review their guidelines following the jury's decision. Specialist lawyers said the ruling may change the material that adult film producers will make and supply. Sex worker turned writer Brooke Magnanti said the publishing industry would be relieved by the outcome of the case. When asked if he felt he had suffered any homophobia during the experience, Peacock denied it, stating that \\"Personally, I didn't feel there was any homophobic angle to the questioning, either by the arresting officers or in court. And full credit to the jury. I noticed a distinct change in their reactions over the course of the trial.\\" Defense solicitor Myles Jackman claimed that the verdict had been \\"a significant victory for common sense\\". He considered the trial to be the \\"most significant in a decade\\", believing that it \\"could be the final nail in the coffin for the Obscene Publications Act in the digital age because the jury's verdict shows that normal people view consensual adult pornography as a part of everyday life and are no longer shocked, depraved or corrupted by it\\". Jackman had been responsible for maintaining the Twitter account devoted to the trial, and following the verdict, a flurry of Twitter users tweeted in support of Peacock, many criticising the fact that the case ever came to court in the first place. Various experts in the field of sex and pornography claimed that the trial was significant because it reflected that the general British public understood sexuality in a new way, something that the law at the time didn't take into account. The academic sexologist Feona Attwood of Sheffield Hallam University, who herself had attended the trial, claimed that \\"I think the law does not make sense. All the evidence that was heard was about whether the material had the ability to harm and corrupt. The question now is, what does that actually mean? What is significant is that the jury understood [the issues at stake].\\" The conservative pressure group Mediawatch-uk argued that the trial reflected a need to make the Obscene Publications Act more specific; the group's director Vivienne Pattison claimed that the R v Peacock case \\"illustrates the problem\\" with the law as it stood, noting that \\"There is not a list which says what is obscene and what is not. It makes it incredibly difficult to get a conviction on that\\". In response to the events of the trial she argued that while \\"As a society we are moving to a place where porn is considered as kind of fun between consenting adults,\\" she felt that this was problematic because in her opinion \\"porn is damaging.\\" Media response Writing for The Guardian, Nichi Hodgson proclaimed that the verdict represented \\"a great day for English sexual liberties\\", proceeding to state \\"Thank god the jury had sense to see that in 2012, telling others what is depraved – and prosecuting them for \\"debasing\\" your mind if they publish material featuring it and you are privy to it, is as absurd as it is anachronistic.\\"  Further reading  * PDF.

It is known from a single specimen collected on a guyot in the Coral Sea between Australia and New Caledonia. It is thought to be an active predator with colour vision, unlike its nearest living relative, Neoglyphea inopinata. Description Laurentaeglyphea is known from a single adult female specimen, with a carapace in size. In life, the animal is whitish and marked with red patches, especially on the abdomen and the distal segments of the first pereiopods; the markings are much fainter on the carapace. Laurantaeglyphea has large reniform (kidney-shaped) eyes, more developed in the lower half than the upper. The epistome, behind the two pairs of antennae on the ventral side, is large, but considerably shorter than that of Neoglyphea. Laurantaeglyphea has five pairs of pereiopods, all without true chelae (claws). Distribution The single known specimen of Laurentaeglyphea was collected at a depth of on Banc Capel (Chesterfield Plateau; ) in the Coral Sea. Ecology The ecology of Laurentaeglyphea is very different from that of its closest living relative, Neoglyphea inopinata. Banc Capel is a guyot – a former atoll with steep sides and a flat top – and is swept by strong currents. There are no sandy or muddy substrates, the surface being occupied by rocks or gravel scree. It is dominated by sponges, including the genus Phloedictyon and gorgonians. Other decapods found in the same trawls including the slipper lobster Ibacus brucei, the crab Randallia and swimming crabs. On the basis of its large eyes, Laurentaeglyphea is thought to be an active predator, perhaps one with similar hunting behaviour to that of stomatopods. The presence of patterned pigmentation on an animal that lives at a depth of around suggests that it does not live in a burrow. In the clear waters of the Coral Sea, sufficient light penetrates to these depths for a wide range of colours to be represented among the fauna. The eyes of Laurentaeglyphea are thought to be adapted to colour vision, even if it is biased towards the shorter wavelengths (blues and greens). The collected specimen of Laurentaeglyphea was observed to be very active and aggressive, using its semichelate first pereiopods to attack. Taxonomy Laurentaeglyphea neocaledonica was originally described by Bertrand Richer de Forges in 2006, on the basis of a single specimen (the holotype). He named the species Neoglyphea neocaledonica, where the specific epithet ' refers to New Caledonia, the nearest land to the site where the holotype was collected. Later that year, Jacques Forest erected the new genus Laurentaeglyphea for the new species, separating it from Neoglyphea inopinata, the only other species in the genus Neoglyphea. The genus name Laurentaeglyphea commemorates Michèle de Saint Laurent, who had discovered and co-described the first Recent specimen of the infraorder Glypheidea. The two species of living glypheids are considered \\"living fossils\\".

The company was founded by **Ken Fischer** (May 12, 1945 – December 23, 2006) in 1985. Trainwreck amplifiers are made in Colonia, New Jersey and are among the most sought-after amplifiers on the market. History Ken Fischer began working on electronics in the US Navy, and then repaired TVs and radios, and then got a job building amplifiers at Ampeg, where he became senior engineer. Disillusioned, he left in 1967 when the company was being sold to Magnavox. When Fischer set out on his own, he started building boutique amplifiers with custom wood cabinets, rare new old stock (NOS) components, and custom-built transformers. His early clients included Mark Knopfler and Eddie Van Halen. He made the first Trainwreck amp in his shop in New Jersey, in late 1982/early 1983. With inspiration from Atlantic Records Caspar McCloud the amp was named 'Ginger' after Caspar's wife. His first amps (later named \\"Liverpool 30\\") were based on the 4 × EL84 configuration of the Vox AC30. \\"In beautiful wood cabinetry that matched their legendary sound,\\" They were made to order in limited numbers, and are \\"ultra- rare and highly collectible\\". Lacking serial numbers, they are individually designated with women's names; the one owned by guitarist and producer Matte Henderson is called \\"Nancy\\". The last one he built (\\"Kaylene\\"), while suffering from chronic fatigue immune dysfunction, was an Express made from an old leftover chassis. In 1998, his health declining, Fischer partnered with Komet Amps in Louisiana to further develop his circuitry. This culminated in several acclaimed designs, including what would become Komet's flagship amplifier: the Komet 60. In his final years, Ken Fischer would collaborate with Dr. Z Amplification on the, \\"Z-Wreck.\\" The Z-Wreck is a Vox AC30-style amp that was originally made for country guitar player, Brad Paisley. Fischer's final design, the Songwriter 30, was licensed under Komet Amps. It features four cathode-biased EL84/6BQ5 output tubes and two 12AX7 preamp tubes. The amp's name is derived from its distinct clean sound, which Fischer felt was welt-suited for singer-songwriters. Both amplifiers are still in production by their respective manufacturers. Ken Fischer died from complications due to chronic illness in 2006. **John Mark** (colloquially known as **JM** ), who was Ken's longtime friend and co-builder, decided to continue building amps under the Trainwreck name. Production of Trainwreck Amps resumed in 2009 with permission from Fischer's family. They are still made in Ken's workshop using his exact specifications. Original Fischer-built Trainwreck amplifiers are known to fetch $25,000 and up. The amps are praised for the simplicity of their design and their touch sensitivity: \\"The sound's so immediate from the pick to coming out of the amp, [which] opens up a whole new kind of playing\\", according to Charles Daughtry (Kaylene's owner, who sold all his Dumbles to build a collection of six Trainwrecks). Design Ken Fischer designed and built his amps solely as amp heads, not combos. This was done to prolong the service life of the vacuum tubes. Trainwreck amplifiers are housed in their signature polished wood cabinets. By customer request, a custom engraving can be added to the control panel. The amps notably lack a carrying handle; an aesthetic choice made by Ken. They also lack normal serial numbers, instead being engraved with a female name. Trainwreck amplifiers are renowned for their dynamic overdrive sound and response. They can deliver a wide range of clean signals and high-gain overdrive solely with the manipulation of the guitar's volume knob. All Trainwreck amps have five control knobs (volume, treble, mid, bass, presence). Models All amps are individually made: \\"it's possible that no two Trainwreck amplifiers actually have the exact same circuit\\". They are usually equipped with three 12AX7 preamp tubes. Fischer made three kinds of models: *Express; two EL34 or two 6V6 output tubes. Two 12AX7 preamp tubes and one 12AX7 phase inverter. (Highest-gain amplifier in the lineup. Tonally reminiscent of the Marshall Plexi) *Liverpool; four EL84 output tubes. Two 12AX7 preamp tubes and one 12AX7 phase inverter. *Rocket; four EL84 output tubes and a 5AR4 rectifier tube. Two 12AX7 preamp tubes and one 12AX7 phase inverter (Based on the Top- Boost channel of the Vox AC30) Trainwreck also offers half-power versions of each amp model.
