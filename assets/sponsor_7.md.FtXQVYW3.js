Olsen, Benjamin Franklin's Vision of American Community, 2004, p. xiii). (22 September 1725 - 1 April 1802) was a French painter known for the clarity and immediacy of his portraits. He was born in Carpentras, near Avignon, into a family with an artistic bent and received his first training from his father, a surgeon and talented amateur. He subsequently studied with Joseph Gabriel Imbert (1666‚Äì1749), who had been a pupil of Charles Le Brun. From 1744‚Äì47 or later he worked in Rome, in the atelier of Pierre Subleyras (1699‚Äì1749), who was also from the south of France. In Italy Duplessis became fast friends with Joseph Vernet, another Occitan. He returned to Carpentras, spent a brief time in Lyon then arrived about 1752 in Paris, where he was accepted into the Acad√©mie de Saint-Luc and exhibited some portraits, which were now his specialty, in 1764, but did not achieve much notice until his exhibition of ten paintings at the Paris salon of 1769, very well received and selected for special notice by Denis Diderot; the Acad√©mie de peinture et de sculpture accepted him in the category of portraitist, considered a lesser category at the time. He continued to exhibit at the Paris salons, both finished paintings and sketches, until 1791, and once more, in 1801. His portrait of the Dauphine in 1771 and his appointment as a peintre du Roi assured his success: most of his surviving portraits date from the 1770s and 1780s. He received privileged lodgings in the Galeries du Louvre. In the Revolution, he withdrew to safe obscurity at Carpentras during the Reign of Terror. Afterwards, from 1796, he served as curator at the newly founded museum formed at Versailles, so recently emptied of its furnishings at the Revolutionary sales. His uncompromising self-portrait at this time of his life is at Versailles, where he died. He would adjust his style to the social condition of his sitter: his portrait of Charles-Claude, comte d'Angiviller, director of the B√¢timents du Roi, is as distant and conventional as his state portrait of Louis XVI in coronation robes (1776),The original disappeared, but has been identified in the Mus√©e Ingres, Montauban (ref Minist√®re ). while his realistic and intimate portrait of the opera composer Christoph Willibald Gluck (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) catches the composer at the keyboard in a moment of inspiration and his penetrating portrait of the sculptor Christophe Gabriel Allegrain (Louvre Museum, illustration) shows him having just laid down his chisel: this was the morceau de reception that gained him admittance to the Acad√©mie. His portrait of Benjamin Franklin (circa 1785), more than any other, has fixed the image of Franklin for posterityDuplessis received many commissions for duplicates: one is at the National Portrait Gallery, London; another at the North Carolina Museum of Art. since it is reproduced on the U.S. hundred dollar bill.

All that remains of this station now is the platform mound, however the track is still in reasonable condition. Between 1999 and 2008 there was constant speculation that the railway line beyond Cranbourne to Leongatha could re-open as promised by the Victorian State Government, under a project named 'Bringing Trains Back to Victorians'. However, in May 2008, a scoping study carried out on behalf of the State Government found the costs of returning services were high, at $72 million. Therefore, plans to reopen the line were halted, and the Government will spend $14.2 million on improved V/Line coach services instead. Further, there are plans in motion to turn the railway reservation into a Rail Trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora In 2013, as part of Public Transport Victoria's Network Development Plan for Metropolitan Rail, an extension of the Cranbourne line to Clyde was earmarked to begin in the \\"long-term\\", which would equate to at least over 20 years into the future.

Background and Early Career Born Norman John Klugmann, in 1912 in Hampstead, he later adopted the name James. His father was a tobacco pipe merchant, the family lived on Haverstock Hill, Hampstead, London. His sister Kitty Cornforth was also a committed Communist, marrying Maurice Cornforth. Harry Hodson, in his memoirs, recalls visiting the Klugmann family home and recounts of James Klugmann, that \\"his background was impeccably bourgeois.\\" Educated at The Hall School, Hampstead, Gresham's School and Trinity College, Cambridge (at both of which he was a friend and contemporary of the spy Donald Maclean), Klugman joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in 1933 whilst studying at Cambridge, where he won a double first. Klugmann was at pains to deny any connection with spying during his lifetime and a long period of secret service surveillance on him threw up no obvious proof. He had however been on the fringes of such activity, which no doubt gave rise to suspicion, along with his university friendships of some of those who were involved in espionage. With the defection of Vasili Mitrokhin it was revealed that Klugmann was a KGB agent, under the codename MER, who was instrumental in recruiting the Cambridge Five.The Mitrokhin Archive Vol.I pg. 82-85 In 1935, Klugmann gave up an academic career to become Secretary of the World Student Association, based in Paris, travelling widely across the world. This role, which involved the building of the Popular Front against fascism, first attracted the attention of the British Security Service (MI5). The Service's description of James for its operatives, which was put on file around 1938, said: \\"Height about , light build, broad brow, small featured face, fuzz of greyish hair, probably wears glasses, not remarkably Jewish but rather foreign appearance.\\" In 1936 Klugmann met Arnold Deutsch, the head of recruitment for NKVD agents based in England. Deutsch's main objective was to get Klugmann to help recruit John Cairncross as a spy. Klugmann became an important figure in the network. However, as he was known to the police as an active member of the Communist Party of Great Britain meant that he was not used as a spy. However, he was given the codename MAYOR and was used to compile reports on other agents.Biography of James Klugmann Deutsch reported to Moscow: \\"Mayor (James Klugmann) is a party functionary who devotes himself entirely to the party. He is a quiet and thoughtful man. Modest, conscientious, industrious and serious. Everybody who knows him likes him and respects him‚Ä¶. He is known to the British police as an active communist. He is used to legal work and therefore incautious. But if his attention is drawn to this he will act as required.\\" Arnold Deutsch, report on James Klugmann (April 1937) Career in Yugoslavia with Special Operations He had joined the Royal Army Service Corps as a private in 1940 but, having a natural flair for languages, he was soon transferred to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), who apparently ignored his communist sympathies. It was claimed by the official historian of SOE that when Klugmann was recruited into SOE by Brigadier Terence Airey (an old boy of his school), MI5 reported that he was not known to them. In fact, the relevant files had been destroyed at Wormwood Scrubs by a German air raid. In February 1942 Klugmann was posted to the Yugoslav Section of SOE as an intelligence and coordination officer, based in Cairo. Klugmann became critical of the Serb Royalist leader General Draza Mihailovic, who was at the time the chief beneficiary of British aid and support in the resistance movement in Yugoslavia. Klugmann's reports influenced thinking at the Political Warfare Executive, Secret Intelligence Service (M16), the Foreign Office, and BBC. He suggested that the Communist leader Tito and his partisans were killing more Germans than Mihailovic's Chetniks, despite smaller numbers. Churchill switched his support to Tito (see Yugoslavia and the Allies). Some eight understrength Wehrmacht divisions and Bulgarian and Croatian Ustase units were employed in Yugoslavia during 1943 and 1944 fighting the partisans. Yugoslavia was the only country during World War II that liberated itself with little military assistance from the Allies. Although this move was one favoured by Stalin, Tito and Stalin later fell out and became bitter critics. Klugmann rose to the rank of major, an unlikely outcome given his general disposition. He was under constant surveillance, suspected of being an NKVD agent along with Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt, all of whom he knew at Cambridge, and one of whom, Maclean, had been a friend at Gresham's. Proof of this was found in the KGBs archives and it is confirmed that John \\"James\\" Klugmann was a KGB talent-spotter and agent who was instrumental in recruiting the Cambridge Five.The Mitrokhin Archive Vol.I pg.82-85 During his time in SOE and later whilst a civilian in UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) in Yugoslavia he supported Soviet aims. Post-war career Klugmann remained a devout Communist all his life and went on to play a significant role in the CPGB becoming responsible for the Education branch. After his wartime service, he became a member of the executive committee of the British Communist Party and editor of Marxism Today. Michael Straight (later owner and editor of The New Republic and chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts), an American who had studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and who had become friends there with Blunt, Kim Philby, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess described Klugmann as \\"a warm-hearted and compassionate intellectual whose commitment to Communism left him no time for such minor preoccupations as taking a bath or cleaning his fingernails.\\" One of the most active and overt British communists of his generation, Klugmann became an influential left-wing journalist after the war and wrote the first two volumes of the official History of the Communist Party of Great Britain, which was continued by Noreen Branson. He also wrote the controversial From Trotsky to Tito justifying, to a British communist audience, policy towards Tito's Yugoslavia.

Biography Early life Hans Jorgen Fjellestad was born on May 2, 1968. He studied music composition and improvisation at University of California, San Diego in San Diego, California. Career A classically trained pianist, he has composed for film, video, theater, dance and has toured with his music and film work throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Mexico, and Brazil. In 2002, he directed his first documentary film, Frontier Life. It explores Tijuana, Mexico, with a focus on the local underground electronic music scene. Two years later, in 2004, he directed Moog, the feature-length documentary about music synthesizer pioneer Robert Moog, which premiered at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. In 2009, he was the writer and producer for the 2009 music documentary The Heart Is A Drum Machine with Juliette Lewis, Elijah Wood, John Frusciante, and Jason Schwartzman. In 2010, he released a film about Depression-era life and art, When The World Breaks, which premiered at the 2010 Doc Edge Festival in New Zealand. In 2012, he directed the documentary Sunset Strip, which premiered at SXSW 2012 and was broadcast on Showtime. The Hollywood Reporter describes it as \\"entertaining almost to a fault, this color-packed doc boasts a lifetime's worth of glamour and sleaze\\" featuring Mickey Rourke, Johnny Depp, Ozzy Osbourne, Keanu Reeves, Sofia Coppola, Hugh Hefner, Sharon Stone, Courtney Love, among others. He co- founded the Trummerflora Collective, and has worked as a curator/producer for the international art initiative, inSite 05. He was artist-in-residence at the Steve Allen Theater in Hollywood 2008-2011, curating and hosting the monthly live music series ResBox. He is directing a new documentary about the offshore radio outfit Radio Caroline, currently shooting in London and planned for 2014 release. =Music career= He has an extensive discography both as a solo artist and in collaboration with many musicians in the international experimental music scene including Muhal Richard Abrams, George Lewis, Peter Kowald, L√© Quan Ninh, Lisle Ellis, Haco, Miya Masaoka, Money Mark, Yoshimi P-We, Thomas Dimuzio, G.E.

His music is available on Hollywood Records, Accretions Records, Circumvention Music, Brain Escape Sandwich, Barely Auditable Records, Pan Handler and Vinyl Communications. He usually records and performs under his own name, but has sporadically employed his alter-ego 33, as with performances at The Roxy in Prague and Bimbo's 365 Club in San Francisco. His track \\"Abominatron\\" on the Moog original film soundtrack (Hollywood Records) is credited as 33. Strangely, 33 is also the title of Fjellestad's 2003 solo cd (Accretions Records), making the artist's intentions behind the moniker somewhat unclear. Kobe Live House (Accretions Records) was released in February 2006 and is a prime example of how the keyboardist approaches his unconventional mix of acoustic and electronic sounds. Recorded live on October 17, 2003, at Big Apple (a jazz club in Ch≈´≈ç-ku, Kobe, Japan) the concert was part of the club's 14th Anniversary Special Concert Series.

It was released only in select theatres by City Lights Pictures, a Manhattan- based production company. Plot Tamara Riley is a shy and unattractive but intelligent teenage girl who likes witchcraft and has a crush on Bill Natolly, her handsome English teacher. When a critical article she writes about the school's athletes is published, two of the star athletes, Shawn and Patrick, want revenge. Tamara attempts to perform a magical ritual to bind her fate to that of her teacher, but when she must spill her own blood, she ceases the ritual. That night, a prank is orchestrated by Shawn and Patrick, along with Shawn's girlfriend Kisha. Shawn calls Tamara, impersonating Mr. Natolly, and invites her to a motel room. A video camera is placed there and catches Tamara undressing. Shawn, Patrick, and Kisha watch this, along with three others who did not know about the prank (Chloe, Jesse and Roger). Shawn comes in and taunts Tamara, and Tamara is accidentally killed in a struggle. Despite Chloe's demands that they inform the police, she is blackmailed into helping bury Tamara. However, they are shocked when Tamara walks into class, looking more attractive than ever before. They convince themselves that she was only unconscious and dug her way out of the ground. While Roger is watching a film in the school audiovisual room, the image on the screen suddenly changes to the video of Tamara's murder. Roger removes the tape and is confronted by Tamara. She torments him with hallucinations of what it is like to be buried alive and with his history of cutting himself. Then he sends a televised message to the entire school in which he proclaims that one should \\"hear no evil, speak no evil, and see no evil\\". He then cuts off his ear and tongue with a razor blade, then fatally stabs himself in the eye. Tamara then visits the home of Mr. Natolly, intending to seduce him. However, when he resists her, she says that \\"it is only a matter of time\\". The next day, she visits the school guidance counselor, Allison Natolly, the wife of Mr. Natolly. Tamara confronts Allison, mentioning Allison and Bill's infertility problems. Realizing that her father fantasizes about having sex with her and that his alcoholism drove her mother away, Tamara makes him \\"finish the bottle\\", requiring him to eat a beer bottle. At a party, Tamara puts a spell on Patrick and Shawn, and forces them to have sex with each other. Kisha attempts to stop Tamara, but is incapacitated when Tamara begins to talk about Kisha's eating disorder. Tamara tells Kisha that she is \\"skin and bone, and really should eat more\\". Kisha begins to eat herself into a stupor, but is taken away by Jesse and Chloe. When Chloe and Jesse call Mr. Natolly and tell him about what happened, Kisha (still under the spell) calls Tamara and tells her that Mr. Natolly knows. Kisha is knocked out by Chloe. Chloe, Jesse and Mr. Natolly go to Tamara's house, where they find the corpse of Tamara's father and a spellbook describing the ritual Tamara tried to perform. They realize that when they killed Tamara that night, her blood was spilled; it was because of Tamara's blood being spilled that the ritual was completed and allowed her to rise from the grave as what she is and control others through touch. Meanwhile, Tamara, learning of what the others know, sends Shawn and Patrick to the Natolly residence to kill Allison. They try, but Allison kills them both in self-defense by stabbing Patrick in the neck with a utility knife and impaling Shawn with a broken shovel. Kisha and Allison are both taken to the hospital and treated, but Kisha wakes up and chases down Jesse and Chloe. Kisha stabs Jesse to death with a carving knife. In the film's climax on the hospital roof, Mr. Natolly, Allison, Chloe and Tamara finally confront each other. Tamara attempts to control Chloe, but sees through her memories that Chloe actually cared about her and realizes that she has become a monster. She breaks down and slowly changes back into a corpse. Before fading away, Tamara asserts her will to be with Mr. Natolly and he appears to surrender to the inevitable. Mr. Natolly holds Tamara close and kisses her, then throws himself off the roof with Tamara. In the end, Chloe and Allison are fine. The camera pans back to the spellbook in the jeep, open at Part 6, \\"Resurrection and Immortality\\". The film ends implying Tamara is possessing Kisha, and steals the book.

It was in US cinemas for 13 weeks, and finished with a gross of $206,871https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3178595841/weekend/ Reception Tamara has received a mostly-negative response from critics. Aggregated across 28 reviewers, the film holds a 32% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a consensus stating, \\"Resolutely misguided without ever really crossing into 'so bad it's good' territory, Tamara lacks even the cheap thrills promised by its premise\\". This reception is mirrored on Metacritic, where a similar result of 34/100, amortized over 10 critics, materialized, indicating \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". Nathan Lee of The New York Times noted its low budget and its \\"even lower ambitions\\", but acknowledged that it had \\"one genuine, if unintentional, surprise\\". Awarding it only ‚ú¶‚úß‚úß‚úß (1 star), Slant grappled with the film's \\"insufficient imaginativeness\\" and forced \\"theme of duality\\". Maitland McDonagh, a critic specialist in horror films, wrote that Tamara \\"panders to horror buffs\\" and \\"squanders the efforts of a competent cast\\", calling it a \\"rehash of Carrie\\", and awarding it ‚ú¶‚ú¶‚úß‚úß‚úß (2 stars). Jessica Reeves of the Chicago Tribune was even more critical, panning the film with a harsh grocery list of descriptions: \\"dismal, depressing, embarrassing and utterly lacking in any artistic or social worth\\". Some reviewers were slightly more magnanimous. For instance, Kyle Smith of The New York Post enjoyed the second act, praising how screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick \\"develops [the film] suspensefully\\". He noted some of the \\"creative murders\\", which were \\"grotesque\\" enough to \\"make even horror buffs flinch\\"; however, he decried the clich√©d final act, complaining that Tamara is off-screen too much, and asserting that \\"villainy shouldn't be outsourced\\", \\"killings [shouldn't] become routine\\". Likewise, Frank Scheck, writing for Hollywood Reporter, provided a mixed review and confessed that \\"the film has its dubious pleasures\\".

The station operated until the closure of the line between Cranbourne Station and Leongatha Station in July 1993. The station remains partly intact with the platform and goods shed (now privately owned) intact, however the track one kilometre on each side of the station platform has been dismantled, and replaced by a concrete pathway for bicycles and recreational use. Koo Wee Rup was also the junction of the branch line to Strzelecki line. The establishment of the pathway has effectively removed any likelihood that the railway will be rehabilitated. It can also be seen as being the start of a rail trail on the railway reserve, stretching back to Cranbourne, which will block future rail transport options for people in Cranbourne East, Clyde, and surrounding areas. Current Status Between 1999 and 2008 there was constant speculation that the railway line from Cranbourne to Leongatha would re-open, as promised by the then Victorian State Government, under a project named 'Bringing Trains Back to Victorians'. Electrification of the railway beyond Cranbourne to Cranbourne East, Clyde and even as far as Koo Wee Rup had been advocated to serve the rapidly growing suburban fringe of south-east Melbourne. However, in May 2008, a scoping study carried out on behalf of the government found the costs of returning services high, at $72 million. Therefore, plans to reopen the line were halted, and the government pledged to spend $14.2 million on improved V/Line coach services in the South Gippsland region instead. As well, it was later announced that the railway reservation would be used for a rail trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora. Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha continues to be a prominent issue for the region. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/forums-hears-calls-for-improved- regional-public-transport/6614812 South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 stated that the return of rail was a major community priority, with funding and support being sought from all levels of government. http://www.southgippsland.vic.gov.au/Files/PRIORITY_PROJECTS_2013.pdf In early 2014, a report into possible extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee- Rup, along the disused Leongatha line, as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, established in April 2011, has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal, in close association with the South Gippsland Shire Council and other local governments. One notable achievement of the group in the past was running the successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on 9 December 1984.http://www.ptua.org.au/files/newsletters/1980s/PTUA-news-198501.pdf After the abandonment in 2008 by then premier John Brumby of the promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services made by the government of his predecessor Steve Bracks, a community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group continues to lobby key stakeholders and governments to reinstate rail services, to improve transport accessibility in the region. Rail trail Starting in early March 2012, the railway track has been gradually removed from the Koo Wee Rup area as a first step toward the creation of a rail trail on the railway alignment. The first section has been constructed - formed as a concrete pathway running one kilometre each side of the former Koo Wee Rup railway station platform.

It is the largest organization of its kind and the only entity operating globally to document written musical sources. RISM is one of the four bibliographic projects sponsored by the International Musicological Society and the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres, the others being R√©pertoire International de Litt√©rature Musicale (RILM, founded in 1966), R√©pertoire international d'iconographie musicale (RIdIM, founded in 1971), and R√©pertoire international de la presse musicale (RIPM, founded in 1980). Shortly after its founding, A.H. King called RISM, \\"one of the boldest pieces of long-term planning ever undertaken for the source material of any subject in the humanistic field.\\"Alec Hyatt King, \\"The Music Librarian, his tasks, national and international,\\" Fontes Artis Musicae 6 (1959): 54; quoted in Benton, 195. The musical sources recorded are manuscripts or printed music, writings about music and libretti. They are stored in libraries, archives, churches, schools, and private collections. RISM establishes what exists and where it is kept. RISM is recognized among experts as the key place for documenting music sources all over the world. The work of RISM in compiling a comprehensive index fulfills a twofold purpose: for one, music documents are protected from loss, and for another, they are made available to scholars and performing musicians.  Organization  Example of an autograph music manuscript: Johann Sebastian Bach, Sonata for Violin Solo, BWV 1001, preserved at the Berlin State Library (RISM ID no. 467096700 ) One or several RISM working groups in more than 35 countries take part in the project. Around 100 individuals from those working groups catalog the musical sources preserved in their countries. They use a central database that is maintained by the RISM Zentralredaktion (Central Editorial Office) in Frankfurt am Main.International Association of Music Libraries (IAML): Joint projects and assisted publications Musical sources in RISM publications and contributors in active RISM working groups include the following countries: * Afghanistan * Andorra * Argentina * Australia * Austria * Azerbaijan * Belarus * Belgium * Brazil * Bulgaria * Canada * China * Colombia * Croatia * Czech Republic * Denmark * Egypt * Estonia * Finland * France * Germany * Georgia * Greece * Guatemala * Hong Kong * Hungary * Iceland * India * Indonesia * Iran * Ireland * Israel * Italy * Japan * Latvia * Lebanon * Lithuania * Luxembourg * Mexico * Netherlands * New Zealand * Norway * Pakistan * Poland * Portugal * Romania * Russia * Saudi Arabia * Slovakia * Slovenia * South Africa * South Korea * Spain * Sweden * Switzerland * Taiwan * Tajikistan * Turkey * Ukraine * United Kingdom * United States * Uruguay * Uzbekistan * Vatican City * Venezuela The RISM Zentralredaktion and the working groups in Germany are projects funded by the Academy of Sciences and Literature in Mainz.Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz (in German) The other working groups receive independent funding in their own countries.  Publications  RISM's main publication is the RISM Catalog, a freely accessible online database containing descriptions of musical sources from around the world. In addition, RISM series, most of which were published as books, divide sources into distinct groups.For a detailed list of publications, see the RISM List of Publications  Online Catalog  The RISM Catalog has been available free of charge online since June 2010. The catalog is made possible through cooperation between RISM, the Bavarian State Library (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek), and the Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin). Most of the musical sources described in the catalog are music manuscripts (1,034,020 as of July 2020), while there is also a substantial number of printed editions (201,400), and smaller quantities of libretti (760) and treatises (130). The focus of music manuscripts is on material dating from between 1600 and 1850, though the catalog contains manuscripts that are both newer and older than this. For printed music, the focus is on music printed before 1900. The music of more than 37,000 composers preserved in over 900 libraries can be found in the catalog. Francesca Caccini, \\"Primo Libro delle Musiche\\" (Florence, 1618). RISM ID no.: 990007800 The catalog entries describe each piece in detail according to a uniform scheme containing more than 100 fields. Included are, among other things, information about: * Name of composer (including dates of birth and death) * Title * An opus or catalog number if there is one * Performing forces * Format ‚Äì e.g. score, parts or piano reduction * Additional names such as librettists, previous owners, and dedicatees * References to musicological literature * List of libraries or institutions where the item is preserved The manuscripts are described in detail with respect to copyist and place and time of origin. Printed music includes publication information such as place, year, and publisher. In addition, many works include a music incipit, that is, the opening notes or measures from important movements or sections of a piece. A variety of search boxes enables browsing and discovery through any of these fields. Specific questions can be answered by combining specific indexes. For example, it is possible to immediately access all the information stored by RISM about autograph manuscripts by Clara Schumann or the dissemination of manuscripts with music by Fran√ßois Couperin. A search by means of a music incipit is a valuable research tool when trying to identify an anonymous piece or a fragment of a piece. To make use of this tool, the researcher keys in the first few notes of the work. Apart from the stated intention of opening the way to the primary source for researchers and performers, this sort of catalog provides attractive possibilities for other areas of interest and inquiry as well. For example, one can gain insight into many different topics while researching the reception of a piece. One way could be to find out how the music of a composer was regarded after his or her death; to find this out, it would be important to know how many and which works were reissued. The database provides information not only about the dissemination of works by composers who are still well known today, but also a wealth of knowledge about those many creative musicians who were highly regarded in their day, but are currently either little known, or even forgotten. This makes the database invaluable for music historians, and also makes it possible for performing musicians to ‚Äúexcavate‚Äù and rediscover many things. The data in the online catalog is available under a Creative Commons license as linked data and linked open data for use in other library catalogs, projects in the digital humanities, or research projects.  RISM Series  During the initial years of the RISM project, a series of publications was conceived to organize the work of RISM and focus on specific repertories, most of which was published in book form. In the intervening years, much of the information, but not all, from the RISM series has been incorporated into the online catalog. The RISM series are: * Series A: manuscripts and printed music by composer * Series B: inventories of sources by topic * Series C: directory of music libraries In addition to these, working groups conduct projects to document libretti surviving in their respective countries. RISM Series A/I ‚Äì Printed Music RISM Series A/I Individual Prints before 1800 documents printed music editions containing works by a single composer published between 1500 and 1800. Collected prints (anthologies of works by various composers) are published in RISM series B. Over 78,000 printed editions by 7,616 composers (arranged alphabetically) from 2,178 libraries were documented in the nine volumes of the series (published 1971‚Äì1981). Four supplementary volumes appeared between 1986 and 1999, and in 2003, an index volume followed listing publishers, printers, engravers and places of publication. All volumes of RISM series A/I were published by B√§renreiter in Kassel. The CD-ROM was published by B√§renreiter-Verlag at the end of 2012, and the CD-ROM data were incorporated into the online catalog in 2015.\\"Printed Music (A/I and B/I) now in RISM's Online Catalog,\\" http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/browse/3/article/64/printed-music-ai- and-bi-now-in-risms-online-catalog.html RISM Series A/II ‚Äì Music Manuscripts RISM series A/II Music Manuscripts after 1600 lists only handwritten music. The project was conceived as an electronic publication from the beginning and was published as microfiche and CD-ROM. The CD-ROM version of the accumulated database produced and published by K. G. Saur in Munich was discontinued in 2008. The subscription database hosted by EBSCO (formerly by NISC) is still available. The entirety of Series A/II is in the online catalog.

Each institution described in Series C has a library siglum, which is an abbreviation to identify the institution where musical sources are located. The siglum is made up of capital letters representing the country, a hyphen, capital letters representing the city, and lowercase letters for the name of the institution. For example, \\"I-MOe\\" means \\"Italy-Modena, Biblioteca Estense Universitaria.\\" The special volume RISM-Bibliothekssigel.

He was Senior Creative Director of BioWare where he worked for 22 years prior to starting the publishing company Arcanum Worlds in 2018. In 2019, Ohlen became the lead of a new internal development studio Archetype Entertainment under Wizards of the Coast to develop new intellectual property and video games for the company. Career In his early career, Ohlen ran a comic store as well as two Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. The campaigns were so popular that each had a waiting list. BioWare founders Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk recruited Ohlen to work at the company based on his D&D; skills. At BioWare, part of his early work included testing on Shattered Steel, then becoming the lead designer for Baldur's Gate which was credited with making BioWare a successful company. As a result of the success of Baldur's Gate, Ohlen was made the company's Director of Design. He continued to work as the lead designer on BioWare's Dungeons and Dragons titles including Baldur's Gate 2 and Neverwinter Nights. He later led up the design on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Dragon Age: Origins.(November 4, 2008). \\"New 'Star Wars' online game is 4-millennium rewind\\", Chicago Tribune, p. 32. In 2006 James Ohlen moved to Austin, Texas to set up a new studio for BioWare alongside Gordon Walton and Rich Vogel. That studio was responsible for the production of the MMORPG game Star Wars: The Old Republic. In 2018 Ohlen retired from BioWare after 22 years to start up his own publishing company ‚Äì Arcanum Worlds. The first book to be produced by Arcanum Worlds is Odyssey of the Dragonlords. Wizards of the Coast announced it was establishing a new Austin-based studio in April 2019 to develop new intellectual properties (IP), and had tapped Ohlen to lead it. Ohlen said that the offer was too good to pass up, and that \\"This is just an opportunity to work on projects as personal to me as the good ol' days of the '90s and early '00s.\\" By January 2020, Wizards of the Coast revealed the studio as Archetype Entertainment, and that another former BioWare member, Chad Robertson, was named as vice-president and general manager. A month later, Drew Karpyshyn, yet another former BioWare member, came on board Archetype as lead writer. Ohlen was able to continue Arcanum Worlds under the deal, though the studio would not use any of the IP developed through Arcanum.

The station operated until the closure of the line between Cranbourne Station and Leongatha Station in 1993. This station remains partially intact with its platform and signals still in reasonable condition, the track along this section is still in reasonable condition. Current Status Between 1999 and 2008 there was constant speculation that the railway line beyond Cranbourne to Leongatha could re-open, as promised by the Victorian State Government, under a project named 'Bringing Trains Back to Victorians'. However, in May 2008, a scoping study carried out on behalf of the State Government found the costs of returning services high, at $72 million. Therefore, plans to reopen the line were stopped, and the Government has pledged to spend $14.2 million on improved V/Line coach services in the South Gippsland region instead. Further, there are plans in motion to turn the railway reservation into a Rail Trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora.e: Communication from Minister Lynne Kosky, 3 June 2008, and the Victorian Department of Infrastructure Additionally, various proposals have included extending the South Gippsland Tourist Railway service to Lang Lang, in which would increase the length of the privately operated railway to 50 kilometres. Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha is continuing to feature as a prominent issue for the region.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/forums-hears-calls-for-improved- regional-public-transport/6614812 A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 acknowledged that the return of rail as a major community priority where funding and support are sought from all forms of level government.http://www.southgippsland.vic.gov.au/Files/PRIORITY_PROJECTS_2013.pdf In early 2014, a report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee- Rup along the disused Leongatha line as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transportation and rail lobby group established in April 2011 that is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and local forms of government has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. Previously, the group was classified as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993 and the line to Barry Beach and Yarram was formally closed in June 1992 and dismantled by December 1994. One notable milestone that this group achieved in the past was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on 9 December 1984.http://www.ptua.org.au/files/newsletters/1980s/PTUA-news-198501.pdf Despite the political promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Steve Bracks led Victorian state Labor government in 1999 being abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby, a public community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group is continuing to lobby and work collaboratively with key stakeholders and governments to reinstate rail services that focuses on improving transport accessibility in the region.

He is mostly associated with Kent but also made appearances for All- England and Surrey. First recorded in the 1769 season, Miller made 65 known appearances (including single wicket) from then to 1783. He was unquestionably an outstanding batsman and perhaps second only to John Small in the 18th century. Cricket career Miller may have played before 1772, but more is known about his career from 1772 when scorecards began to be kept on a habitual basis. The first definite mention of him is in a \\"fives\\" single wicket match between Kent and Hampshire at the Artillery Ground in June 1772. He took part in all three important matches recorded in the 1772 season. In the second, playing for All-England against Hampshire at Guildford Bason, he was top scorer for his team in both innings with 30 out of 126 and then 26 out of only 86.Ashley-Cooper, p. 178. In 1773, he scored a total of 316 runs in his seven known important match appearances with a best score of 73 (out of 177) for All-England against Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine.Haygarth, p. 8. When Kent played Surrey at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1773, Miller scored 42 out of 141 in the first innings and then an unbeaten 32 out of 100/4 in the second innings.Haygarth, p. 14. In September 1773, Miller played as a \\"given man\\" for Surrey v Hampshire at Laleham Burway.Haygarth, p. 15 Miller's best known performance was for Kent v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1774 when he made 95 out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs.Haygarth, p. 19. A week later, in the return match at Broadhalfpenny Down, Miller scored 40 and 45 out of 168 and 136/6 as Kent won by 4 wickets.Haygarth, p. 20. Miller's innings of 95 was briefly the highest individual score recorded in first-class cricket, beating the 88 scored by William Yalden in 1773. Miller‚Äôs \\"world record\\" lasted only a year until John Small beat it with the earliest known first-class century.Haygarth, p. 25. Miller was less successful in 1775 and experienced a number of low scores but he did play two notable innings of 71 for Kent v Hampshire and then 42 for Surrey against Hampshire.Haygarth, pp. 23‚Äì24. He had an indifferent season in 1776 but then recovered his form in 1777 when he made a total of 311 runs in six known appearances including scores of 65, 64 and 51 in three separate matches for All-England against Hampshire.Haygarth, pp. 32‚Äì35. He made a few useful scores in 1778 when his best was 59 for Surrey against Hampshire. Miller made only one more half- century which was a score of exactly 50 for All-England against Hampshire at Itchin Stoke Down in September 1780.Haygarth, p. 46. His date of birth is unknown but, as he had been playing since the 1760s, he must have reached the veteran stage by the 1780s and his scores were less notable than they had been a decade earlier. Apart from a few useful contributions, Miller was by 1782 playing a minor role. He made three known appearances in 1783, his final season, and his last known match was Kent v Hampshire at Bourne Paddock in August. Hampshire won by 85 runs and, if the batting order in the scorecard is correct, Miller batted last and scored just 2 and 9. Style and personality Arthur Haygarth's biography of Miller quotes John Nyren's comment that Miller had a beautiful style and was as \\"firm and steady as the Pyramids\\". He was a man \\"to be depended on and very active\\" as well as being \\"a kind-hearted and amiable man\\".Haygarth, p. 58. Nyren also says that Miller and John Minshull were \\"the only two batsmen (i.e., in the 1770s) that the Hambledon men were afraid of\\". He comments on Miller's ability to \\"cut a ball at the point of the bat\\" and adds, slightly contradicting Haygarth's version, that \\"although (Miller was) fully as stout a man as Minshull, he was considerably more active\\". Little is known about Miller personally except that he seems to have been a gamekeeper employed by the Duke of Dorset at Knole House near Sevenoaks. Latterly, he took up residence with Sir Horatio Mann at Bourne, probably in the same employment. His burial took place at Bridge, Kent on 31 October 1784, only a year after his last recorded match. Alternative first name Miller's first name may be subject to question for, although he is generally known as Joseph, he has also been referred to as Richard,Major, p. 70. though that would seem to be due to confusion with the Richard Miller who played alongside him in one match for Surrey in the 1774 season.Haygarth, p. 18. In his Cricket Scores, H. T. Waghorn records that \\"Richard Miller\\" played for Kent against Surrey at Laleham Burway in June 1773Waghorn, Cricket Scores, pp. 92‚Äì93. but in Haygarth's version of this scorecard, he has listed the player as \\"J. Miller\\".Haygarth, p. 6. The majority of sources call him J. or Joseph although Nyren, a great admirer of Miller, uses his surname only.Haygarth, pp. 3‚Äì58.Nyren, p. 74.Ashley-Cooper, pp. 177‚Äì179.McCann, p. 87.Underdown, p. 144.Mote, p. 153. Haygarth, who studied all of the old scorecards and biographical material available, acknowledges that \\"there seems to have been two (Millers) but it is almost certain that J was the \\"crack\\" and played in the great contests of the day\\". G. B. Buckley does not attempt to correct Haygarth re Miller in his appendix of additions and amendments to Scores and Biographies and thereby accepts that J. Miller is the correct version.Buckley, pp. 207‚Äì236.

Budgewoi is located 112 km by road north of the Sydney central business district.Dist√¢ncia entre Budgewoi e Sydney Much of the town is surrounded by water; Lake Munmorah, Budgewoi Lake and the Pacific Ocean. An Ideal spot for water enthusiasts. Long an area of retirees and holiday homes, rising housing prices in the Sydney metropolitan area during the 1990s saw it become a sleeper town, with increased numbers of people commuting to the Sydney metropolitan area. The last decade has seen an important change in Budgewoi with the influx of people bringing greater infrastructure and development to the suburb. Coles opened its doors in 2005 expanding the central business area and drawing businesses and consumers to the area. It is still a relatively quiet, coastal town. Name Some sources give the original name as Pudgeway (Aboriginal term for young grass) but this is open to conjecture with local historian (Bruce Russell, \\"From Pudgeway to Budgewoi\\", 1984) stating the aboriginal name for the area as Budjeri, which meant \\"good conditions\\" and described the abundance of wallabies, birds, fish, prawns, trees, shrubs and plants they could use to sustain a healthy tribe. The early colonists named the area Pudgewoy but over the years it has been known by many other names: Budgeway, Possum's Fence, Sinking, Sandy Point, Halekulani and the present name of Budgewoi which was made official in July 1978. Another source says Budgewoi is an Aboriginal term for \\"Where the Waters Meet\\" and this describes the landscape. A news article from The Sun on 14 September 1923 describes \\"Budgewoi\\" as aboriginal for \\"Good Fishing\\" History In 1827, John Slade offered grant of but appears not to have taken up the offer. On 11 August 1843, Robert Henderson was granted in what is now known as Budgewoi, where he had a dairy. In 1856 Henderson Holdings was purchased by John Hargraves who built \\"Noraville\\". Wollombi Aboriginal Tribe members are known to have worked on the property. Some sources state that Hargraves \\"befriended\\" tribe members. Cattle were grazed as far as Buff Point and Elizabeth Bay. Norah Head lighthouse built and opened in 1903 after vessel wreckages. Originally used for grazing cattle and agriculture, by the early 1930s Budgewoi was becoming known as a holiday destination and families would come from Sydney to camp over weekends and during holidays. However, getting to the area was not easy so it did not become as popular as other places on the Central Coast. Surrounding areas Chinese fishermen worked the Tuggerah Lakes area in the late 1850s, in particular, what is now known as Canton Beach at Toukley. While not confirmed, it is believed this is where the name is derived from. It was a base for catching and curing fish that were then shipped to Queensland, the goldfields and back to China. 1889 saw the opening of the railway from Sydney to Newcastle and Wyong turning into a proper township with the opening of the Royal Hotel and the first post office established. The railway was the making of the timber industry. In its hey day, around the turn of the century, Wyong exported thousands of railway sleepers. In 1904 the Lighthouse at Norah Head was built and the first few houses began to appear at The Entrance. Already early tourists were making the trip to Tuggerah Lakes - by boat, horse-drawn vehicle and train. They went mainly for the fishing and the long bracing walks along the beaches. Slowly, but surely, the population of the Shire grew. Roads, bridges and boarding houses were built. After the war, the Central Coast came of age. The event was marked by the creation of a New Shire, Wyong, out of the old Erina Shire in 1947. Schools The Budgewoi Public School was built in 1961, the first headmaster being Mr R. Passlow. He had a staff of five and about 150 pupils in the original block on the corner of Woolana and Lukela avenues. The official record of the school states that a teacher was appointed in January 1960 and the first class started in February 1960. It is possible that these pupils were taught at the Budgewoi Hall, the only one available at the time. The alternative would have been a home or a marquee.excerpt from \\"From Pudgeway to Budgewoi\\" originally compiled by Bruce Russell in 1983 and since updated With no high school located in the town, it has always been necessary for students to be bused to schools in the surrounding area; this was Wyong High School until the opening of Gorokan High School in 1976 and to Northlakes High School since its opening in 1981. Churches St John's Budgewoi had Church of England services held fortnightly in the community hall during the 1950s and 1960s. The Budgewoi Ladies Guild was formed to buy a block of land, which was purchased for $423. In December 1971 St John the Evangelist Budgewoi was dedicated and 20 people attended and worshipped. In 2006 church buildings were in need of refurbishment and upgrading to meet the requirements of Wyong Shire Council and due to the short notice given by Council and the significant funds needed the Parish Council reluctantly agreed that it had no option but to close the church for public worship. The final service was held in St John's Church Budgewoi on 10 September 2006 and it was formally closed by the Assistant Bishop of Newcastle, Graeme Rutherford, on that day.

The island is a part of the Italian comune of Lampedusa e Linosa, part of the province of Agrigento in Sicily, Italy. It has a population of 430. Name The island is cited first as Greek Aethusa (Œë·º∞Œ∏Œø·ø¶œÉœÉŒ±) by ancient geographer Strabo, and as Algusa (·ºàŒªŒ≥Œø·ø¶œÉœÉŒ±) by Roman essayist Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia. The name \\"Lenusa\\" appeared first during the 16th century in the writing of Tommaso Fazello, while the modern one dates back to 1845. Geography The island has an area of and is of volcanic origin. It is formed by a series of craters of which Monte Vulcano, high, is the most important. The closest land to Linosa is the island of Lampedusa, which lies to the south. Linosa is situated west of Gozo, Malta, southeast of Pantelleria, south of Sicily and east of Cape Mahida in Tunisia. History View of the village of Linosa During the Punic Wars it was used by the Romans as a base; the 150 water cisterns remaining are from this period. Roman domination was followed by Saracen, Norman, Angevin and Aragonese control. During the Napoleonic Wars, the British considered the possibility of taking over Linosa (together with Pantelleria and Lampedusa) so as to be able to supply Malta, but a Royal Commission stated in an 1812 report that there would be considerable difficulties in this venture. The island remained deserted until 1843 when Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies ordered Knight Bernardo Maria Sanvinsente, captain of frigate, to colonize the island. The first thirty colonists (artisans from Ustica, Agrigento and Pantelleria) with the addition of a major, a priest and a doctor, landed on 25 April 1845. During World War II, a small Italian garrison surrenderedWorld War II Database: Battle of Pantelleria and Pelagie Islands to a British force from HMS Nubian on the morning of 13 June 1943. Few were interested in the island during the Kingdom of Italy and only in the 1970s did the island begin to change, with technological innovations and the development of tourism. The first telephone exchange was installed in 1963, the first power station in 1967, and a new school with a nursery in 1968. In 1983 the building of a desalinization plant provided a constant supply of potable water. Economy Linosa's population subsists on agriculture and tourism. Typical house in Linosa.

These cars were based on the Chevrolet Chevelle, but the line had its own logo and nameplate, and was neither marketed nor actively sold in the United States. Its logo consisted of an arrow, similar to that of Pontiac, but with a maple leaf to signify its dual heritage from both sides of Lake Ontario. 1962-1965: As an Acadian To promote automobile manufacturing in Canada, the Auto Pact (APTA) in the 1960s had provisions prohibiting sales of certain American-made cars. General Motors responded by offering certain makes of cars manufactured in Canada primarily for the Canadian market such as Acadian and Beaumont. Beaumont started out as a trim level of the Acadian line from 1962 to 1965. The Acadian from 1962 to 1969 was based on the contemporary Chevrolet Chevy II (Nova). Beaumonts were sold at Pontiac-Buick Dealers primarily for the Canadian market, but were also made and sold in some countries outside of North America. In 1962, the Acadian was offered in eight models with either base Invader or deluxe Beaumont series. The Beaumont provided extra quality trim, identifications, and luxury. Items such as foam- cushioned rear seats, horn ring on steering wheel, rear armrests, and automatic front door dome light switches were standard Beaumont features. In 1963, the Acadian was offered in four series: base Invader, midlevel Canso, deluxe Beaumont, or Beaumont Sport Deluxe. The Beaumont again offered similar trim, identification, and luxury as the 1962 model did. The Beaumont Sport Deluxe was equivalent to the Chevy II Nova Super Sport, added deluxe identification and a substantial number of luxury items - upgraded upholstery and trim in six possible colours, extra cushion padding in bucket seats and rear seats, deluxe door handles, glove box light, and chrome-plated heat control and instrument panel knobs. With a Powerglide automatic transmission or three speed manual, a console and floor-mounted shift lever were standard on the Beaumont Sport Deluxe with the Powerglide only. Only a 6 cylinder was available. In 1964 and 1965, GM of Canada sold an \\"Acadian Beaumont\\" based on the Chevelle A-body platform, and continued to sell the Chevy II-based Acadian. By 1966, the Acadian was clearly Chevy II-based, and the Beaumont was Chevelle-based. Many people considered the cars to be Pontiacs, but GM marketed them as a separate marque. All model years are primarily Chevrolet, with only minor trim differences and (for Chevelle-based cars) Pontiac Tempest/LeMans-based instrument panels. This is because Canada required GM to have a certain percentage of Canadian content in the vehicles sold there. The popular Beaumont became available in three series on the Acadian - Beaumont Standard, Beaumont Custom, and Beaumont Sport Deluxe. A base-trimmed Beaumont Standard convertible was also offered, a model also produced in the base Chevelle line in Canada, but not in the United States. 1966-1969: As a standalone marque From 1966, the Acadian name was only used for the Nova- based car and Beaumont became a standalone marque, still sold by Pontiac-Buick dealers. The interiors used the dash panel from the (U.S.) Pontiac Tempest/LeMans/GTO series. Exterior sheetmetal is shared with the Chevelle (the rear taillight housings are Beaumont-exclusive - taillight lenses have wraparound corners with the exception of the 1967 model, where its trapezoidal shape is similar in appearance to the one used on the later 1969 Plymouth Belvedere/Satellite). While full wheel covers came from the Pontiac LeMans, small hubcaps and rally wheels were similarly trimmed but not the same as on the Chevelle. The cars sported an emblem based on Pontiac's arrowhead motif with two red maple leaves or fleur-de-lis added. They featured the same powerplants as the Chevrolet Chevelle, including the OHV inline six-cylinder engine, and a variety of small- and big-block V8s. The V8 engine choices included small-block 283, 307, 327, and later 350 cubic-inch versions, while the Mark IV big-block could be ordered in its 396 cubic inch displacement from 1966-69. 3- and 4-speed manual transmissions were available, as were the 2-speed Powerglide and 3-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic starting in 1967. A popular configuration for the both the Beaumont and its sister, the Chevrolet Chevelle, were the six cylinder engines or the small block 283 V8, and to a lesser extent, the 327 V8 with the Powerglide transmission, allowing for fuel economy and reasonable performance at higher RPM. Models equipped with the 2 speed Powerglide were low on performance at the line and at low RPMs, but capable of exacting more torque and performance at higher speeds and RPM, simply due to the configuration of the transmission, and the fact there were only 2 forward gears. The Sport Deluxe (SD) models were equivalent to the Chevrolet Chevelle Super Sport trim level, and featured optional bucket seats and center console, as well as SD body striping and trim. The SD396 models are the most desirable Beaumonts today. Only 451 were built in 1967, but most succumbed to the harsh Canadian winter climate, which makes them significantly more rare than equivalent Chevelles and desirable to some collectors. The SD was actually the \\"Sports Option\\" package that was available on the Beaumont Custom Sport Coupe and convertible, rather than its own series early in 1967. Starting in December the model 738 Sport Deluxe model was separate, no longer the A51 Sport Option. In addition to the SD series, the Beaumont line included base, custom and deluxe lines. A convertible was available. Other body styles were identical to those offered on the Chevelle for the given year, including a very rare four-door hardtop offered from 1966 to 1969. Starting in 1970, GM Canada discontinued the Beaumont in favor of both Chevrolet Chevelle and Pontiac LeMans midsized cars, which were identical to U.S. models. Production and sales out of Canada Beaumonts were also made in a GM Overseas Operation factory in Arica, Chile, for the local market (the TECNA assembly plant assembled Beaumonts from CKD kits until 1971 using the 1968 bodystyle introduced during 1969), and the Canadian-made cars were sold in Puerto Rico for a time. Beaumonts were also locally assembled in South Africa at the GM Port Elizabeth assembly plant using CKD kits with a mirror-flipped 1968 Chevelle instrument cluster and dash (South African market cars are right-hand drive). Both Chile and South Africa commenced local assembly with CKD kits and local content components to avoid import tariffs.

It has command and control of military and armed police forces in the three northeast provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning, which also form Military Districts. This region is now superseded by the Northern Theater Command. The Shenyang Military Region was left with unchanged boundaries since the late 1960s. It is bordered internally by the Beijing Military Region to the west. Externally, it is bordered by North Korea to the south east and the Russian Far East to the north. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, military region commanders tended to remain in post for long periods. As the PLA took a stronger role in politics, this began to be seen as something of a threat to party (or, at least, civilian) control of the military. Two commanders served for long periods in the Shenyang MR, Chen Xilian, from 1959‚Äì73, and Li Desheng from 1974-85. As of 15 March 1967, the Central Intelligence Agency identified eight armies in the Shenyang MR.Central Intelligence Agency, National Intelligence Estimate No. 13-3-67 Communist China's Military Policy and its General Purpose and Air Defense Forces, 6 April 1967 , page 28 of 34 The CIA identified the 16th Army, 23rd Army, the 38th, 39th Army, 40th Army, 46th, 50th, and 64th Armies. However the 38th Army is now assigned to the Beijing Military Region. The Shenyang Region adjoins the Russian Far East Military District, which numbered some 76,000 personnel in 2007,IISS Military Balance 2007 and is now the Eastern Military District. However, there is a military limitation treaty and information disclosure agreement in place between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China. Analysts suggest that it's the second most important military region next to the Beijing Military Region.

Beyond its southern end, Crow Point, England is the mouth of the River Taw estuary. It is part of the Taw-Torridge estuary Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is at the centre of the UNESCO- designated North Devon's Biosphere Reserve, where Braunton Burrows lies at the heart. Saunton Sands Hotel overlooks the beach at the northern end. The beach is cordoned off a few times a year and the beach used as an airstrip for military transport planes, usually Lockheed C-130 Hercules of the Royal Air Force, to practice STOL beach landings and take offs. Flying kites is prohibited, accordingly, on part of the beach. Saunton Sands is popular with surfers because the beach is long, an unusually exposed westerly, and provides space for large groups. The beach has no life guards and is known to have dangerous riptides. Swimming here is dangerous and has resulted in many coast guard call outs. On 3 August 1990, a temperature of was recorded at Saunton Sands, which is the highest temperature recorded in the Devon and Cornwall region. In popular culture Saunton Sands was used as a location for the 1946 Powell and Pressburger film A Matter of Life and Death (sometimes called Stairway to Heaven), and can be seen where David Niven's character is washed up on the beach after he jumps from his plane without a parachute ‚Äì and survives. It was a major location for the 1978 horror film The Shout, along with the adjacent Braunton Burrows. The beach was used as a location for the Second World War Anzio landings scenes in the 1982 Pink Floyd film The Wall and as the backdrop for over 700 wrought iron hospital beds on the cover of the band's 1987 album A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Saunton Sands also doubled for the Normandy beaches in 2014's movie Edge of Tomorrow. In the late 1990s the beach was used for the video for the Robbie Williams song \\"Angels\\". In 2013 it was used again for the video for the Olly Murs song \\"Hand on Heart\\". The BBC One series A Very English Scandal filmed scenes as Saunton Sands to depict a California beach, using digitally rendered palm trees, where the character of Peter Bessell (Alex Jennings) lives.

Dragons make their home in the Desert, which is Prince Rohan's princedom. For generations, dragons have been hunted for sport and for population control, but Rohan abhorred the prestigious tradition that had won his father respect, acclaim, and eventually his death. After avenging his father, Zehava, Rohan's first decree as Prince was to outlaw dragonslaying. This act was viewed with amusement by the other Princes, whom thought the decree eccentric and Rohan a young buffoon. Rohan did not let fancy alone guide his decree; however, he felt certain that dragons were vitally important to the survival of the Continent. Rohan knew he had been right, when he and Sioned discovered the dragon gold. Terminology: *sire: male dragon *she-dragon: female dragon *clutch: a group of dragons *hatchling: baby dragon, recently hatched from an egg *grandsire: large, old, male dragons Description Dragons are large, carnivorous creatures. When dragons stand on all four legs, they can be about as tall as two grown men from head to toe. In addition to the four grasping limbs, dragons have large, taloned wings, a long, powerful neck, and a spiked tail. At the base of the spiked tail are glands that leak oils, when the sire is ready to mate; these oils have a pungent odor. Dragons' wingspan can grow to about twenty or thirty feet in length, and the wings themselves can be used to soak in the sun's heat. Their teeth can be nearly a foot long, and they have claws that can be as thick as a man's wrist, which are used to scale cliff walls, such as Rivenrock Canyon. Dragons can be found in many different colors. For example, they can be dark gold with a gold and black patterned tail, greenish bronze with black underwings, reddish black, etc.. As they primarily live in the Desert, dragons' thick hide can withstand very high temperatures. Dragon hide must also be tough in order to survive battles of dominance and mating. Hatchling dragons are about the size of a four-year-old child and look like miniature versions of their adult counterparts. Their wings are wet from being inside the egg, so hatchlings have the ability to breathe fire. This fire is used to dry and toughen the young wings, which is necessary for flight. The hatchlings only have this ability for half a year. The blood of dragons is poisonous to most other creatures, including humans. The poison consumes the victim with chills, blurs vision, makes him or her dizzy, and induces vomiting. This poison is very fast acting, but there is a cure in the form of a wafer and certain herbs, which needs to be consumed. Dragons are cunning creatures, but single-minded. While in mating season, dragons, especially the sires, are very violent. An example of a dragon's cunning is seen in the way the beast hunts: he/she waits, calculating which way a herd will turn before attacking. This way a dragon very rarely misses its prey as they dive toward their target, grasp it in their hind claws, then snap the prey's neck with front talons before landing gracefully to feast. Communication is a trait humans and dragons share. Communication with other dragons is demonstrated through shared remembrances of the Plague, challenges, and a form of laughter. Later it was discovered that humans and dragons could communicate through their colors and patterns on the light. Feylin's Discoveries Dragons are color sensitive. This was discovered by Feylin through experimentation with dyed sheep. Using an unscented dye, she colored sheep in bright blues, crimsons, purples, etc., and left a few their natural white; all the dragons converged on the white sheep, scrupulously avoiding the colored ones. Feylin then conducted another experiment with duller dyes of tans and browns. The dragons did not avoid these dyed sheep, though the natural white ones still seemed preferred. In 719 Feylin had the opportunity to dissect a dragonsire. Sioned and Maarken aided her study using their Sunrunner memory and Maarken also drew careful renderings of bone, organs, and muscles. The dissection revealed that a dragon's brain is about double the size of a human one, but without as many wrinkles. The back portion of the brain is significantly larger than the front portion and the whole thing is a grayish color. Eyes, tongue, teeth, nasal cavity, stomach, lungs, heart, chest cavity, wings, and legs were also all cataloged, measured, and drawn. Society Dragons are communal animals. They live in clutches of varying sizes led by a mating sire and consisting mainly of she-dragons. Dragon hierarchy is such that the sire leads, senior she-dragons follow, then young she-dragons, and finally three- year-olds, who are not yet ready to mate. The hatchlings are raised by the entire clutch; after a she-dragon lays her eggs and seals the cave her hatchlings are treated like all hatchlings. Only when a she-dragon is carrying her eggs is she fiercely protective of her brood. When not hunting, mating, or on the move, dragons often sunbathe and even play in lakes. Dragon clutches roam the Continent, flying from the Catha Hills up to the Verseche Mountains. In late spring of every third year, called a dragon year, the dragons return to the land of their birth, the Desert, to lay their eggs. If a dragon dies, then the clutch avoids the area not wanting to reside in a place filled with painful memories. This action signifies a deep intelligence and sensitivity between dragons, especially as dragons not living at the painful times could 'see' and 'remember' those events. Such behavior was witnessed after so many dragons died of Plague near Rivenrock; the next mating season the dragons found new caves between Skybowl and Feruche. Mating Cycle Dragons mate every three years. They return to the Desert to mate and lay their eggs because the eggs need the Desert heat for the incubation period. Sires mate with a clutch of at least a dozen or so she-dragons, but they first have to win the females' attention through the sand-dance and the cliff-dance. Aside from the dances, they also battle each other, resulting in the death of the loser. To ready themselves for the vigorous matings, sires eat a plant called bittersweet. During mating season, a sire is liable to kill anything that distracts it from the mating process. The sand-dance is an exhibition of grace, prowess, and endurance. The sires perform this dance in front of the egg-laden she-dragons. The young she-dragons pay rapt attention to the mating sires, while the matured females act indifferent to their antics. To perform the dance a group of five sires land within a circle of watching females. The sires stand up on their hind legs, stretch their long necks skyward, spread their wings, and then start to sing, which to the human ear sounds like discordant wailing. One of the sires begins the dance, dropping his head, sweeping the sand into torrents with his wings, and clawing at the air. The dragon then sways from side to side and start a set pattern of leg and wing movements. After he has completed the dance and marked out his territory, he rises to his full height and begins the dance again. Each of the five sires start their dance at different times. The watching females sway in time with the male who has caught their attention. When one of the sires missteps or somehow messes up the dance, he must take to the sky and allow his place in the sand to be taken by another sire. As the dance continues the males slowly separate, leading their females away from the others. If a male tries to rush his females he could still lose them. Once the sire and his she-dragons take flight, the mates have been chosen. Mated she-dragons lay approximately twenty eggs each; out of those twenty only about five or six hatchlings typically survive the first flight. These females lay their eggs in caves, which have been hollowed by dragons as well as time, then seal off the entrance to their hatchery using the debris from the hollowed cave. During the incubation period female sentinels keep watch over the sealed caves. Late in the summer the sentries will leave, which signifies that the dragon eggs are hatching. Once the hatchling dragons break free from the eggs they try to break through the sealed cave entrance. The first to hatch usually tire by the time their brethren are emerging, making them easy prey. As hatchlings can breathe fire, their first meal is roast dragon. After the strong feast upon the weak, they must finish breaking out of the entombed cave, then fly. Unmated she-dragons die, usually because they try to fly. As unmated females do not lay their eggs, this added weight renders the females flightless in the mating caves. If she attempts to fly, she will crash; if she stays in the caves, she will likely starve. The little known or seen Opal dragons of the royal class and others of royalty do not lay eggs or bury their young they bear between 3 and 5 live nestlings this is so there are few and healthier offspring to royals. All other rituals remain the same as any other dragons. Human relations Before Prince Rohan's reign most people seemed to either be afraid of dragons or hate them because the beasts killed their herds. In both cases the general consensus was to have the monsters killed. Dragon relations did not improve when the plague arrived with the dragonflight in 701, though as the dragons themselves began to die the beasts were no longer held responsible. The superstition \\"Dragon's cry before dawn, death before dawn,\\" is an example of dragons' widespread reception. Dragon hunts Dragon hunting had been a prestigious sport and tradition before Prince Rohan outlawed it. It had been a test of manhood and of battle prowess. Zehava, Rohan's father, had held the record for the number of successful dragon hunts at nine slain - the tenth dragon fatally wounded Zehava. The dragon hunts had a more practical purpose too: population control. Every three years hundreds of hatchlings were born in the Desert. These young dragons would fly over the Continent destroying crops and killing herds. The easiest way to control the dragon population was to kill the mating sires as this also killed his unmated females and left all of their eggs unfertilized. Only the Prince got to slay the mating sires. Like most sports, dragon hunting had specific rules of conduct: * Signs - When going on a hunt, one must first find the prey. Claw and wing marks are good signs that a dragon is nearby, as are shorn bittersweet plants. * We advance? - Once signs of a dragon have been found, the dragon hunter is asked if the hunting party should advance. In order for the hunt to continue the hunter must reply, \\"We advance.\\" * Formation - When the beast is found, the party members spread out in a semicircle while the hunter rides forward, alone, to meet the dragon. The semicircle does not engage the dragon unless given the signal by the hunter's second. The second will not give the signal unless the hunter is in mortal peril. In addition to the sire hunts, there was the Hatching Hunt, an event held in the Desert during the hatching season: triennial in mid-summer. An ensemble of Lords sets out from Stronghold to slay the still young and fairly weak dragons. These hunts were necessary to keep the dragon population down, but the hunters also profited by collecting the coveted dragon hides. During the Hatching Hunt, the hunters waited outside the sealed dragon caves, then slew the hatchlings as they emerged into sunlight for the first time. Dragon gold While incubating the baby dragons breathe flame on the inner surface of their eggs, which in turn melts the shell and releases the gold. This gold is collected from caves - abandoned dragon hatcheries - in Threadsilver Canyon, which is near Skybowl. The gold is smelted into gold bars and/or coins in lower caves of the canyon. This gold is used for the benefit of the princedom and the Continent as a whole. It is kept a secret from all but a select few - namely the royal family, the Lords of Skybowl, and some of the miners - so that the other Princes don't try to invade the Desert or capture their own dragons. The dragon gold was used to buy dranath from Roelstra during the plague of 701. The gold coins were sent to Feruche, which was then held by Ianthe, Roelstra's daughter. Ianthe took her eldest son, Ruval, to see the gold and he kept a coin. Years later after he'd become a sorcerer, he was able to 'read' the coin's memory; he discovered the Desert's secret. Ruval used this knowledge, amongst other threats, to force Pol to duel him for the right of Princemarch and the future title of High Prince. To disguise the gold Rohan sent some to the crafters of Tiglath and a large quantity to a real goldmine on Kierst. The gold was hidden by Rohan's men, and then 'mined' on Kierst for Prince Volog without his knowledge of its true origin. Volog used the gold for the betterment of his princedom, which was why Rohan supplied it to his mine. One of Volog's betterments, at Rohan's subtle suggestion, was a scriptorium. Dragon census *698: 309 in flight from Desert caves, including 6 mating sires, 80 mature females, and 220 immature dragons and first-flight hatchlings; numbers taken after Hatching Hunt *701: 234 in flight over the Veresch (count made before the plague struck) *704: 37 reported, including 5 mating sires and 32 mature females *719: 160 estimated, including 13 sires and 55 mating females; 142 counted over Stronghold, including 8 brown youngsters, 5 gray females, 16 bronze and black females, 36 immature, 1 brown sire, 1 black sire, 2 gray sires, 3 gold sires, 42 red dragons, and 28 gray, greenish, and bronze immature *728: 165 counted before the hatching, including 17 sires, 85 females, 63 immature; 350 (+) estimated after the hatching, including 189 hatchlings Bonding Dragons can communicate on the light much like a Sunrunner or sorcerer. The main difference is that dragons primarily use images and feelings rather than words. Sioned was the first person to discover that humans and dragons could speak on the light. She and a female dragon named Elisel formed a deep bond, each able to feel the other's emotions and eventually to speak. Over the years many dragons and Sunrunners bonded. The bond between human and dragon are very strong, in some cases so much so that if one dies the other will feel it. =Known dragons= *Abisel: Bonded to Hollis *Azhdeen: Pol's reddish-gold dragonsire, bonded in 728 during the duel with Ruval. *Elisel: Sioned's reddish she-dragon, bonded on the way home from the Rialla of 719 near the future site of Dragon's Rest. *Lainian: Bonded to Jeni *Pavisel: Bonded to Maarken *Sadalian: Bonded to Riyan *Tirita: Bonded to Tobren *Unnamed: Bonded to Andry during the last battle against the Vellant'im. This dragon gave itself over to Andry, so he could use its strength to kill using the ros'salath. The dragons wanted revenge on the Vellant'im for killing other dragons, so many followed this dragon's lead. By bonding with Andry this dragon also took away the pain caused by iron piercing some Sunrunners.

He was one of the founders of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The elder son of Ernest, first Lord Simon and Shena, Lady Simon, he inherited the title on his father's death in 1960. Although he never renounced the title, he did not use it, either. After Gresham's School, Holt, Norfolk, where he was a contemporary of James Klugmann, Benjamin Britten and Donald Maclean, Simon read economics at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. While there he was invited to join the Political Economy Club run by John Maynard Keynes. At one of the club's meetings, Piero Sraffa, a friend of Antonio Gramsci, advised him to read Karl Marx, and Simon later joined the Communist Party, as his brother Brian Simon had done earlier. Simon was influenced in this decision by meeting Emile Burns on the boat to the Soviet Union in 1936 - a trip with his parents. In 1935, he qualified as a solicitor, and from 1942 to 1945 he served in the Royal Signals. He went for officer training at Catterick, where he met the Marxist Arnold Kettle, later a close friend. From 1945 to 1946, he taught law at Welbeck Abbey, where soldiers with three years' service could have a month's free education. At Welbeck he met Edmund Penning-Rowsell, another communist who became a lifelong friend and fellow wine enthusiast. From 1946 to 1958, he worked for Ealing Borough Council as a solicitor. He married Daphne May in 1951 and they had two children. He had a love of walking and often visited the Lake District. In 1958 he joined the Labour Research Department, becoming secretary from 1965 to 1977 but continued doing work for the organisation until just before his death. He published many pamphlets and articles on economic issues. Within the Communist Party, where he sat on the Economic Committee, he strongly supported the ‚ÄúEurocommunist‚Äù philosophy. He was also on the board of Lawrence and Wishart and encouraged the publication of ‚ÄúSelections from the Prison Notebooks of Antonio Gramsci‚Äù in 1971. His last ten years were devoted to red-green politics. He was a member of the William Morris Society. References * Pat Devine, Obituary, The Guardian, 25 October 2002.

Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha is continuing to feature as a prominent issue for the region.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/forums-hears-calls-for-improved- regional-public-transport/6614812 A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 acknowledged that the return of rail as a major community priority where funding and support are sought from all forms of level government.http://www.southgippsland.vic.gov.au/Files/PRIORITY_PROJECTS_2013.pdf In early 2014, a report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee- Rup along the disused Leongatha line as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transportation and rail lobby group established in April 2011 that is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and local forms of government has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. Previously, the group was classified as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993 and the line to Barry Beach and Yarram was formally closed in June 1992 and dismantled by December 1994. One notable milestone that this group achieved in the past was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984.http://www.ptua.org.au/files/newsletters/1980s/PTUA-news-198501.pdf Despite the political promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Steve Bracks led Victorian state Labor government in 1999 being abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby, a public community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group is continuing to lobby and work collaboratively with key stakeholders and governments to reinstate rail services that focuses on improving transport accessibility in the region. Public transport‚ÄîV/Line V/Line Coach services are provided to the township, with the bus stop opposite the now closed Hotel being the main point for passenger drop-off and pickup. The coach services originate at Leongatha and travel via the townships served by the former South Gippsland Rail Line (including Nyora), stopping at Korumburra, Loch, Nyora, Lang Lang, Koo Wee Rup, and Cranbourne. Some services terminate at Cranbourne, and others terminate at Southern Cross station in the Melbourne CBD. Television The railway station was used as a former railway station building converted into a radio station office in the ABC TV produced \\"Something In The Air\\". The town in which the station was set was \\"Emu Springs\\", and features some other Nyora landmarks, including the Nyora (Emu Springs) General Store, the local Church and the Nyora Hotel.

The territories covered an area of , with 10.4 million inhabitants. Attempts to create German-Austria under these auspices were ultimately unsuccessful, and the new state of the First Austrian Republic was created in 1919.  Creation  In Habsburg Austria-Hungary, \\"German-Austria\\" was an unofficial term for the areas of the empire inhabited by Austrian Germans. On 12 October 1918 Emperor Charles I met with the leaders of the largest German parties. German Nationalists wanted a constitutional monarchy of free nations; Christian Socialists wanted to maintain monarchy and a federation of nations; Social Democrats wanted a republic that would either be a part of a federation of nations or join Germany. On 16 October 1918 Emperor Charles I published a manifesto which offered to change Austria-Hungary into a federation of nationalities. This came too late as Czechs and Southern Slavs were well on their way to creating independent states. However, this gave an impulse to the (Austrian parliament) of German-inhabited areas to meet. With the impending collapse of the empire, the 208 ethnic German deputies, elected in 1911 to the Cisleithanian , met on 21 October 1918 and proclaimed itself to be a \\"Provisional National Assembly for German-Austria\\" representing the ethnic Germans in all Cisleithanian lands. It elected Franz Dinghofer of the German National Movement, Jodok Fink of the Christian Social Party, and Karl Seitz of the Social Democratic Workers' Party as assembly presidents. The assembly included representatives from Bohemia, Moravia, and Austrian Silesia who refused to submit to the new state of Czechoslovakia which had been declared on 28 October 1918. It also proclaimed that \\"the German people in Austria are resolved to determine their own future political organization to form an independent German-Austrian state, and to regulate their relations with other nations through free agreements with them\\". On 25 October Provisional Assembly called on all German inhabited Lands to form their own provisional assemblies. During its second meeting on 30 October the Provisional National Assembly created the basic institutions of the new state. The legislative power was assumed by the Provisional National Assembly while the executive power was entrusted to the newly created German-Austrian State Council. On 11 November 1918, Emperor Charles I in all but name abdicated, by relinquishing his right to take part in Austrian affairs of state. The next day, 12 November, the National Assembly officially declared German-Austria a republic and named Social Democrat Karl Renner as provisional chancellor. On the same day it drafted a provisional constitution that stated that \\"German- Austria is a democratic republic\\" (Article 1) and \\"German-Austria is an integral part of the German republic\\" (Article 2).http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi- content/alex?apm=0&aid;=sgb&datum;=19180000&page;=26 Gesetz √ºber die Staatsform. StGBl. Nr. 484/1919 The latter provision reflected the deputies' view that felt that Austria would lose so much territory in any peace settlement that it would no longer be economically and politically viable as a separate state, and the only course was union with Germany. This was enforced by the refusal of Hungary to sell grain and of Czechoslovakia to sell coal to Austria-Germany. As the Empire collapsed and a ceasefire was announced, the Provisional Assembly sought to forestall socialist revolution by organizing a coalition government led by the minority Social Democrats. Karl Renner became Chancellor and Victor Adler became Foreign Minister. The Social Democrats co- opted newly created soldier and worker councils and used their control over labour unions to implement social policies that blunted the socialist appeal. Constitutional Assembly Elections to the Constituent Assembly were held on 16 February 1919 and for the first time women were allowed to vote. Out of the 38 German inhabited constituencies only 25 participated and 159 deputies were elected to the 170 seats with Social Democrats as the largest party. Social Democrats won 72 seats, Christians Socials 69 and German Nationalists 26. The Constituent National Assembly first met on 4 March 1919 and on 15 March a new government was formed, once again led by Karl Renner. Austrian Social Democrats, despite being one of the leading Marxist parties with its Austromarxism current, did not attempt to seize power or to institute socialism. However, the majority of conservative, Catholic politicians still distrusted them and this led to the fatal left-right split that plagued the First Republic and led to its downfall by 1934. Social Democrat leader Otto Bauer wrote: \\"German-Austria is not an organism which has followed the laws of historical growth. It is nothing but the remnant of what remained of the old Empire after other nations had broken away from it. It remained as a loose bundle of divergent Lands.\\" Failed union with Germany On 13 November 1918, German-Austria asked Germany to start negotiations of union and on 15 November sent a telegram to President Wilson to support union of Germany and Austria. This was grounded in the view that Austria had never been a nation in the true sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for over 700 years (dating to the Holy Roman Empire), its only unifying force had been the Habsburgs. Apart from being German-inhabited, these Lands had no common \\"Austrian\\" identity. They were Habsburg-ruled lands that had not joined the Prussian-dominated German Empire after the Austrian Empire lost the Austro-Prussian War. On 12 March 1919, the Constituent Assembly re-confirmed an earlier declaration that German-Austria was a constituent part of the German republic. Pan-Germans and Social Democrats supported the union with Germany, while Christian Socialists were less supportive. During spring and summer of 1919, unity talk meetings between German and Austrian representatives continued. All this changed after 2 June 1919 when the draft peace treaty with Austria was presented, which demonstrated that the Western Allies were opposed to any union between Germany and Austria. Treaty of Saint Germain After submitting a formal note of protest to the Allies against blocking German-Austrian union, on 10 September 1919 Renner signed the Treaty of Saint Germain and it was ratified by the Constituent National Assembly on 17 October. According to its provisions, on 21 October the country changed its name from \\"German-Austria\\" to \\"Republic of Austria\\". It also lost the Sudetenland and German Bohemia to Czechoslovakia, South Tyrol and Istria (including the Adriatic port of Trieste) to the Kingdom of Italy, and Carniola, Lower Styria and Dalmatia to Yugoslavia. Article 88 of the treaty, sometimes called a \\"pre-Anschluss attempt\\", stated: This clause effectively foreclosed any attempt by Austria to unite with Germany. Likewise, the Treaty of Versailles, dictating the terms of peace for Germany, forbade any union between Austria and Germany. With these changes and the settling of Austria's frontiers, the era of the First Republic of Austria began.Austria and Germany, Karl Polanyi, International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1931-1939) - Vol. 12, No. 5 (Sep., 1933), pp. 575-592 (18 pages), Oxford University Press Borders German-Austria claimed sovereignty over all the majority-German territory of the former Habsburg realm: a total area of with 10.4 million inhabitants. This included nearly all the territory of present- day Austria, plus South Tyrol and the town of Tarvisio, both now in Italy; southern Carinthia and southern Styria, now in Slovenia; Sudetenland and German Bohemia (which later became part of Sudetenland), now in the Czech Republic and East Silesia (now divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia). In practice, however, its authority was limited to the Danubian and Alpine provinces of the old Habsburg realm‚Äîwith few exceptions, most of present-day Austria. On 22 November, the national assembly officially laid claim to all ethnic German areas of Cisleithania. However, the Allies of World War I opposed such a move and German-Austria was largely powerless to resist the forces of Italy, Czechoslovakia, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes from seizing some of its territory. Countries on the winning side of the war took many territories with German majorities. The Czechs ignored principles of ethnic borders and insisted on the historic borders of the Kingdom of Bohemia; thus three million Germans became Czechoslovak citizens, an indirect precipitant of the Sudetenland crisis 20 years later. A victor nation, Italy occupied and was awarded Trentino and South Tyrol, of which South Tyrol is still majority German-speaking. Yugoslavia was given parts of Carinthia and Styria. The Klagenfurt region was retained after a plebiscite on 20 October 1920, when three-fifths of voters voted to remain with Austria. Later plebiscites in the provinces of Tyrol and Salzburg yielded majorities of 98 and 99% in favor of a unification with Germany whereas Vorarlberg in May 1919 held a plebiscite where 81% supported accession to Switzerland. Several German minority populations in Moravia, including German populations in Br√ºnn (Brno), Iglau (Jihlava) and Olm√ºtz (Olomouc), as well as the German enclave of Gottschee in Carniola also attempted to proclaim their union with German- Austria, but failed. The areas now outside of the current Republic of Austria often had significant non-German minorities and occasionally non-German majorities and were quickly taken by troops of the respective countries they were to eventually join. Regarding East Silesia, plans for a plebiscite fell through, and the area was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland. On the other hand, ethnic Germans in the western part of the Kingdom of Hungary that formed a majority in the area known as German West Hungary and agitated to join to Austria were successful and the area became the state of Burgenland, with the notable exception of the region around the city of √ñdenburg (Sopron) which was also intended to be the state capital, but due to a very contentious plebiscite, remained part of Hungary. The only other part of the former German counties of Burgenland in the Kingdom of Hungary also not to become part of the Austrian Republic due to the treaty was Pre√üburg (Bratislava) which went to Czechoslovakia (now the capital of Slovakia).  Subdivisions  German- Austria originally consisted of nine provinces (): #Upper Austria (), all of the current Austrian state of Upper Austria plus the Bohemian Forest region () now in the South Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic; #Lower Austria (), all of the current Austrian state of Lower Austria and the city-state of Vienna, plus German South Moravia (), now divided between the Czech regions of South Bohemia, Vysoƒçina, and South Moravia; #German Bohemia (), areas of western Bohemia that were later part of Sudetenland from 1938‚Äì45, now part of the Czech Republic; #Sudetenland, parts of the historical regions of Moravia and Austrian Silesia. Boundaries do not correspond to later use of the term Sudetenland. #Styria (), most of historical Styria including the current Austrian state of Styria and the north-eastern part of the Slovenian informal region of Lower Styria; #Salzburg, all of the current Austrian state of Salzburg; #Carinthia (), all of historical Carinthia including the current Austrian state of Carinthia, the Slovenian unofficial region of Carinthia, the Slovenian municipality of Jezersko and the now Italian municipalities of Tarvisio, Malborghetto Valbruna and Pontebba; #German Tyrol (), most of historical Tyrol including the current Austrian state of Tyrol and the present-day Italian province of South Tyrol, but not the current Italian province of Trentino; #Vorarlberg, all of the current Austrian state of Vorarlberg.  National anthem  Despite the prohibition of the use of the term \\"German-Austria\\", the republic's unofficial national anthem between 1920 and 1929 was \\"German Austria, you wonderful country\\" (). Its words were penned by then-Chancellor Karl Renner, a signatory of the Treaty of Saint Germain.

Pyarelal Wadali, the younger of the two died on 9 March 2018 at the age of 65 due to cardiac arrest at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, Amritsar. Born into the fifth generation of musicians given to singing the messages of Sufi saints, the Wadali brothers dabbled in the most unexpected of professions before they became Sufi singers. While Puranchand Wadali, the elder brother, was a regular in an akhara (wrestling ring) for 25 years, Pyarelal contributed to the meager family income by playing the role of Krishan in the village Ras Lila. Early life Their father, Thakur Das Wadali, compelled Puranchand to learn music. Puranchand studied music from celebrated masters such as Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan of the Patiala Gharana. Pyarelal was trained by his elder brother, who he considered his guru and mentor up till his death. Career Their first musical performance outside their village was in Harballabh Temple in Jalandhar. In 1975, the duo went to Jalandhar to perform at the Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan but was not allowed to sing because their appearance did not pass muster. Disappointed, they decided to make a musical offering at the Harballabh temple, where an executive of All India Radio, Jalandhar, spotted them and recorded their first song. The Wadali Brothers sing in the gurbani, kafi, ghazal and bhajan genres of music. They live in their ancestral house in Guru Ki Wadali, and teach music to those who promise to preserve it. They do not charge their disciples, and lead a very simple life devoted to the divine one. They believe in the Sufi tradition deeply. They consider themselves as a medium through which the preaching of great saints is passed on to others. They have never indulged commercially, and they have only a handful of recordings to their name (mostly from live concerts). They believe in singing freely as homage to the divine one. They do not feel very comfortable in using electronic gadgets in their music, and stress on Alap and Taans. They believe that spiritual heights can only be attained if you sing unreservedly, in a free atmosphere. Bollywood In 2003, they entered Bollywood, rendering music director and writer Gulzar‚Äôs soulful lyrics in their unique style in the film Pinjar. They also sang one song in Dhoop.

The club engages in several sports: futsal, tennis, and handball, but basketball is by far the most important. History Club Malv√≠n first president was Alberto Nieto. In 1938, the foundation year, Malv√≠n started its sports activity, playing in the Federal Basketball Championship of Fourth Division (organized by the Uruguayan Basketball Federation -Federacion Uruguaya de Basketball-), in the club's first court located in Amazonas street. The first headquarters of the club were located in the crossing of R√≠o de la Plata and Orinoco streets. The second headquarters were ubicated in the crossing of Pilcomayo and Amazonas street. The third headquarters were located in the Orinoco and Amazonas streets. The fourth headquarters were ubicated in Michigan street, between Rambla and Orinoco. In this place, social events that the club organizes nowadays began to be organized, like dances and the Carnaval de Montevideo The development of the club in the institutional aspects was accompanied by a growth in sports. Malv√≠n advanced in the Federal Basketball Championship very fast, gaining its right to play in the First Division in 1942, consolidating itself as one of the most important temas in Uruguayan basketball. In 1947, the construction of the club's stadium was initiated, mainly because the court in Amazonas street was not fit to the requirements of the time. The construction ended on August 30, 1952, with the grand opening of the stadium located in the crossing of the streets Avenida Legrand and Gallinal, with a capacity of 3,000. In 1975, Malv√≠n began a process of renovation that included the passing from amateur to professional basketball and the construction of the tennis courts, the gym and the open pool. In the 90's, the club built its indoor gym, where the home games of the basketball championship are played nowadays. Present situation In the beginning of the 21st century, Club Malv√≠n appears as one of the most important institutions in Uruguay's sports.

It was based on their interpretation of a previously classified document, titled \\"Considerations to the plan of the strategic development of the armed forces of the Soviet Union\\" and dated May 15, 1941, which proposed a strike on Germany.http://osteuropa.bsb- muenchen.de/dig/1000doktest/0024_zuk/@Generic__BookTextView/502;cs=default;ts=default;pt=502 The paper was purportedly composed by Georgy Zhukov, defense commissar, and Semyon Timoshenko, chief of staff, and presented to Joseph Stalin. The publication of this plan has generated much discussion among Russian historians (both in and outside Russia) about Stalin's intended strategy in 1941. Gorkov and Danilov argued that, taking into account Stalin's control of Soviet life, it is highly unlikely that these two high-ranking men would have had such a document prepared without Stalin's explicit authorization. The 1937 purges had decimated the ranks of the higher officers. Danilov suggests that this draft by Zhukov was the basis for Soviet military planning in 1941, and that Stalin intended to strike Germany before the Nazis' Operation Barbarossa took place. Mikhail Meltyukhov, Vladimir Nevezhin and others in post-Soviet nations have also supported this conclusion. But numerous historians in the West, including David Glantz, dispute this conclusion. They concede that war between the Soviet Union and Germany was inevitable, but that the plan represents one scenario. They point to much evidence that the Soviet Union was unprepared to launch such a strike on German-occupied lands in Europe in 1941.

It directed all People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police forces in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Ngari Prefecture in northwest Tibet. It was headquartered in Lanzhou in Gansu Province. It is bordered to the south by the Chengdu Military Region, and to the north by Mongolia, the Altai Republic, which is a political subdivision of the Russian Federation, and Kazakhstan. This region is now part of the Western Theater Command due to the military reforms of 2015.

AECOM has approximately 87,000 employees, and is number 157 on the 2019 Fortune 500 list. The company's official name from 1990 to 2015 was AECOM Technology Corporation, and is now AECOM. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ACM and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol E6Z.  History  AECOM traces its origins to Kentucky-based Ashland Oil & Refining Company, which in turn grew out of Swiss Drilling Company, founded in Oklahoma in 1910 by J. Fred Miles. He gained control of some 200,000 acres and formed Swiss Oil Company in Lexington. In 1924 Miles launched a refining operation called Ashland Refining Company, headed by Paul Blazer. While the parent company struggled, leading to the ouster of Miles, Ashland prospered under Blazer's leadership, and in 1936 he was named chief executive officer of the reorganized company, Ashland Oil & Refining Company. In 1966 Ashland acquired Warren Brothers and became involved in highway construction and construction materials. The company was able to take advantage of refinery byproducts to produce asphalt. Ashland grew into one of the nation's major road-construction firms, and laid a foundation for AECOM. Through a series of acquisitions and technological developments, Ashland grew to include chemical, petrochemical, highway construction, and construction materials firms within its realm, laying the groundwork for a management buyout of Ashland Technology in 1985. In the 1970s Ashland Oil & Refining became Ashland Oil, Inc. Five years later the company consolidated its construction assets into a construction division and also formed a coal subsidiary, indicative of a changing focus at Ashland. Although it generated more than $1 billion a year in sales, Ashland was a small player in the oil industry at a time when the cost of exploration was prohibitively expensive. By 1980, Ashland sold its production assets, and a year later was reorganized as a modified holding company. A new corporate strategy was implemented as Ashland now focused on refining and marketing, and sought to grow its non-refining businesses. In 1984 Ashland acquired Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall (DMJM), a global provider of transportation-related engineering services. Originally focused on military projects, after World War II it had become one of the first integrated engineering and architectural firms in the western United States. The acquisition of DMJM also included its president, Richard G. Newman. In 1985 DMJM became part of a new subsidiary, Ashland Technology Corporation. Two years later Newman was named its new chief executive and president. When Ashland chose to return to its core petroleum refining business in the late 1980s, Newman recommended an employee buyback proposal, resulting in the spin- off of Ashland Technology and the creation of AECOM (Architecture, Engineering, Consulting, Operations, and Maintenance) in 1990. The company went on to acquire a number of engineering, design and planning firms including engineering company Maunsell, urbanism and sustainability practice EDAW, Economic Research Associates (ERA), environmental management firm ENSR and The RETEC Group Inc., architects Ellerbe Becket and Davis Langdon, the quantity surveyors and construction consultants. In 2000, AECOM acquired Metcalf and Eddy, a water and wastewater engineering firm based in Massachusetts, and in September, 2004 it acquired the Canadian company, UMA Engineering Ltd. AECOM went public during May 2007 with an initial public offering on the NYSE, netting $468.3 million. On January 8, 2008 AECOM acquired The Services Group, Inc., a provider of consulting services to the US Agency for International Development and other multi-lateral donor organizations. On July 28, 2008, AECOM completed its purchase of Earth Tech Inc., a consulting and engineering firm, from Tyco International for $510 million. On July 14, 2010, AECOM announced its acquisition of Tishman Construction Corp., a leading provider of construction management services in the United States and the United Arab Emirates, in a $245 million transaction including $202 million in cash and the remainder in AECOM common stock. On July 13, 2014, AECOM announced its acquisition of URS Corporation, an engineering, construction, and technical services firm for US$56.31 per share in cash and stock. Effective July 10, 2014, it acquired ACE International Consultants SL, a Madrid-based provider of consulting services. In July 2014, it acquired Hunt Construction Group, adding to AECOM's construction services business. In July 2017, AECOM acquired Shimmick Construction Company. In October 2019 AECOM announced plans to sell their Management Services division to American Securities LLC and Lindsay Goldberg for $2.405 billion. Management Services provides services and support to governmental clients including the Department of Energy and Department of Defense. On 31 January 2020, this transaction was completed with the new company being called Amentum.https://aecom.com/management-services-sale/  Management  AECOM's first president and CEO was Richard G. Newman, who came to Ashland through its acquisition of Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall (DMJM). Under Ashland Oil's ownership, he was president and chief operating officer of DMJM from October 1985 to December 1988. While president of Ashland Technology Corp. from December 1988 until May 1990, Newman was instrumental in taking it from a division of Ashland Oil to an independent company. He was president when the company changed its name to AECOM Technology Corporation in April 1990. Newman was president until 1993, and then chairman, president and CEO from May 1993 to October 2000, and chairman and CEO from 2000 to 2005.AECOM Technology Corporation.

Dionisio had previously served as COO from October 2003 to October 2005 and president and CEO of the subsidiary DMJM+Harris from October 2000 to October 2003. In October 2011, Michael S. Burke succeeded Dionisio as president and then in March 2014 succeeded him as CEO. Burke joined AECOM in 2005 and was appointed CFO in 2006. In 2011, Stephen M.

Staff artists at the Northampton, Massachusetts based Mirage Studios have provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and are credited on the packaging of the products they created. Getting started The first TMNT license came in the form of a role-playing game by Palladium, followed by miniatures from Dark Horse. Within a year, First Comics began to reprint the early issues in color volumes; four were produced, stopping at issue 11. These sold well, and Eastman and Laird were soon contacted by Mark Freedman, a licensing agent who believed he could make something of the Turtles. Freedman took the idea to a variety of toy companies, only to be turned down by those who felt the concept was not popular enough to support a toy line. Only one company expressed interest, a little-known California company by the name of Playmates Toys. Not entirely willing to risk marketing a small cult comic book, Playmates insisted that a cartoon series be produced first.About the Creators TMNT25.com (January 2009). Retrieved on 1-31-09. Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, famous ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and President of Playmates, Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch \\"Green Against Brick\\". The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers, Walk Kubiak, Aaronian, Schulte and Sachs. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launch to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like \\"Heroes in a Half Shell\\" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans (\\"Turtle Power!\\") came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian. In signing with Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Productions, Eastman and Laird saw the production of the first TMNT cartoon in December 1987. Playmates held up their end of the deal and produced the first series of TMNT action figures in the summer of 1988. The premiere series included the four Turtles, Splinter, April, Shredder, Rocksteady, Bebop, and a Foot Soldier. Vehicles included the Cheapskate, Turtle Trooper, Turtle Blimp, and Foot Knucklehead. Each vehicle set was packaged with a jokebook and a small catalog. If one was to clip the \\"Pizza Point\\"s located on the reverse side of the packaging then a person could redeem them along with a small fee for other Turtles merchandise like VHS tapes, posters, bath towels, among others. Corresponding firmly with its animated series counterpart, the original TMNT action figure line would last ten years and develop a legacy within the toy realm. Overview The first three series of figures took obvious influence from the original Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card on the back of the blister package that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies. With the release of the second series in 1989, fans saw ten entirely new figures: five allies and five enemies, six new vehicles/accessories, the first playset, the Turtle Battle Fun role-play sets, 9\\" and 13\\" plush dolls, and official Retromutagen Ooze. This year also marked the first time Playmates would incorporate action features into their figures along with the first Turtle variants in the \\"Wacky Action\\" sub-line. Each figure possessed a wind-up function that, when applied, caused the figure's limbs to rapidly move in a rhythmic motion. Wacky Action was merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as the new decade of the 1990s dawned Talkin' Turtles, Head Droppin' Turtles, Mutations, Sewer Sports Turtles, and dozens of other fresh ideas began making their way to toy shelves. With such innovations, Ninja Turtle action figures were sure to gain a foothold in the toy market. Vehicles/accessories Considering all of the vehicles and inventions conceived by Donatello, Playmates couldn't have their figures without a slew of toy gadgetry to interact with. Aside from vehicles actually seen in the cartoon, Playmates went on to create a wide variety other accessories. These often expressed the humorous side of TMNT with gadgets commonly made out of sewer lids, trash cans, plungers, and toilet seats. However, vehicles would also include a diversity of play features from the ripcord action of the Psycho Cycle to the electronic launching of the Turtle Pizza Thrower to the smoky bubble spout of the Bubble Bomber. For its time, TMNT was remarkably innovative in terms of fun action figure accessories. In the midst of action figures filling the store shelves, role playing toys were also released. Depending on the depicted character, these typically included a ninja mask and plastic weapons. Other TMNT toys would be sold individually such as the Turtle Communicator, Raphael's Spy goggles, and Leo's Sewer Force Sword. One of the most famous components of the TMNT realm is the radioactive slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to \\"mean, green, fightin' machines.\\" Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a glow-in-the-dark Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation. Aside from the classic \\"Turtle Green,\\" a \\"Purple Foot\\" variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like Muckman, who could have it run from his hollow head and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience. Themes and incarnations Throughout the 1990s, Ninja Turtle action figures would run an extensive gauntlet of different themes and incarnations. Whereas Batman may have become known for hundreds of gadget-wielding action figures, the Ninja Turtles would become synonymous with dozens of historical and pop culture related embodiments; which would be replicated by Kenner in their \\"Legends of Batman\\" line.Batman action figures#Legends of Batman Varying concepts and toy trends resulted in the many examples shown below. *Basic series figures taking on various looks; Leo, the Sewer Samurai, Don, the Undercover Turtle, Mike, the Sewer Surfer, and Raph, the Space Cadet. (1990) Also released with the basic line were the four turtles with Storage Shell. Each action figure had an opening back shell which could store the various accessories each figure was packaged with. Donatello would be released in 1990 and the remaining three the following year. *Mutant Military - Different forms of military - Lieutenant Leo, Pro Pilot Don, Midshipman Mike, and Raph, the Green Teen Beret. (1991) *Rock'n Rollin' - Vibrant musical gimmicks; Classic Rocker Leo, Punker Don, Rappin' Mike, and Heavy metal Raph. (1991) *Sewer Sports All-Stars - Sport- themed figures with action features; Among others, T.D. Tossin' Leo, Slam Dunkin' Don, Shell Slammin' Mike, and Grand Slammin' Raph. (1991) *Wacky Wild West - The Ninja Turtles taking on the Old West; Chief Leo, Crazy Cowboy Don, Bandito-Bashin' Mike, and Sewer Scout Raph.(1992) *Cave-Turtles - Stone Age \\"Collectible Turtle Combo\\" boxsets; Among others, Leo and his Dingy Dino, Don and his Trippy Tyrannosaurus, Mike and his Silly Stegosaurus, and Raph and his Tubular Pterodactyl. (1992-'93) *Turtle Trolls - A take on the early 1990s troll doll craze; Leo, Don, Mike, and Raph featuring tall, synthetic hair and childlike appearances. (1993) *Universal Studios Monsters - Classic monster- themed figures; Among others, Leo as the Wolfman, Don as Dracula, Mike as Frankenstein's monster, Raph as the Mummy, and Bride of Frankenstein April. (1993-'94) *Star Trek - A crossover due to Playmates' owning both Star Trek and TMNT licenses; Captain Leonardo, First Officer (Star Trek) Don, Chief Engineer Michelangelo, and Chief Medical Officer Raphael. (1994) *Adventurers - Figures dressed for adventuring; Deep Sea Diver Leonardo, Arctic Donatello, and Safari Michelangelo. (1995) *Jim Lee's TMNT - Majorly restyled Ninja Turtle figures based on the designs of famous comic book artist Jim Lee. (1995) *Mutant Masters - The Ninja Turtles sporting Anime inspired armor as \\"ancient mythic warriors\\"; Leonardo Wind Warrior, Donatello Water Warrior, Michelangelo Thunder Warrior, and Raphael Fire Warrior. (1997) Even with the silliest of concepts, Playmates managed to create some intriguing and fun figure designs for children. In contrast to other companies like Kenner, who constantly re-released figure sculpts with different paint jobs, Playmates rarely showed a cheap or careless effort in their TMNT figures. But with rising competition, limited figure concepts, and the end of the cartoon series, a pitfall was inevitable. Movie Stars and Toon Turtles By the second, less violent TMNT film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze, Playmates decided to create a figure collection based on the characters' live-action appearance. In contrast to the regular figures, these were made of a softer, more rubbery material to better reflect the look of the animatronic costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, canister of Ooze. In terms of character variety, however, the Movie Stars collections were in stark contrast to the wide variety seen in the basic figure lines. 1992 also saw the production of Toon Turtles. These figures took on an almost stereotypical approach to being humorously cartoon-like. Each character bore a friendly, animated appearance with a glittery paint job and including some type of \\"cartoon\\" action feature (Raphael's head spun, Michelangelo's tongue unraveled in Tex Avery fashion, etc.). On the upside, this series produced a more \\"cartoon accurate\\" painted version of Shredder and introduced toys not previously made for many longtime characters from the cartoon series such as the Neutrinos and April O'Neil's co-workers, Irma Langinstein, Burne Thompson and Vernon Fenwick. A third movie hit theatres in 1993 but saw less success than its predecessors. This collection featured the Ninja Turtles once again in their Movie Star likeness and sporting samurai armor, as well as several other side characters. The Giant Movie III Samurai figures also came complete with removable masks and time scepters as seen in the film. Mini Mutants In 1994, Playmates, in an attempt capitalize on toy lines like Mighty Max and Polly Pocket, shrunk the Turtles down to an equally small size in a sub-line simply named \\"Mini Mutants\\". These were \\"Turtle Transport Combos\\" which contained one figure and two vehicles. \\"Bodacious Battlesets\\" which were four playsets which could connect via bridges/platforms; these included one figure. \\"Turtle Top Playsets\\" were a characters head which would open into a double decker playset; these included three figures. Slimmer \\"Carry Along Playsets\\" took the shape of Raph's sai, Leo's katana, and the Turtle Communicator; these came with three figures. And finally, \\"Turtle in a Turtle\\" consisted of four playsets that were figures of the four turtles about 6 inches taller than the normal figure; their heads, stomachs, and shells opened into the playsets. Each had themed removable armor as well; two figures were included with each. WWE Tie In Playmates also released a series of four special edition WWE themed figures. The line featured only figures of the four turtles, presented in the wrestling attire of famous WWE Wrestlers. This line included: The Undertaker (Don), John Cena (Leo), Sting (wrestler) (Raph), and Macho Man Randy Savage (Mikey).https://www.wwe.com/gallery/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles- wwe-action-figures-photos#fid-40054465 Unproduced toys The original Ninja Turtle line ran for almost ten years and, in that time, various planned items would ultimately not hit toy shelves. Some of these went as far as the prototype stage and being presented at New York Toy Fairs; others had only designs drawn. 1989 * The original Casey Jones figure had an interchangeable head without a detachable mask.

This also went for vehicles and playsets. The scenes from the show were overdubbed with dialogue usually from the actual voice actors that went along with story in the ad. During post movie success, many commercials relied on live-action, animatronic Ninja Turtles similar to those seen in the \\"Coming Out of their Shells\\" Tour. Prime examples of these include 1992 spots for the Bubble Bomber vehicle featuring Raphael in military fatigues and Bodacious Birthday figures where a surprise party was thrown in the Turtles' sewer lair. 1996‚Äì1998: Dry spell By 1996, the cartoon series that lasted nearly a decade had come to an end. The following year, a new live-action series premiered entitled Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation. The series was somewhat short-lived but managed to make for an extensive action figure line. Alongside the basic TMNT characters, this collection of taller scale figures included a female Ninja Turtle named Venus. The show's demise, however, would further confirm the dissolving popularity of the Ninja Turtles, and the franchise would remain in limbo for years to come. Left with a disappointing movie four years prior and virtually no place on television, the TMNT franchise would face a halt in action figure production for several years. 2003‚Äì2012 On February 8, 2003, Fox revived the TMNT franchise with a brand new cartoon series. With it inevitably came a series of action figures. These figures showed reminiscence of those released in 1988 yet with the refreshed design of the new, bold look of the cartoon series. Unlike the previous figures, most of the figures released in this collection actually appeared in the 2003 series. This collection successfully continued into 2006 with new character designs and even an occasional revisiting of past concepts like 1993's Cave-Turtles. In 2006, by request of Playmates, the cartoon series took a new lighter direction which brought Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward, a futuristic take on the heroic mutants. Playmates thought of this change as a means of selling more new Turtles action figures. March 2007 introduced fans to a new CGI feature film entitled simply TMNT. This introduced the Ninja Turtles on-screen to a new generation and corresponded with an extensive action figure line. New figures based on the film continued to be produced into the following year. In September 2007, it was announced that the collectible figure company NECA had acquired the license to produce Ninja Turtle figures based on their character likenesses from the original Mirage comic books. The first wave of figures consisted of the four Turtles and was released in comic and specialty stores in early 2008. The New York Comic Con also boasted an exclusive figure four-pack, and that same year, NECA released black & white versions of the Turtles just as they appeared in the pages of the comics.Cochran, Jay Black & White Teenage Mutant Turtle Figures Coming From NECA TNI News (January 23, 2008).

The station is now part of the South Gippsland Tourist railway, after passenger operations on the line ceased after Cranbourne station in 1993. The station is maintained by volunteers of the South Gippsland Railway, and by a growing number of people within the Loch township. The station presently features a small station building that was formerly located at Welshpool station. It was relocated to the Loch platform in 2003 following the construction of the Loch bypass road. The former station structure when operating as a V/Line service was of the pebble coated concrete Bus Shelter type, on a grass platform, featuring a large tree on the southern end of the platform‚Äîtypical of many small township railway stations. It is understood a more substantial building was at Loch, prior to its sidings and goods facilities being dismantled in the 1970s. Current Status Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha is continuing to feature as a prominent issue for the region.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-13/forums-hears-calls-for-improved- regional-public-transport/6614812 A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 acknowledged that the return of rail as a major community priority where funding and support are sought from all forms of level government.http://www.southgippsland.vic.gov.au/Files/PRIORITY_PROJECTS_2013.pdf In early 2014, a report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee- Rup along the disused Leongatha line as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transportation and rail lobby group established in April 2011 that is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and local forms of government has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. Previously, the group was classified as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993 and the line to Barry Beach and Yarram was formally closed in June 1992 and dismantled by December 1994. One notable milestone that this group achieved in the past was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984.http://www.ptua.org.au/files/newsletters/1980s/PTUA-news-198501.pdf Despite the political promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Steve Bracks led Victorian state Labor government in 1999 being abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby, a public community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group is continuing to lobby and work collaboratively with key stakeholders and governments to reinstate rail services that focuses on improving transport accessibility in the region.

The 'Isawiyya (also Aissawa, Issawa, Aissaoua, Issaoua, Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπŸäÿ≥ÿßŸàŸäÿ©) is a religious Islamic mysticalMartin Lings, What is Sufism? (Lahore: Suhail Academy, 2005; first imp. 1983, second imp. 1999), p.12: \\"Mystics on the other hand-and Sufism is a kind of mysticism-are by definition concerned above all with 'the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven'\\". brotherhood founded in Meknes, Morocco, by Sheikh al- Kamil Mohamed al-Hadi ben Issa (or Aissa) (1465-1526), best known as the Shaykh Al-Kamil, or \\"Perfect Sufi Master\\". The terms Aissawiyya (\`Isawiyya) and Aissawa (\`Isawa), derive from the name of the founder, and respectively designate the brotherhood (tariqa, literally: \\"way\\") and its disciples (fuqara, sing. to fakir, literally: \\"poor\\"). They are known for their spiritual music, which generally comprises songs of religious psalms, characterized by the use of the oboe ghaita (similar to the mizmar or zurna) accompanied by percussion using polyrhythm. Complex ceremonies, which use symbolic dances to bring the participants to ecstatic trance, are held by the Aissawa in private during domestic ritual nights (l√Æla-s), and in public during celebrations of national festivals (the moussem-s, which are also pilgrimages) as well as during folk performances or religious festivities, such as Ramadan, or mawlid, the \\"birth of the Prophet.\\" These are organized by the Moroccan and Algerian States. Founder of the brotherhood: Muhammad Ben Issa Some details regarding Ben Issa remain unknown. He has a hagiography that projects the image of a Sufi master and legendary ascetic of considerable spiritual influence. Ben Issa built his own mausoleum in the monastery or Zaouia in the city of Meknes. This is now a destination for his modern followers to visit and pray while participating in individual or collective acts of piety. Ben Issa was initiated into Sufism by three masters of the tariqa Shadhiliyya/Jazuliyya: Abu al-Abbas Ahmad Al-Hariti (Meknes), Abdelaziz al-Tebaa (Marrakesh) and Muhammad as-Saghir as-Sahli (F√®s). Spiritual doctrine The spiritual doctrine of the Issawa follows the earlier mystical tradition of the tariqa Shadhiliyya/Jazuliyya. This religious teaching first appeared in 15th century Marrakesh and is the most orthodox mystical method to appear in the western region of North Africa known as the Maghreb. Issawa disciples are taught to follow the instruction of their founder by adhering to Sunni Islam and practising additional psalms including the long prayer known as \\"Glory to the Eternal\\" (Al-hizb Subhan Al-Da \`im). The original Issawa doctrine makes no mention of ecstatic or ritual exercises such as music and dance. The mother-monastery of Meknes The Zaouia or monastery in Meknes is the main spiritual centre of the Issawa brotherhood. Founded by Muhammad Ben Issa at the end of the 15th century, construction resumed three centuries later under sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah. Often renovated by the Ministry for Habous and Islamic Affairs and maintained by the municipal services, this is the center of the brotherhood's international network. The site is open to the public all year round and is the location of the tombs of founder Shiekh al- Kamil, his disciple Abu ar-Rawayil, and the alleged son of the founder, Issa Al-Mehdi. International growth Issawa's international growth began in the 18th century. From Morocco, it has spawned organizations in Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Iraq. Outside of these countries, Issawi practice without immediate access to Issawa institutions, as in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, the USA and Canada. There is a building movement in the United States, focused primarily in Chicago. Current situation Theoretically, the brotherhood's network is led from the mother-monastery in Meknes by direct biological descendants of Muhammad Ben Issa. The leader is currently Sidi Allal al-Issawi, a teacher and member of the League of Oulemas of Morocco and Senegal, as well as a poet and historian. In Morocco, the brotherhood - the musicians together with their rituals and music - currently enjoy a particular vogue. The basic cell of the religious order in Morocco is the team (ta \`ifa), which takes the form of a traditional musical orchestra with twenty to fifty disciples. Since a decision taken in the 17th century by the mother-monastery, groups of musicians are placed under the authority of a delegate (muqaddem). There are currently orchestras of the brotherhood across Morocco, but they are especially numerous in the towns of Meknes Fes and Sale, under the authority of the master Haj Azedine Bettahi, who is a well-known Sufi musician.

The Issawa trance ritual : origin and symbolism In Morocco, the ceremonies of the Issawa brotherhood take the form of domestic nightly rituals (known simply as \\"night\\", lila), organized mainly by Imam Shiekh Boulila (Master of the night), at the request of women sympathizers. Women are currently the principal customers of the orchestras of the brotherhood in Morocco. As the Aissawa are supposed to bring to people blessings (\\"barakah\\"), reasons for organizing a ceremony are varied and include celebration of a Muslim festivity, wedding, birth, circumcision, or exorcism, the search for a cure for illness or to make contact with the divine through the extase. Rituals have standardized phases among all the Aissawa orchestras. These include mystical recitations of Sufi litanies and the singing of spiritual poems along with exorcisms, and collective dances. Ludic aspects of the ceremony are attested to by the participants' laughter, songs, and dances, alongside ecstatic emotional demonstrations, which may feature crying and tears. At the symbolic system level, the ceremony represents the initiatory advance of the Sufi on an ascending mystical voyage towards God and the Prophet, then the final return to Earth. This odyssey passes through the world of human beings and that of the jinn to culminate in the higher spheres, where the human meets the divine. According to Aissawa lore, this ceremony was not established nor even practised at the time of Chaykh Al-Kamil. Some members of the brotherhood believe that it emerged in the 17th century at the instigation of Aissaw√Æ disciple S√Æd√Æ \`Abderrahman Tar√Æ Chentr√Æ. Alternatively, it may have appeared in the 18th century under the influence of Moroccan Sufi masters S√Æd√Æ \`Ali Ben Hamd√ªch or S√Æd√Æ Al-Darqaw√Æ, who were both well known for their ecstatic practices. More broadly, the actual trance ritual of the Aissawa brotherhood seems to have been established progressively through the centuries under the three influences of Sufism, pre-Islamic animist beliefs and urban Arab melodic poetry such as the Malhun. Aissawa Moroccans generally avoid deep intellectual and philosophical speculations about Sufism, preferring to attach greater importance to the technical and aesthetic aspects of their music, litanies, poetry and ritual dances. They like to consider their ceremonial space as a safe haven for various artistic elements, for their symbolic system, as well as for the religious traditions of Moroccan culture. Professionalization of Aissawa musicians The early 1990s saw the professionalization of ritual music, which affected both the musicians and their market. This change was possible because the authorities looked on moonlighting and the underground economy favorably. In this context, the Aissawa orchestras exhibit trends that are otherwise difficult to spot in the Moroccan economy. The brotherhood orchestras' moonlighting created a network which makes it possible to define a collective interest, and to test new assumptions regarding economic and social responsibility. Today, through the commercial diffusion of Sufi music, songs, psalms (including during weddings and festivals as well as commercials recordings) and the trade related to crowned divination and exorcism, the Aissawa members establish social integration. Although this phenomenon causes the appearance of new aesthetic standards through more commercial adaptations of mystical psalms, it also leads to the loss of original Sufi doctrines through severe competition between musicians which in turn degrades the social link between the disciples. Commentaries on the Aissawa Many past and contemporary researchers have shown an interest in the Aissawa, particularly from the point of view of studying the religious contours of a Muslim society. Former commentaries on the brotherhood were written in French and Arabic with the first Arab examples being biographical and hagiographic collections compiled between the 14th and 16th century by Moroccan biographers such as Al- Ghazali, Ibn \`Askar, Al-Fassi, Al-Mahdi and Al-Kettani. These texts, which may be handwritten or printed, provide information on the genealogical and spiritual affiliations of the founder of the order, while at the same time enumerating the numerous wonders he realized for the benefit of his sympathizers. Contemporary Arab authors who have studied this topic include Daoui, Al-Malhouni and Aissaw√Æ, who are the current mezwar of the brotherhood in person. These endeavour to put in perspective the Sufi order in the cultural and religious tradition of Morocco through the study of the biography of the founder, and his spiritual doctrine alongside poetic and liturgical texts. The first French writings on the Aissawa appeared at the end of the 19th century following the installation of colonial administration in the Maghreb. The majority of the authors, who were also anthropologists and sociologists, were at that time French and included Pierre-Jacques Andr√©, Alfred Bel, Ren√© Brunel, Octave Depont and Xavier Coppolani, Emile Dermenghem, Edmond Doutt√©, George Drague, Roger Tourneau, Louis Rinn (chief of the Central Service of the indigenous Affairs to the Government General in Algeria at the end of the 19th century), Louis Massignon and Edouard Michaux-Bellaire. These last three authors were military officers with the scientific expedition of the Administration of Indigenous Affairs and their writings are published in the Moroccan Files and the Review of the Muslim World. Among all these French authors, there was also the Finnish anthropologist Edward Westermarck, whose various works are devoted to an analysis of the system of belief and ritual in Morocco. Excepting those authors with a scientific approach, in Morocco and Algeria (to date there has been no study devoted to the Aissawa in Tunisia), the ritual practices of Aissawa drew the attention of and considerably disturbed western observers at the beginning of the 19th century. The brotherhood is evoked here and there in medical works, monographs, schoolbooks, paintings, tests or accounts of voyages. These various writings show a recurring passionate contempt for this type of religiosity. Spiritual dimensions of the brotherhood of Aissawa at that time were never examined, other than by Emile Dermenghem in his acclaimed Le culte des saints dans l'Islam Maghrebin (Paris, 1951). Other texts were only very seldom neutral. By attaching a non-Muslim and archaic label to some brotherhoods (such as the Aissawa but also the Hamadcha and Gnaoua), these writings served to legitimize French prerogatives in the Maghreb. The New Encyclopedia of Islam reports that \\"the scholar of religions, Mircea Eliade, guided by Van Gennep, wrote the observation that the Aissawa are in fact a Maennerbund, that is, a lycanthropic secret society. In other words, werewolves.\\" An 1882 New York Times article, reprinting an account from Blackwood's Magazine, reports lycanthropy and self-injury during an Aissawa ritual in Kairouan: > [O]ne of the Tunisian soldiers ... seized a sword and began to lacerate his > stomach. The blood flowed freely, and he imitated all the time the cries and > movements of the camel. We soon had a wolf, a bear, a hyena, a jackal, a > leopard, and a lion.... A large bottle was broken up and eagerly > devoured.... Twenty different tortures were going on in twenty different > parts of the hall.\\" Contemporary scientific research Some authors of religious history (Jeanmaire) and ethnomusicology (Gilbert Mullet and Andre Boncourt) became interested in the Aissawa in the 1950s and remain so to this day. It was only after Moroccan (1956) and Algerian (1962) independence that contemporary social scientists began to consider the subject. Many articles (Belhaj, Daoui, Hanai, Nabti and Andezian) and theses (Al Malhouni, Boncourt, Lahlou, El Abar, Sagir Janjar and Nabti) as well as ethnographic movies have studied the ritual practices of Aissawa in Morocco. New approaches and prospects An analysis of the work by Sossie Andezian regarding the Aissawa brotherhood and Sufism in Algeria, is considered essential and impossible to circumvent. In her book The Significance of Sufism in Algeria in the aftermath of Independence (2001), Andezian analyzes the processes of reinvention of ritual acts in the context of sociopolitical movements in Algeria. Her reflection leads to a dynamic vision of the religious and mystical rites while highlighting the evolution of the links that people, marginalized in the religious sphere, maintain with the official and textual religious institutions. Continuing the reflexions of Andezian, Mehdi Nabti conducted an investigation inside the Aissawa brotherhood in Morocco in his doctoral thesis entitled The Aissawa brotherhood in urban areas of Morocco: the social and ritual aspects of modern sufism, which is considered a significant contribution to the socio-anthropology of the current Maghreb. Nabti shows the complex modalities of the inscription of the brotherhood in a Moroccan society led by an authoritative government (which try timidly to be liberalized), endemic unemployment, the development of tourism and the progress of political Islamism. While immersing himself as a ritual musician within the Aissawa orchestras, Mehdi Nabti casts new light on knowledge of Sufism and brings invaluable facts on the structure of the brotherhood and its rituals as well as the diverse logic behind affiliation to a traditional religious organization in a modern Muslim society. His work, which offers an iconographic description of musical scores pointing to esoteric symbolism and a DVD documentary, is the greatest sum of knowledge currently available on the subject. Mehdi Nabti is also the leader of the Aissawaniyya Orchestra, which brings together French jazzmen and Aissawa musicians. The band plays concerts all over the world and also conducts master classes.

It is named after the German name Eger for the city of Cheb and the main river Oh≈ôe. The north-western panhandle around the town of A≈° (Asch) was historically part of Vogtland before being incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown in the 16th century; it is thus known as Bohemian Vogtland (German: '; Czech: '). The rest of historic Vogtland is divided between the German states of Saxony, Thuringia and Bavaria. All of Egerland and Vogtland lies within the Euroregion.  Geography  The Egerland forms the northwestern edge of the Czech Republic. Originally, it was a small region of less than around the historic city of Eger, now named Cheb, roughly corresponding with the present-day Cheb District of the Karlovy Vary Region, originally with the exception of A≈°, but including the headwaters of the Oh≈ôe river and the area of Marktredwitz in today's Upper Franconia. In contrast, after the beginning of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Cheb and the historic Egerland were incorporated as part of the \\"Sudetenland\\" into an extended area of . Though the seat of the administration was established at Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) the entity was officially named Regierungsbezirk Eger in order to reduce territorial claims. It included large Bohemian territories up to the outskirts of Plze≈à, comprising cities like Falknov (today Sokolov), Kraslice, Chodov, Mari√°nsk√© L√°znƒõ (Marienbad) and Tachov, which never belonged to historical region. History Cheb castle The settlement of Eger in the Bavaria Slavica was first mentioned in 1061 records of trade routes laid out in the course of the German Ostsiedlung migration. In 1135 the regio Egere is recorded as a part of the Bavarian March of the Nordgau under the rule of Count Diepold III of Vohburg. After his death in 1146, the Egerland was inherited by the later German Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa of Hohenstaufen by marriage with Diepold's daughter Adelheid. The Staufer finally severed the Provincia Egrensis from Bavaria and built it up as an exemplary model of a Reichsgut territory under immediate rule of the Holy Roman Emperor. Along this development Cheb became the site of a Kaiserpfalz residence (Chebsk√Ω hrad), the only one in the present-day Czech Republic. Egerland (Chebsko) as one of the lands of the Bohemian crown. Kingdom of Bohemia Cheb, a free imperial city since 1277, and the Imperially immediate Egerland were given as a lien to King John of Bohemia in 1322 by Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach. In return for John's support against Louis' rival Frederick of Habsburg at the Battle of M√ºhldorf, he received Eger as a ' (Imperial lien) with the \\"guarantee of complete independence from the Kingdom of Bohemia\\". This reservation however became meaningless as Louis never redeemed the pawn, and with the accession of Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg in 1346, the crowns of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia were united in one hand. Charles' successors from the House of Luxembourg and (from 1526) Habsburg continuously eliminated the autonomy of the Egerland against the resistance of the Cheb citizens and the local nobility. While the present-day Franconian parts up to the Fichtelgebirge were acquired by the Principality of Bayreuth under Hohenzollern rule, the remaining territory was administrated within the Bohemian kraj of Loket from 1751. Regierunsgbezirk Eger in cream colour with the remainder of Sudetenland in yellow The incorporation of the Bohemian kingdom into the Habsburg Monarchy had created ongoing conflicts at first along the fault-lines between the Catholic dynasty and the Protestant nobility culminating in the Thirty Years' War. Cheb and the Egerland insisting on their independence tried to maintain a neutral position, they nevertheless were seized as a stronghold by Albrecht von Wallenstein, who was murdered at Cheb on 25 February 1634. In the following decades the absolute Habsburg rulers aimed at a centralized government. Emperor Joseph II of Habsburg on the one hand issued an Edict of Religious Tolerance in 1781, but also denied the Bohemian autonomy by renouncing the ceremony of the coronation as Bohemian king. With the determination of German as official language in all Habsburg lands (instead of Latin), he laid the foundations for future ethnic conflicts. In the course of the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1806 and the onset of the Austrian Empire, the eastern part of Egerland finally became an ordinary district of the Austrian province of Bohemia. The suppression during the Age of Metternich led to a second-class status of the Czech people in the Austrian crown land of Bohemia, despite them being much more numerous than the German-speaking population. From about 1830 on Czech scholars like Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω encouraged the Austroslavism movement demanding autonomy for the Bohemian crown lands and admission of the Czech language. In the aftermath of the 1848 Spring of Nations, the Czechs, as well as some other Slavic nations, began Pan-Slavic movements aiming at complete independence, fiercely opposed by Pan-German organisations like the German Worker's Party based in Cheb. The rise of ethnic nationalism turned out to be fatal, as, while the central parts of Bohemia were only inhabited by a smaller German-speaking elite, in border regions like the Egerland people who spoke the German language were more numerous. Czechoslovakia At the end of World War I, the German-speaking population of former Austria‚ÄìHungary proclaimed the Republic of German Austria including the Egerland and further peripheral regions of German Bohemia, that were to become part of Czechoslovakia. They demanded the unification with Germany, referring to the self-determination doctrine proclaimed by U.S. president Woodrow Wilson that had been the basis for the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Nevertheless, the Czech majority in the total of Bohemia insisted to \\"restore their countries in their historical borders\\", as a revision of the former Germanization. Both parties acted unilaterally, the Czechs prevailed establishing the Czechoslovakian Republic comprising all parts of Bohemia including the Egerland, while the German minority drew a completely new border between predominantly Czech- and predominantly German-speaking parts of the country. With the 1933 Nazi seizure of power in Germany, the separatists of the Sudeten German Party under Konrad Henlein became more and more dominant, calling themselves Sudeten Germans. After Hitler had pushed the situation towards an armed conflict, the prime ministers of Britain and France in the 1938 Munich Agreement backed the annexation of the Sudetenland with the Egerland by Nazi Germany, resulting in flight and expulsion of Czech people. At that time, the term \\"Egerland\\" came in use for the western district of the Sudetenland, itself a Reichsgau from 1939 on. Following the German defeat in World War II, the region was rejoined to Czechoslovakia in 1945 and most of the ethnic Germans were expelled to Germany on the basis of the Bene≈° decrees, nearly 90,000 from Egerland proper and almost 800,000 from the short-lived Regierungsbezirk Eger.

On 11 April 1955, it was damaged in midair by a bomb explosion and crashed into the South China Sea while en route from Bombay, India, and Hong Kong to Jakarta, Indonesia. Sixteen of those on board were killed, while three survived. The target of the assassination was the Chinese Premier, Zhou Enlai, who missed the flight due to a medical emergency and was not on board. Explosion The aircraft departed Hong Kong at 0425 GMT carrying Chinese and Eastern European delegates, mainly journalists, to the Asia-Afro Bandung Conference in Jakarta. At approximately 0925 GMT the crew heard an explosion; smoke quickly entered the cabin from a fire on the right wing directly behind the No. 3 (or right inboard) engine. Upon hearing the explosion and seeing the fire-warning light for the baggage compartment come on, the captain shut off the No. 3 engine and feathered its propeller, fearing the engine would catch fire. This left three engines running. The crew sent out three distress signals giving their position over the Natuna Islands before the radio went dead. The captain tried to land the plane on the sea, but the depressurising cabin and the failing circuits made that impossible. Additionally, smoke was seeping into the cockpit. Left with no other option, the crew issued life jackets and opened the emergency doors to ensure a quick escape as the plane plunged into the sea below. Crash The starboard wing struck water first, tearing the plane into three parts. The aircraft maintenance engineer (ground engineer), navigator and first officer escaped and were later found by the Indonesian Coast Guard. The remaining 16 passengers and crew members, however, drowned at sea. Investigators believed that the explosion had been caused by a time bomb placed aboard the aircraft by a Kuomintang secret agent who was attempting to assassinate Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, who had been scheduled to board the plane to attend the conference but had changed his travel plans at the last minute.  Passengers  Passengers of the chartered flight included three staff members named Li Ping, Shih Chi-Ang and Chung Pu Yun of the Chinese delegation to the Bandung Conference and one staff member of the delegation of the Viet Minh from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The rest of the passengers were journalists ‚Äì five from China, one from Austria Dr. Friedrich Albert (Fritz) Jensen (Jerusalem) an Austrian Communist Party member and veteran of the Spanish Civil War against General Franco. and from Poland, Jeremi Starec\\"G≈Ços Koszali≈Ñski\\", Nr. 91, April 18th 1955, p. 2 (access: 18 September 2020).. Chok-Mui Raymond Wong aka Huang Zuomei, MBE the Hong Kong branch director of Xinhua News Agency, also a former Major in the Hong Kong based communist guerilla unit East River Column was also on the aircraft and is said to have been quite close to Zhou Enlai.  Zhou Enlai  The target of the assassination attempt, Zhou Enlai, had planned to fly from Beijing to Hong Kong and then on to Jakarta on Kashmir Princess. An emergency appendectomy delayed his arrival in Hong Kong; he left China three days after the crash and flew to Rangoon to meet with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu before continuing on to Bandung to attend the conference. Some historians have argued that Zhou may have known about the assassination plot beforehand and that the premier did not undergo an appendectomy at the time. Steve Tsang of Oxford University wrote in the September 1994 edition of The China Quarterly, \\"Evidence now suggests that Zhou knew of the plot beforehand and secretly changed his travel plans, though he did not stop a decoy delegation of lesser cadres from taking his place.\\"\\"Target Zhou Enlai: The \`Kashmir Princess' Incident of 1955,\\" The China Quarterly. Number 139, September 1994.  Investigation  The day after the crash, China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement that described the bombing as \\"a murder by the special service organizations of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek\\"Steve Tsang, The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK (New York: IB Tauris, 2006), 181., while Hong Kong Governor Sir Alexander Grantham maintained that the plane was not tampered with in Hong Kong. However, on 26 May, an Indonesian board of inquiry later announced that a time bomb with an American- made MK-7 detonator was responsible for the crash and it was highly probable that the bomb was placed on the plane in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong authorities offered HK$100,000 for information leading to the arrest of those responsible. They questioned 71 people connected with the servicing of the Air India flight. When police began to focus on Chow Tse-ming, a janitor for Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co., he stowed away to Taiwan on a CIA-owned Civil Air Transport aircraft. The Hong Kong police reported that a warrant charging a murder conspiracy was issued, but the man with the name Chow Tse-ming in the warrant had flown to Taiwan on 18 May 1955, and Chow Tse-ming had three aliases.\\"Police Seek Chinese in Crash Case\\" from Daytona Beach Morning Journal, 3 September 1955 The Hong Kong police concluded that the Kuomintang had recruited Chow to plant the bomb to kill Zhou Enlai. Apparently, he had bragged to friends about his role in the bombing, and had also spent large amounts of money before he left Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Police tried to extradite Chow, but Taiwan refused and denied that Chow was a KMT agent. Steve Tsang collected evidence from British, Taiwanese, American and Hong Kong archives that points directly to KMT agents operating in Hong Kong as the perpetrators of the aircraft bombing. According to him, the KMT had a special- operations group stationed in Hong Kong responsible for assassination and sabotage. Designated the Hong Kong Group under Major-General Kong Hoi-ping, it operated a network of 90 agents. In March 1955, the group recruited Chow for the assassination because his job at the airport gave him easy access to the Air India plane, and offered him HK$600,000 and refuge in Taiwan, if necessary. A Chinese Foreign Ministry document declassified in 2004 also indicates that the KMT secret service was responsible for the bombing. China had from the outset accused the United States of involvement in the bombing, but while the CIA had considered a plan to assassinate Zhou Enlai at this time,Minnick, Wendell L. \\"Target: Zhou Enlai\\", Far Eastern Economic Review, 1995-07-13, pages 54‚Äì55. the Church Committee reported that these plans were disapproved of and \\"strongly censured\\" by Washington.Arthur M. Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1978), 517. In a 1971 face-to-face meeting in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, Zhou directly asked Henry Kissinger about US involvement in the bombing. Kissinger responded, \\"As I told the Prime Minister the last time, he vastly overestimates the competence of the CIA.\\"  Commemorations  The captain of the plane, D.K. Jatar & stewardess Gloria Eva Berry who perished in the crash, later along with co-pilot M.C Dixit & ground maintenance engineer Anant Karnik and navigator J.C. Pathak became the first civilians to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra Award for \\"most conspicuous bravery, daring and self-sacrifice\\". Gloria was the first woman to ever receive the Ashoka Chakra for outstanding bravery. In 2005, the Xinhua News Agency hosted a symposium to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the crash; three Xinhua journalists had been among the victims.

The station has been part of the South Gippsland tourist railway since passenger operations on the line ceased beyond Cranbourne station in July 1993. Current status Between 1999 and 2008 there was constant speculation that the railway line beyond Cranbourne to Leongatha could re-open, as promised by the Victorian State Government, under a project named \\"Bringing Trains Back to Victorians\\". However, in May 2008, a scoping study carried out on behalf of the State Government found the costs of returning services high, at $72 million. Therefore, plans to reopen the line were stopped, and the Government has pledged to spend $14.2 million on improved V/Line coach services in the South Gippsland region instead. Further, there are plans in motion to turn the railway reservation into a Rail Trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora.Communication from Minister Lynne Kosky, Dated June 3, 2008 Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha is continuing to feature as a prominent issue for the region. A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 acknowledged that the return of rail as a major community priority where funding and support are sought from all forms of level government. In early 2014, a report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee-Rup along the disused Leongatha line as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transportation and rail lobby group established in April 2011 that is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and local forms of government has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. Previously, the group was classified as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993 and the line to Barry Beach and Yarram was formally closed in June 1992 and dismantled by December 1994. One notable milestone that this group achieved in the past was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984. Despite the political promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Steve Bracks led Victorian state Labor government in 1999 being abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby, a public community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group is continuing to lobby and work collaboratively with key stakeholders and governments to reinstate rail services that focuses on improving transport accessibility in the region. Location Korumburra Railway Station is located on Station Street, off Bridge Street, Korumburra. Bridge street can be accessed from the South Gippsland Highway Bridge Street is named after the road overpass bridge that crosses the railway line, dividing the eastern and western halves of the town. The station contains a well preserved red brick station, large goods yard, a fully working turntable and goods shed. The station building currently enjoys a heritage listing, and the station's 100th birthday was in January 2008. Korumburra Railway Station features a Railway Museum, featuring railway artifacts and items from the entire South Gippsland Line. Various items have been donated from people throughout the district. An additional ongoing display is a photographic exhibition featuring images of railway infrastructure, vehicles and railway workers in action from Koo-Wee-Rup through to Foster and beyond‚Äîall prior to the 1994 closure of the line. As well as the many freight trains that ran on the line superphosphate special trains were commonly stabled at the Korumburra Yards. Superphosphate trains would run around Winter months and transported many goods products, farming produce, fertilizer, oil, explosives, super, grain, cement and many more products. Public transport services Upon the closure of the railway stations for regular passenger traffic, the V/Line coach stop was located outside the Korumburra station in Station Street. Changes to services and streamlining of coach services meant the change of V/Line coach stops along the route, with Korumburra's coach stop being moved from the Korumburra Station to the main street. A second bus-stop is now located outside the Coal Creek Community Park and Museum on the corner of Silkstone Road and the South Gippsland Highway.

It was sold from June 1979 to December 1982. Approximately 380,000 II Pluses were sold during its four years in production before being replaced by the IIe in 1983. Features Memory The Apple II Plus shipped with 16 KB, 32 KB or 48 KB of main RAM, expandable to 64 KB by means of the Language Card, an expansion card that could be installed in the computer's slot 0. The Apple's 6502 microprocessor could support a maximum of 64 KB of address space, and a machine with 48KB RAM reached this limit because of the additional 12 KB of read-only memory and 4 KB of I/O addresses. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine's built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3's and commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The Language Card was also required to use LOGO, Apple Pascal, and FORTRAN 77. Apple Pascal and FORTRAN ran under a non-DOS operating system based on UCSD P-System, which had its own disk format and included a \\"virtual machine\\" that allowed it to run on many different types of hardware. First-year Apple II Pluses retained the original Apple II's jumper blocks to select the RAM size, but a drop in memory prices during 1980 resulted in all machines being shipped with 48k and the jumper blocks being removed. CP/M Shortly after the introduction of the II Plus in 1979, Microsoft came out with the Z-80 SoftCard, an expansion card for the Apple II line that allowed the use of CP/M and contained its own Z80 CPU and logic to adapt the Z80 CPU to the Apple bus. The SoftCard was extremely popular and Microsoft's single most successful product for two years, although on the downside, it was limited to using the Apple II's GCR disk format and thus CP/M software either had to be obtained on Apple format disks or transferred via serial link from a different machine running CP/M. The SoftCard shipped with CP/M 2.2 and a special version of MBASIC that supported a subset of Applesoft BASIC's graphics commands. Other third party CP/M cards for the Apple II offered additional memory, CP/M 3.0, and CPU speeds up to 8 MHz. Onboard Applesoft BASIC The II Plus had the so- called \\"Autostart ROMs\\", meaning that it will attempt to boot from disk on power-up. If no system disk is present, Drive 0 will spin endlessly until the user presses Ctrl+Reset to enter Applesoft BASIC. If DOS has not been booted up, the user will only be able to load and save files to cassette from BASIC. The II Plus had a revised version of BASIC known as Applesoft II which incorporated most of the functionality from Integer BASIC, including HGR graphics commands. Most II Pluses came with a \\"language card\\". This was completely different from the language card sold for the original II, which contained Applesoft BASIC in ROM. Since the II Plus already had Applesoft present in the ROMs on the system board, its language card contained RAM rather than ROM and if installed will boost the system to 64k. While on the original II, Integer BASIC resided in ROM at $E000, this area contains RAM on the II Plus if a language card is present. Integer BASIC is not in ROM on the II Plus and is instead loaded by DOS 3.x during boot up into the RAM at $D000 (if a language card is present, otherwise this step is skipped--II Pluses without a language card cannot run Integer BASIC). Normally, the RAM containing Integer BASIC is banked out and the Applesoft ROM is present at $D000. If the user types \\"INT\\", Integer BASIC is activated by swapping out the Applesoft ROM and switching in the RAM with Integer BASIC. By typing \\"FP\\", Integer BASIC is switched out and Applesoft switched back in. The machine language monitor at $F800 may also be banked out for RAM. Substitute lowercase functionality Like the Apple II, the Apple II Plus has no lowercase functionality. All letters from the keyboard are upper-case, there is no caps lock key, and there are no lowercase letters in the text-mode font stored in the computer's ROM. To display lowercase letters, some applications run in the slower hi-res graphics mode and use a custom font, rather than running in the fast text mode using the font in ROM. Other programs, primarily those where both capitalization and text movement were important, such as word processors, use inverse text mode to represent text that would be uppercase when printed. Alternatively, users can install a custom ROM chip that contained lowercase letters in the font, or purchase one of several third- party 80-column cards that enable a text mode that can display 80-column, upper- and lower-case text. The Videx Videoterm and its many clones were especially popular. For lowercase input, since it is not possible to detect whether the keyboard's Shift keys are in use, the common \\"shift-key mod\\" connects the Shift key to one of the pins on the motherboard's paddle connector. Compatible applications, including nearly all word processors, can then detect whether the shift key was being pressed. This modification involves adding wires inside the Apple II; Apple distributed literature on how to build it, however, assuring readers that it was \\"the most simple and least expensive addition anyone could do\\". Most applications that support lower-case letters can also use the ESC key as a substitute lowercase toggle if the modification is not installed. Repeat key The Apple II Plus, like its predecessor the Apple II, features a repeat key on its keyboard. The key is labeled \\"REPT\\" and is located just to the left of the \\"RETURN\\" key. The II Plus is the last Apple Computer to have this key, as later Apple computers would incorporate the ability to hold down a key for a period of time to repeat the key. Electromagnetic shielding The II Plus has a plastic case with a brass mesh running along the inside of the case. This mesh helped reduce the electromagnetic interference emitted from the computer, keeping the machine in compliance with newly implemented FCC regulations covering microcomputers. Small grids of plastic pins, and sometimes Velcro¬Æ Brand Fasteners, were used to hold the case's top onto the computer. In comparison, the original Apple II lacked RF shielding and was often unusable with certain TVs and monitors (Apple recommended Sony TVs as they had better RF insulation than other brands). Variants Apple II Europlus and J-Plus After the success of the first Apple II in the United States, Apple expanded its market to include Europe and the Far East in 1978, with the Apple II Europlus (Europe) and the Apple II J-Plus (Japan). In these models, Apple made the necessary hardware, software and firmware changes in order to comply with standards outside of the US and Canada. The power supply was modified to accept the local voltage, and in the European model the video output signal was changed from color NTSC to monochrome PAL by changing some jumpers on the motherboard and using a slightly different frequency crystal oscillator ‚Äî an extra video card (which only worked in slot 7) was needed for color PAL graphics, since the simple tricks designer Steve Wozniak had used to generate a pseudo-NTSC signal with minimal hardware did not carry over to the more complex PAL system. In the Japanese version of the international Apple, the character ROM and the keyboard layout were changed to allow for Katakana writing (full Kanji support was clearly beyond the capabilities of the machine), but in most other countries the international Apple was sold with an unmodified American keyboard; thus the German model still lacked the umlauts, for example, and had a QWERTY layout instead of the standard German QWERTZ. For the most part, the Apple II Europlus and J-Plus were identical to the Apple II Plus and software compatibility was near 100%. Production of the Europlus ended in 1983. ITT 2020 The ITT 2020 was an Apple II clone manufactured by ITT under license from Apple Computer (the first licensed clone), specifically for the European market. In contrast to the Apple II Europlus, the ITT 2020 supported full PAL color graphics Bell & Howell Bell & Howell Apple II Plus The Apple II Plus was also sold by Bell & Howell specifically to educational markets under special license from Apple. The standard Apple II Plus was not UL-listed because the top could be opened; the B&H; model was the same as the consumer version sold by Apple except that it came in a black case, which could not be opened as easily, and a special A/V package allowing it to be sold as audio/visual equipment. Bell & Howell packaged the unit with optional \\"back packs\\" that offered various inputs and outputs for A/V equipment to easily interface with the II Plus.Apple II Plus - Bell & Howell Model This was the only black computer Apple would manufacture until the Macintosh TV in 1993. Military applications A TEMPEST-approved version of the Apple II Plus was created in 1980 by the Georgia Tech Research Institute for U.S. Army FORSCOM, and used as a component in the earliest versions of the Microfix system. Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using video disc (Laserdisc) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as order of battle, airfields, roadways, and bridges.

Maiden Moor is a fell in the English Lake District, it stands south of the town of Keswick and is part of the high ground that separates the Newlands Valley and Borrowdale, it has a modest height of and so fails to be mentioned on many UK mountain lists but it does have a separate chapter in Alfred Wainwright‚Äôs Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. Name The meaning of the fell's name is obscure, the name \\"Maiden\\" is given to many prehistoric hill forts but there is no evidence that a hill fort ever existed on the fell, it may refer to a place where games or rituals were played where maidens took part. Topography The fell's main natural features are Bull Crag which lies below the summit on the Newlands side and the hollow of Yewthwaite Combe which stands beneath the col linking the fell with Catbells on the Newlands side. Geology The Maiden Moor ridge is an example of the Buttermere Formation, an olistostrome of disrupted, sheared and folded mudstone, siltstone and sandstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Mining and Mrs Tiggy-Winkle The Combe is the site of the disused Yewthwaite lead mine and there are extensive spoil heaps and old adits and shafts. The mine opened in the late 18th century and closed in 1893. This mine area was made famous by Beatrix Potter as the location of the story \\"The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle\\", the story she dedicated to Lucy Carr, daughter of the vicar of Newlands Church, Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is supposed to have lived in one of the holes in the fell above the mine. Ascents Maiden Moor stands between two well known fells (Catbells and High Spy) and is part of the popular Newlands horseshoe walk, so it is often approached along the ridge from other fells by walkers whose main objective is a longer walk. However the fell can be climbed directly from Grange in Borrowdale and Little Town in the Newlands valley. Both routes climb to the col (Hause Gate) linking the fell to Catbells and then ascend by the northern ridge. Approaching the top of the fell the path splits with the main path continuing to High Spy without (unusually) going over the highest point of the fell. The right hand fork follows the escarpment above Newlands to reach the summit which is crowned by a small cairn. Summit There is no easy way of discerning the exact highest point as the top is a level grassy plateau. There are excellent views across the Newlands valley to the Coledale fells and beyond.

The company began as a brewpub in Lyons, Colorado in 1997 and began brewing beer in the basement in 1999. In 2002, they became one of the first to put their own craft beer in cans. In 2012, they began marketing some of their craft beer in resealable aluminum containers, and in 2012, they expanded and established another brewery in Brevard, North Carolina. History Oskar Blues Original Grill & Brew Restaurant was founded by Dale Katechis in Lyons, Colorado in 1997. Two years later, he began brewing beer in the basement of the restaurant. Some credit Oskar Blues as the creator of the \\"first released canned craft beer in the United States\\" with the release of their Dale's Pale Ale in November 2002. Other writers point to an earlier beer, Chief Oshkosh Red Lager which was brewed and canned at an existing brewery, as the \\"first canned craft beer\\" on June 17, 1991, although its producer, the Mid-Coast Brewing company, closed in 1994. Four other companies produced canned craft beers prior to Oskar Blues, although the canning was done by larger companies under contract. Regardless of the first, by 2011 about 50 U.S. craft brewers were issuing craft beer in cans. In 2009, Oskar Blues Brewery sponsored an event called \\"Burning Can\\" which brought together other craft brewers who were using cans for their beers. In 2012 Oskar Blues Brewery began using resealable aluminum containers for craft beer. Advertising Age named them one of the hottest brands of the year in 2010; Inc. magazine put them on the list of fastest-growing companies and they were featured on the cover of Market Watch magazine. They are the largest craft brewery (by volume) in the U.S. to abstain from using glass bottles. In 2011, they produced and canned 59,000 barrels of beer. In 2013, they employed over 275 people and distributed to 32 states. The company was ranked Colorado's second largest craft brewery and the 27th largest in the U.S. in 2012. and predicted they would brew 141,000 barrels of beer in 2013. The Colorado facility grew to by 2013. In 2013, they opened a satellite brewery in Brevard, North Carolina, with an initial production of 40,000 barrels which is capable of being scaled to 85,000. Forty-five thousand barrels of beer were brewed at the Brevard brewery in 2013, the first full year of production, and the company plans to increase that to 120,000. The Longmont factory is available for tours, and features the Oskar Blues Tasty Weasel Taproom overlooking the brewery. The original Oskar Blues Grill and Brew is still located in Lyons, with 45 beers on tap. In December 2018, Oskar Blues announced the launch of the \\"first national craft hard seltzer\\" named Wild Basin Boozy Sparkling Water.  Beers  Oskar Blues Brewery brews eight year-round production beers, brewed in 100 and 200 barrel batches. The original brew pub provides a variety of smaller batches for consumption at the Lyons and Longmont locations. *Dale's Pale Ale was Oskar Blues' first beer. It is somewhere between an American pale ale and an India Pale Ale brewed with European malts and American hops. In 2005, Dale's Pale Ale was named \\"Best Pale Ale by the New York Times. Esquire magazine selected Dale's as one of the \\"Best Canned Beers to Drink Now\\" in a February 2012 article. Dale's is 6.5% alcohol by volume, and features 65 International Bittering Units (IBUs). Dale Katechis first brewed Dale's Pale Ale in his bathtub while a student at Auburn University.Top American craft beer was first brewed in an Auburn bathtub: The War Eagle Reader In a 2003 interview, Dale confirmed that coworker Brian Lutz formulated the recipe for the beer.: Real Beer *Old Chub is a Scotch ale brewed with seven different malts, including crystal and chocolate malts. Old Chub also gets a dash of beechwood-smoked grains imported from Bamburg, Germany. Old Chub is 8% alcohol by volume. Among other medals, Old Chub won a bronze medal in the 2011 Great American Beer Festival Scotch Ale Category. It was originally named HYA (for \\"here's your ass\\") and renamed \\"Old Chub\\" when it went into production. *G'Knight is a hybrid version of strong ale, somewhere between an Imperial Red and a Double IPA. Oskar Blues makes it with six different malts and three types of hops, then dry-hopped it with Amarillo hops. It is 8.7% alcohol by volume, and has 60 International Bittering Units. G'Knight is brewed in tribute to the late Gordon Knight. In addition to opening some of Colorado's first microbreweries, Knight was a Vietnam vet and huge promoter of craft beer. He lost his life in 2002 while fighting a wild fire outside of Lyons, Colorado. In 2013, Oskar Blues Brewery had to change the name of this beer from Gordon Knight to G'Knight following actions from the Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant Group seven years after the beer was first produced. *Ten FIDY Imperial Stout is Oskar Blues' seasonal beer with flavors of chocolate, malt, coffee, cocoa and oats. Ten FIDY is 10.5% ABV (hence the name) and is made with two-row malts, chocolate malts, roasted barley, flaked oats and hops with 98 IBUs. *Mama's Little Yella Pils is a small-batch pilsner.

Hull in his 1943 book titled Principles of Behavior. He defined it as: Reactive inhibition is typically studied in the context of drive reduction. Hull likens it to fatigue through which humans become tired over time and thus less accurate and precise within a given task. There is significant debate whether the process of reactive inhibition is due to fatigue or some other process. Nevertheless, it is a factor researchers need to consider in analyses of sustained performance due to its possible role in the results and analysis of research. Hull goes onto to further explain the decay of performance through the use of a decay formula which can estimate the rate of performance deterioration. Hull explains: I dissipates exponentially with time t: > With the passage of time since its formation IR spontaneously dissipates > approximately as a simple decay function of the time t elapsed, i.e., :I'_R > = I_R x 10^{-at} (Hull, 1951, p. 74). Hull's decay formula is somewhat awkward and might give rise to confusion. For example, I'R does not refer to the derivative of IR. A more convenient way of writing the formula would be as follows: :I(t) = I(0) e^{-bt} with b = a \\\\ln (10). I(0) is the inhibition at the beginning the time interval [0,t]. Note that if one takes the natural logarithm of both sides one obtains: :Y(t) = Y(0) - bt where Y(t) = \\\\ln I(t) and Y(0) = \\\\ln I(0). The last formula is used in inhibition theory. Reactive inhibition is distinct from proactive inhibition. Reactive inhibition occurs after an initial response has been activated and set to be carried out. In contrast, proactive inhibition determines whether or not the response process is activated in the future and occurs before initial activation. Reactive inhibition is considered to be a bottom-up processing process and associated with ‚Äúlower level mechanisms of inhibition‚Äù, whereas proactive inhibition is considered more top-down processing and dealing with ‚Äúhigher level mechanisms‚Äù.  Applications  Reactive inhibition may be important in everyday life during a process in which a decline in performance can be detrimental such as driving a car during rush hour. For example, Kathaus, Washcer, & Getzmann (2018) found that older adults who showed a tendency towards reactive inhibition, determined through electroencephalography measures, showed higher ‚Äúdriving lane variability‚Äù and more impairment. Although older adults matched younger adults in their lane keeping abilities, they were unable to change lanes as effectively when they relied on reactive inhibition. Another study also revolving around younger vs older adults in the realm of inhibition found that older adults had decreased reactive inhibition but sustain proactive inhibition overall. By using a smart phone app, participants played a game in two apples were falling from either side of the tree. They were to tap either apple but not press one of the apples if that apple turned brown or ‚Äúrotten‚Äù. This is similar to a Stop Signal Task as described below. Some of these trials were primed for a person to expect a change and others not. What was found was a decreased ability in older adults to inhibit an action when they were not primed thus indicating a deficit in reactive inhibition. Researchers have also studied reactive inhibition within the context of ADHD. It is commonly accepted that decreased inhibition abilities are a prominent aspect of the symptoms associated with ADHD. Within the context of the Stop Signal Task studies point to an inability to switch attention the signal switches from a go signal, to stop, which can be compared to environmental changes in the world. Further, it is proven that reactive inhibition in particular is affected in individuals with ADHD and related ADHD symptoms, and may not even have an impact on proactive inhibition at all. The ability to inhibit can impact children‚Äôs learning abilities and is a lack of reactive inhibition is present in many learning disorders.  Relationship to learning  Reactive inhibition is also related to repetition performance, including learning. For example, Torok et al. (2017) recorded learning capabilities in 180 adults using the Alternating Serial Reaction Time Test. Results showed reactive inhibition had a profound effect on performance. Specifically, they showed that significantly more learning had occurred than was perceived at the end of the task, for reactive inhibition had effected the individual over time. They concluded that reactive inhibition may affect one‚Äôs rate of learning due to how it causes progressive decline within a task. It was stated to be a feature of performance within 90% of the participants, and thus playing a significant role in results. These findings have caused some researchers to question existing psychological theories. For example, Rickard, Pan, and Albarrac√≠n present evidence that even well accepted psychological findings such as memory consolidation during sleep may be incorrect. The increase in ‚Äúmemory‚Äù that supposedly occurs after sleep may just be due to reactive inhibition. It may have existed at the end of learning before sleeping occurred, and thus caused seemingly lower memory scores. Reactive inhibition is often not recognized as a factor of performance in learning based experiments and thus can lead to incorrect results. The presence of reactive inhibition can result in decreased performance over time and thus decrease the level of supposed learning. If tested at a later time, however, when reactive inhibition is not present one may see true measures of learning.  Stop-signal task (SST)  Reactive inhibition within experimental settings is most commonly measured through the stop-signal task (SST). In the SST, a ‚Äúgo-signal‚Äù is presented to the participant to indicate that he or she should complete an action. Then, in some instances, a ‚Äústop-signal‚Äù is also presented to the participant indicate he or she should abandon the previously initiated action. This stop signal is presented within hundreds of milliseconds of receiving the go signal. What is important within this task is the stop signal reaction time, which indicates how long it takes reactive inhibition to be triggered and thus for the action to be ceased. Shorter times indicate a person has better reactive inhibition skills, and thus able to more quickly switch from the activation of some response to the abandoning of that goal through reactive inhibition. Due to the simplicity of the SST some modern researchers are against its use to make broader assumptions about inhibition. The SST‚Äôs demands on attention and inhibition are relatively low and simple in nature, unlike many real life situations, which makes them distrusting of its results. However, the SST is thought to be more indicative by many of reactive inhibition as opposed to proactive. In addition, reactive inhibition is thought to involve mechanisms that are not context dependent but generally the same amongst many conditions in which contexts are changing and the original ‚Äúgo-signal‚Äù explicitly or implicitly stated.  Relationship with Parkinson's Disease  Reactive inhibition is negatively affected by Parkinson's disease. People with Parkinson‚Äôs disease have difficulty inhibiting their behaviors. It is proposed that levels of Dopamine are directly associated with one‚Äôs ability to inhibit. Proper inhibition is believed to be successful at some desired level of dopamine. Using the simon task, researchers showed that inhibitory processes were significantly depleted in Parkinson‚Äôs patients who were withdrawing from their medications, and thus experiencing low levels of dopamine. Performance has been also depleted among high levels of dopamine, indicating that there is an ideal middle ground level of dopamine in which reactive inhibition is most successful. These results suggest an association between dopamine levels and reactive inhibition.  Brain involvement  Reactive inhibition appears to be related to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), particularly within the active inhibition of ‚Äúoverriding the behavior‚Äù. The STN is in charge of sending a signal to ‚Äúinhibit thalamo-cortical activation‚Äù. Thus reaction then causes GABA driven inhibitory signals to be sent to the thalamus which inhibits the behavior. Although reactive inhibition is supported by early STN activity relative to the time of responses, proactive inhibition is defined by more continuous STN activity. One study has also shown that significant damage to the prefrontal cortex, particularly the right superior medial frontal region, can result in a lack of inhibitory control. When this particular region was damaged patients relied more on last second reactive inhibition to avoid performing inappropriate behaviors.

The band has competed in Grade 1 since being promoted to that level in 1980. Throughout its competitive history, the band has not won the World Pipe Band Championships, though it has been runner up four times and has won the drum corps prize 6 times to date under Tom Brown MBE and his son Gordon Brown.  History  In 1972, a few townspeople of Boghall in West Lothian decided that they would try to form a pipe band. An advertisement was put in the local newspaper for young people wanting to learn the pipes or drums, and a group of primarily young players began practising at a Bathgate school. As with many youth bands, numerous adults and committee members from the community were necessary to keep the band running during its early years. The band rose quickly through the lower grades and a Novice grade band was created in 1977 to handle additional youth who were joining the band. By 1978, the original band had won the Champion of Champions title in Grade Two while the Novice band was upgraded to Juvenile. The senior band was promoted to Grade 1 in 1980, and throughout the subsequent decade its drum corps won every single major drumming prize. The band as a whole proceeded to win the Scottish, British and European Championships during that decade. Band The Pipe Major of the band is Ross Harvey, who joined the band in 1994 and became pipe major at the end of the 2015 season. The Leading Drummer is Gordon Brown. Performances The band travelled to Ontario in 2013 for the 50th anniversary of the Cobourg Highland Games, to compete and perform in concert. Individual members of the band have also been successful in solo competitions. Results The band has won awards in Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as at Juvenile and Novice Juvenile levels.

Mooney played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team that qualified for the 1983 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship where despite remaining unbeaten in a group that included eventual winners France they were eliminated. Mooney scoring against the French at Elland Road. He also played at the 1984 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship. Liverpool Having signed for Liverpool, Mooney immediately started to turn heads with some outstanding performances for Liverpool F.C. Reserves even breaking into the Republic of Ireland U-21s side after starring and scoring in the 1985 FIFA World Youth Championship. Breaking into the Liverpool first team however was a different matter. With a team consisting of Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Craig Johnston, Ronnie Whelan and the like coupled with the fact that they were at the time the top club side in Europe it became increasingly difficult for Mooney to make a breakthrough playing in the end just one first team game in a Football League Cup tie against Fulham in October 1986. Even a successful loan spell in 1986 at Wrexham (8 games, 2 goals) only added to Mooney's desperate need for regular first team action. However, in October 1987 things took a turn for the better. The Preston years With newly promoted Preston North End struggling in the English third division manager John McGrath brought in both Mooney and Tony Ellis with Mooney initially on a months loan. Both players were an instant success with Mooney becoming the darling of the Deepdale terraces. At the end of his loan spell Liverpool agreed to sell Mooney for the moderate fee of ¬£25,000. The next three and a half years were for Mooney a very successful period with his undoubted natural ability attracting the attention of many top flight clubs and the eye of Republic of Ireland boss Jack Charlton. In all, Mooney played 128 games for Preston scoring 26 goals and was named the club's official player of the year in 1988‚Äì89.

His time at Sunderland was however a disaster with the club being relegated almost immediately and Mooney managing just 27 appearances (1 goal) in an injury ravaged two years. A loan spell at Burnley F.C. didn't help either with a now disillusioned Mooney dead set against the move, however with Sunderland wanting Mooney to play competitive games he did in his month there make 6 appearances for the Turf Moor outfit without scoring. Injury and poor form put pay to Mooney's career at Roker Park and although at the end of his contract there was interest from several other English clubs, Peterborough United being the most notable, Mooney decided that at the age of 27 to return to Ireland. Back home Upon his return to Ireland, Mooney signed for Shelbourne F.C.. He scored in two consecutive rounds in the 1993‚Äì94 European Cup Winners' Cup. He then transferred to Bohemian F.C. in 1995 amid controversy . His last game for Bohs was in a relegation playoff in 1999 and he was then released .

It consists of covers of Bob Dylan songs. Background Odetta was a Civil rights activist. Although she grew up in the city, she described black folk music and spirituals as ‚Äúliberation songs\\" and used this music to ‚Äúdo my teaching and preaching, my propagandizing.‚Äù Both Odetta and Bob Dylan sang at the 1963 Civil Rights March in Washington DC. When this album was recorded, Bob Dylan was only just turning away from the protest singer phase and had not yet released music done with electric instruments. His songs \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (which Odetta had recorded earlier) and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin‚Äô\\" were still anthems of the civil rights movement, and \\"With God on Our Side\\" and \\"Masters of War\\" longer, bitter anti-war songs. Yet Odetta also made sure to include love songs, and other not obviously political tracks written by Bob Dylan, transformed by her powerful voice. In addition to a number of well-known Dylan compositions, a couple of fairly obscure songs were included, including \\"Baby, I'm in the Mood for You\\". This album was re-released on CD in the UK by RCA Records in 2000. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (which first appeared on Odetta Sings Folk Songs, 1963) and \\"Paths of Victory\\" (Odetta Sings of Many Things, 1964) were added as bonus tracks. Reception In his review for Allmusic, critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the album, \\"other than an obscure 1964 album by Linda Mason, it was the very first album of Dylan covers. And in part it was because, unlike most of the artists who would take a swing at the concept, Odetta was actually a major folk musician, one who had done much to inspire Dylan himself.

Mochi Gate is a historical gate built by the Mughals. It is at the site of one of the thirteen gates of the old walled city of Lahore.The Darwaza (Gate) used to exist next to the Laal Haveli,Imambargah Akbar Ali shah, a prominent landmark at the entrance point. In Urdu, Mochi means cobbler (Cavalry Saddles and shoes repair person) which indicates that the bazaar was a market for shoes and repair shops. Mochi Gate is also known for ancient Mosque of Muhammad Saleh Kamboh, teacher of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. According to a legend it is named after Moti, a guard of the gate during the Mughal era, who guarded and looked after the gate all his life. The most likely origin of its name, however, seems to be from the word Morchi, which means trench soldier. The Governor's \\"Piada\\" units were stationed here during the pre-Mughal dynasty rule. This is further borne by the fact that the different streets (Mohalla's) which still bear their old names are the Mohalla Teer-garan (arrow craftsmen), Mohalla Kaman-garan (bow craftsmen). The bazaar around the Mochi gate is renowned for its shops of Dried fruit, kites and fireworks Further inside is the Mohalla Shia, where the traditional Shia (Islamic sect)of Lahore still gather annually, at Moharram (first lunar month of the Islamic calendar) to carry out the Majaalis (Shia religious gatherings) and Maatum (self chest beating)to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. A number of Imaam Bargahs in the form of Haveli's are situated here. Apart from their religious significance, some are a masterpiece depicting the architecture of their times. Mubarak Haveli, Nisar Haveli and Laal Haveli are, but a few examples. A Kebab Shop (Saeein Kabab wala), a sweet mart (Fazal Sweets and Rafiq Sweets) and an Old Khoo (water well)(Lal Khoo) are some of the well known features of Mohalla Shia. In front of the Laal Haveli is the Mochi Baagh. This, until recently, was a lush green patch with shady trees, it is barren now due to its landscaping to become a \\"speaker's corner\\" in the light of its history of it having numerous renowned political leaders addressing the crowds at this place. Now this garden (baagh) is used for wedding ceremonies by locals and for playing cricket by the local boys. Mochi Baagh Mochi Baagh/Garden (ŸÖŸà⁄Ü€å ÿ®ÿßÿ∫) is Pakistan's most famous political rally spot. Mochi Baagh is located on the immediate right of Mochi Gate. Many renowned political leaders of Pakistan and the pre-independence era have delivered speeches here. Until the late 1980s, it was commonly held that unless a politician could deliver a speech to a packed Mochi Baagh crowd s/he was not worth his/her political salt. Currently, Mochi Baagh has been spoiled by the right half of it being encroached upon by heavy duty truck drivers using it as a parking stand in violation of public area laws. In March 2007, the PHA (Parks and Horticultural Authority) announced that maintenance works would be carried out in Mochi Baagh. Works proposed include the construction of a 27x33 (feet) stage, maintenance of stairs around the park, setting up of fountains, jogging tracks, the installation of benches and lights and the planting of grass.

Marie is a very talented pianist who has been playing in public since the age of twelve and has even had the privilege of playing in duet with Paderewski Ignacy Jan Paderewski. She is married to the Armenian WWI hero and writer Levon Tutundjian [de Vartavan] and lives in Lausanne with him in Cornette de Bise. She teaches at the Ribeaupierre Institute, a higher music school in Lausanne founded in 1915 by Mathilde and √âmile de Ribeaupierre. The same year Em√°nuel Mo√≥r sparks a lively controversy in the world of music by presenting two revolutionary inventions in quick succession. First, \\"a giant violin, one and a half meters long, with five to six strings to reach the length of the cello, the bow being moved by a pedal\\". The possibility of his employment in the orchestra prompted ironic comments from a critic of the Lausanne Gazette. Marie, for her part, worked with Moor's wife, Winifred Christie, to operate the second invention, a piano with two keyboards, the lower keyboard of which has its raised white keys to allow chromatic glissando and a pedal intermediate coupling the two keyboards - not to mention an ingenious system which made it possible to imitate a harpsichord. Marie Tutundjian played with it on 03-11-1921 at the Palace of Montreux and at least once again on 16-11-1921 [La Musique dans le Canton de Vaud (1904-1938), p. 146. See pages 251, 252 on Marie Tutundjian/de Jarowslawska], but these trials , if they leave a trace in music history are not repeated [Encyclop√©die de la musique, 2e partie, vol. 3, p. 2080-2081]. Maurice Ravel said that the Em√°nuel Mo√≥r Pianoforte produced the sounds he had really intended in some of his works, if only it had been possible to write them for two hands playing on a standard piano.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954, Eric Blom ed. Anatoly Brandukov, dedicatee of Mo√≥r's Cello Sonata, No. 2 in G Major, Op. 55, introduced the composer to Pablo Casals. Casal's first meeting is recorded in nearly every biography about Casals. In his own words Casals said, ‚ÄúHis music was overwhelming‚Ä¶.and the more he played, the more convinced I became that he was a composer of the highest order. When he stopped, I said simply, ‚ÄòYou are a genius.‚Äô‚ÄùJoys and Sorrows; Reflections by Pablo Casals as Told to Albert E. Kahn, Pablo Casals, Simon and Schuster, New York (1973) , pp. 138 This meeting was the beginning of a long friendship between the two with Casals performing and premiering Mo√≥r's compositions, several of which were dedicated to Casals. For example, Casals gave four performances of the Cello Sonata No. 2 in G Major in December of 1905 alone following his initial meeting with the composer earlier in the year. Casals‚Äôs first noted performance of this sonata came during a Russian tour (pianist not noted) followed by two performances with Marie Panth√®s in Geneva and Lausanne and one performance in Paris with Alfred Cortot at the piano. Casals also championed other of Mo√≥r‚Äôs works, performing multiple sonatas, a concerto that Mo√≥r dedicated to him, a double cello concerto, and a triple concerto for piano trio with orchestra. Mo√≥r and Christie also collaborated on a book of technical exercises for the instrument.

The station opened in 1891 as a terminus, the line being extended to Welshpool the next year. For a number of years after the ending of regular V/Line passenger operations on the line east of Cranbourne in 1993, the station was the terminus of the former South Gippsland Tourist Railway, but its operations ceased in January 2016. The track south of Leongatha has been dismantled and turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail. The station precinct includes a well preserved red brick station building, goods shed, water tower and footbridge. The goods shed has since been demolished with a view of converting the unused railway reservation for a shopping plaza, which has not yet eventuated. The track east of Leongatha Station ended at the rear of a petrol station, approx 500 metres away. The home signal for trains approaching Leongatha from Koonwarra remained, but because there was no rail for any significant distance from the signal, it was decommissioned. From the end of the rails, the reservation is a crushed rock pathway mainly used by bicycles and pedestrians. The South Gippsland Shire Council had successfully attained a 18 year lease of the 35 km railway corridor from Leongatha to Nyora. Its intention for the corridor is to remove the railway tracks and replace it with a bicycle track aimed to attract a Melbourne based tourism market. Regardless of community representations to the Victorian state government seeking return of railway services, the council has, since January 2020 commenced works to remove the railway infrastructure from the railway reservation from Leongatha station to Nyora station. Current status The reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha is continuing to feature as a prominent issue for the region. The line was first closed along with numerous other regional Victorian railways by the Lonie Report in 1981. The Transport Users Group was successful campaigning to have passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on 9 December 1984. The line would again be closed first to Barry Beach and Yarram in 1992, and then to Leongatha in July 1993. The promise in 1999 to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services, by the Steve Bracks-led Victorian state Labor government, was abandoned in 2008 by his successor John Brumby. A community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group is continuing to work collaboratively with key stakeholders and governments to have rail services reinstated, and generally improve transport accessibility in the region. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transport and rail lobby group, established in April 2011, is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and other local governments. It has continued to campaign for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects documents released in June 2013 acknowledged that the return of rail as a major community priority where funding and support are sought from all forms of level government. In early 2014, a report into the extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee-Rup along the disused Leongatha line as a key planning priority. V/Line bus terminus Leongatha Railway Station is used as a terminus for the V/Line Road Coach service, and as a stop on the Coach route to Yarram. The railway station toilet facilities have recently become available to V/Line bus passengers. As of 2017, these toilet facilities have been closed. Location Leongatha Railway Station is located on Long street, Leongatha. Long Street is accessible from the Strzelecki Highway and Nerrena Road, just off the South Gippsland Highway. Trains from Leongatha Since the closure of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway, no train services operate from Leongatha Station.. V/Line coach services  To compensate for the government not re-opening the railway to Leongatha for passenger services, a new bus timetable provided for additional services from Spencer Street Station (now Southern Cross station) in Melbourne to Leongatha and Yarram. The current timetable provides for eight coach services daily, four of which continue through to the former railway terminus at Yarram. Weekend timetables provide for four services on each of Saturday and Sunday. The increased timetable had proven popular, with some services needing two coaches to cope with the traffic.

Myrtifolia means myrtle-like leaves. The fruit is a fleshy black berry achene slightly similar to a blackberry but toxic. Coriaria myrtifolia has the largest fruits in the genus Coriaria. It is especially dangerous for children, who may eat it if they confuse it with edible berries. Coriaria myrtifolia should be recognized as one of the most neurotoxic plants in the western Mediterranean area. Range Geographically, this species is confined to northern Mediterranean coastal Spain and Southern France (from the Gironde to the Alpes Maritimes), penetrating into Italy as far as part of the Apennines. The species reappears in the western Rif and Algeria, and in the Balearic islands it appears only in Ibiza. The oldest known mention of this plant, dating from 932, is in a place name and implies its presence in the County of Manresa, north-west of Barcelona.¬´ In comitatum Manresa, in terminio de Kastro Rosetorium... ¬ª, F. Udina Martorell, El Archivo condal de Barcelona en los siglos ix-x. Estudio cr√≠tico de sus fondos, Barcelona, 1951, p. 204, ¬ß 104. In all this range, this plant plays an important role in preventing soil erosion and serves as understory vegetation. It is extraordinarily abundant in the less dense woodlands of the Spanish provinces of Girona and Barcelona (eastern part) at altitudes of 200‚Äì600 m, reaching occasionally to 1,000 m. Name The Spanish name emborrachacabras (i.e. makes goats drunk) refers to the leaves' intoxicating effect on goats that eat them. The French name is Corroy√®re √† feuilles de myrte. The Occitan name (rodor) and Catalan name (roldor) derive from Latin Rhus tyrius (Rhus coriaria), referring to the leaves' use in the traditional tannery industry. Description A flowering plant (Castelltallat)The root nodules of this plant carry out symbiotic nitrogen fixation, Coriaria myrtifolia is one of the 13 Coriaria species known to bear actinorhizae. The redoul is a shrub with branches greyish square section. The leaves are sessile, mostly opposite but sometimes in groups of three or more, oblong, acuminate, with three ribs. The small greenish flowers, which appear from April to June in racemes, have five reddish highlights styles, five sepals and five petals, with ten stamens. The black fruits are formed of five fleshy carpels, each containing one seed. Toxicity The leaves and fruits of Coriaria myrtifolia contain coriamyrtin, a typical convulsant substance one member of picrotoxane sesquiterpenes, was first isolated in 1864. Toxic effects are characterized by digestive (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), neurological (obnubilation, convulsions and their complications), and respiratory disorders (polypnea, respiratory problems, apnea, short and superficial respiration) together with myositis of the pupils. Treatment of this poisoning is purely symptomatic. In the case of convulsions, rapid resuscitation in an intensive care unit is necessary. Coriamyrtin also has a pharmacological action. The honeydew from redoul is also toxic. Uses Traditionally, leaves of redoul were intensively collected for their tannin content, for tanning and dyeing purposes. During the medieval period, ecclesiastical institutions and the aristocracy clearly sought to establish some royalties on this resource, the samples are being especially on the distribution and sale of material first. These uses are due to the wealth of Coriaria spp tannin, particularly concentrated in the root and the bark of the stem, but also present in leaves, where they coexist with yellow dyes from the chemical group of flavonoids. These tannins are part of the group of hydrolyzable tannins, such as gall tannins. The chemical composition of redoul thus makes a tanning substance, capable of transforming recently flayed animal skins into leather, which is rot resistant, flexible and relatively impermeable, known as Basil leather.http://www.basane.fr/en/history2.php These properties allow for its widespread use in many industries. Moreover, the well-known chemical reaction of tannins with iron salts, producing black precipitates, is the basis for the manufacture of some inks used since the Middle Ages, and is also used to dye a variety of textiles black or gray. Until the mid-fourteenth century, the material was the subject of extensive trade between the north of Catalonia and Languedoc. The MƒÅori used species of Coriaria from New Zealand: they produced traditional tattoo inks from the fruit juice, made musical instruments from the hollow stems, and despite its extreme toxicity ate the fruit sparingly due to its sweet taste; using it to sweeten drinking water or jellies made from seaweed. Coriaria myrtifolia is also used as an ornamental plant.

Defining comorbidity: implications for understanding health and health services. Ann Fam Med. 2009 Jul-Aug;7(4):357-63. For example, a person could have diabetes and heart disease and high blood pressure. In the Medicare population, 65% of patients have two or more chronic illnesses. Some of the difficulties experienced by patients include: poor coordination of medical care, managing multiple medications, increases in their time spent managing illness, difficulty managing multiple illness management regimes,> and aggravation of one condition by symptoms or treatment of another. Concerning the qualitative experience of people with multiple chronic illness, Jowsey et al. (2009) writes: \\"Co-morbidity increased the amount of time participants spent managing their health and increased patients' dependency on others. Patients with co- morbid conditions encountered problems with the coordination between services and with polypharmacy. Patients prioritised the management of one condition over another; consequently, some health issues could be neglected or compromised. The three most common challenges to patients and carers in managing chronic illness (either caused or made worse by co-morbidity), relate to acting on risk factors, recognising signs and symptoms of illness and managing medications.\\" These kinds of challenges for people living with multiple chronic conditions have direct implications for health services and the way they support patient self-management. Multimorbidity is common in people who are elderly, malnourished, or poor. Multi-morbidity is common in people with dementia, with the average person with dementia living with five other chronic conditions. The Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health in Dementia (MATCH-D) was developed for this reason to support clinicians to manage medications for these people.

There were also bomb raids on June 1, 6, 7, 15, 26, July 10, 24, and August 14, the last day of the war. It is said that more than 10,000 civilians died in these bombings in Osaka, Japan. Background Osaka was the second largest city in Japan, with a population of 3,252,340 in 1940. Traditionally, it was the most important industrial concentration in the Far East. Osaka was one of the principal centers of heavy industry, noted for its shipbuilding, iron, steel, rolling stock works, as well as non-ferrous metals enterprises (notably copper and aluminum). In addition, it was noted for its production of aircraft propellers and propeller governors, munitions and ordnance, textiles, special steels, wires, electrical equipment, chemicals, instruments, and machines and machine tools, particularly anti-friction bearings. It was also a transportation hub and home to Japan's third largest port. Much work had been done to develop its naturally shallow harbor, and it was also the center of Japan's rail network. March firebombing raid The first air raid on Osaka lasted for about three and a half hours from 23:57 on March 13, 1945, to 03:25. A total of 274 B-29 heavy bombers attacked Osaka. The first wave of 43 bombers of the 314th Bombardment Wing arrived from Guam island. It was a low-level night raid from an altitude of about 2,000m aiming at the local civilian housings. The first bombers dropped incendiary bombs at targets in the Minato ward which started a firestorm. The second wave of 107 bombers of the 313th Bombardment wing arrived from Tinian and attacked the Naniwa ward. Finally, 124 bombers of the 73rd Bombardment Wing from Saipan arrived and attacked the Kita and Nishi wards. This bombing raid resulted in 3,987 dead and 678 missing and destroyed 8.1 square miles (21 km2) of the city for the loss of two aircraft. Results The bombing raid resulted in 3,987 dead and 678 missing and destroyed 8.1 square miles (21 km2) of the city for the loss of two aircraft, one by accident. 274 aircraft dropped a total of 1,733 tons of bombs on the urban area of Osaka. The destruction of Osaka was almost entirely concentrated in one area southwest of Osaka Castle. The U.S. suffered no crew casualties during the mission. The aircraft lost from the accident crashed and burned on take-off, but all crew members escaped. June and July air raids A B-29 over Osaka on 1 June 1945 On the first day of June 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed 3.15 square miles (8.2 km2) of buildings. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7 June; during this attack 2.21 square miles (5.7 km2) of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time in the month on 15 June when 444 B-29s destroyed 1.9 square miles (4.9 km2) of the city and another 0.59 square miles (1.5 km2) of nearby Amagasaki; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka. On 24 July, 625 B-29s were dispatched against seven targets near Nagoya and Osaka. On the night of 6/7 July the 315th Bombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. Last air raid - August 14, 1945 Kyobashi Station on June, 1946 (ten months after the raid) The eighth bomb raid was executed on August 14, 1945, the day before the end of the war. Approximately 150 B-29's raided Osaka. They dropped about 700 1-ton bombs, targeting the Japanese Army's factories in Eastern Osaka. Four units of 1-ton bombs were also dropped onto Kyobashi Station of the Japan National Railway nearby around 1pm, resulting in substantial damage to the civilian-filled station. This air raid was also called \\"Kyobashi Station Bomb Raid\\". There were two trains that had just arrived at the station when the bombs were dropped. The victims of the air raid in this station counted more than 210 dead civilians identified, more than 500 unidentified.

His greatest results have been winning three stages of the Tour de France, as well the overall classification of the Route du Sud in 2005. He also won the one-day race Paris‚ÄìCamembert in 2011. Career Born in Mantes- la-Jolie, Yvelines, Casar turned professional in 2000 after riding for Jean Floch-Mantes as an amateur. Casar's talent was revealed in Paris‚ÄìNice 2002, which he finished second at 23 years old. He finished 13th in the 2003 Giro d'Italia, in front of climber Marco Pantani. He had his biggest win in a stage of the 2003 Tour de Suisse. He then finished 16th in the 2004 Tour de France, and sixth in the 2006 Giro d'Italia, 25 minutes behind winner Ivan Basso. Casar also won the Route du Sud in 2005. On 27 July 2007, he won his first Tour de France stage, beating Laurent Lefevre, Axel Merckx and Michael Boogerd in a sprint after a collision with a dog earlier in the day. He then finished 14th overall in the 2008 Tour de France. In 2009, Casar finished second in the 16th stage of the 2009 Tour de France. Stage 16 was originally won by Mikel Astarloza. However, Astarloza was found after the Tour to have tested positive for EPO before the race had started. The organisers stripped him of the stage win and Casar became the official stage winner. Casar later finished 11th overall that year. In 2010, Casar won the stage 9 of the 2010 Tour de France, after being part of a long breakaway that went over numerous categorized climb, including the Col de la Madeleine. The breakaway was down to only four units in the descent of the col, and got caught in the final kilometer by Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador, who had escaped from the main group on the Madeleine. Casar won the uphill sprint to take the prestigious victory in one of the toughest stages of that year's Tour. In 2011, he won the Paris‚ÄìCamembert classic, again after being part of a long breakaway. He tried to escape on a slope near the end, but was caught by four riders. He nonetheless prevailed in the sprint against these four, taking the win on the roads he trained on in his youth. On 6 September 2013, Casar announced his retirement from cycling.

Yalden played mainly for Chertsey and Surrey though he was also a regular, sometimes as captain, in England XI teams, particularly in matches against Hampshire. His career began in the 1760s and he is known to have played until 1785. Cricket career Between 1772 and 1783, Yalden made 44 known appearances in matches now classified as first-class by ESPNcricinfo and CricketArchive.Note that surviving match records to 1825 are incomplete and any statistical compilation of a player's career in that period is based on known data. Match scorecards were not always created, or have been lost, and the matches themselves were not always recorded in the press or other media. Scorecard data was not comprehensive: e.g., bowling analyses lacked balls bowled and runs conceded; bowlers were not credited with wickets when the batsman was caught or stumped; in many matches, the means of dismissal were omitted. This is the total found in Scores & Biographies and cited by ESPNcricinfo; it is also the total that can be counted in CricketArchive's list of his matches but, on its profile page, CricketArchive says he made 45 appearances which is incorrect.Haygarth, pp. 4‚Äì60. CricketArchive lists seven \\"miscellaneous\\" matches in which Yalden is recorded, the last two of these in 1784 and 1785. Fielding records are incomplete during Yalden's career but he is credited with 64 catches and one stumping in his first-class record. Stumpings are difficult to find in the eighteenth century sources because they were often recorded as run outs, though there is one scorecard in which a dismissal is recorded as \\"put out behind The Yold\\": i.e., st Yalden. Yalden's single first-class stumping was recorded in a Surrey v Hampshire match at Laleham Burway in October 1778, the victim being Henry Bonham. According to Scores & Biographies, this was the second-ever record of a stumping following one in 1744, though stumpings did occur but \\"it was not written down as such in the score\\".Haygarth, p. 38. Yalden's best performance with the bat was probably in September 1773 when he played for a Surrey XI versus a Hampshire XI at Broadhalfpenny Down. He scored 88 out of 225 and enabled Surrey to win the game by an innings and 60 runs.Haygarth, p. 60. This innings was the \\"world record\\" for the highest individual score in first-class matches since the statistical record began in 1772. The previous highest was 78 by John Small in the first match of the 1772 season. Yalden's score was beaten by Joseph Miller, who made 95 at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1774. According to Arthur Haygarth, Yalden gave up cricket for one season because he thought his eyesight was failing, but the Earl of Tankerville said to him: \\"Try again, Yalden\\". So he resumed his career with continued success. The story may be apocryphal as Yalden certainly played continuously from 1772, though the incident could have occurred before then. Haygarth also reports that once, when fielding, Yalden had to jump over a fence and ended up on his back, but still caught the ball. The Cricketers of My Time In The Cricketers of My Time, Yalden was briefly mentioned in somewhat unfavourable terms by John Nyren whose comments may have had some substance but, on the other hand, it is difficult to believe that the Hambledon players were all as perfect as Nyren portrayed them to be.Nyren, p. 75. The Hampshire teams promoted by the Hambledon Club were very competitive and so, evidently, were their opponents, among whom Yalden was a prominent member, sometimes as captain. Nyren describes Yalden as \\"a thin, dark-looking man\\" and as \\"not a fine, but a very useful and steady batter\\". Nyren revered Hambledon's Tom Sueter and Yalden was Sueter's rival as both a wicketkeeper and a batsman, although they played together for Hampshire in 1772. They are the first two players in cricket history to be recognised as \\"wicketkeeper/batsmen\\", since they were specialist keepers who nevertheless justified selection for their batting alone. Nyren chose to denigrate Yalden in comparison with his hero Sueter saying that: \\"I must place Sueter above Yalden\\" (i.e., as a wicketkeeper) and that Yalden \\"was in other respects an inferior man to Sueter\\". Nyren says that Yalden's \\"word was not always to be depended on when he had put a man out\\" as \\"he would now and then shuffle (sic) and \\"resort to trick\\". He goes on to assert that Sueter and the other Hambledon players would not do such things because of \\"estimation\\", \\"honour\\", \\"trust\\" and never questioning the decision of the umpire. Nyren's comments are seriously biased but some balance is provided by the editor's introduction to the modern version of the book when he states that \\"Yalden ‚Äì the England wicketkeeper and captain, no less ‚Äì is dismissed in a few words\\" while several other notable players are not mentioned at all.Nyren, p. 36 (editor's comments). Elsewhere the editor discusses Nyren's undoubted plagiarism of an earlier work by William Lambert and it is widely agreed that Nyren's account of Hambledon's players is hagiographic, often at the expense of their opponents, and Yalden is one player who was not given a fair hearing in this book.Nyren, p. 31 (editor's comments). Outside cricket Yalden was a licensed victualler in Chertsey and, like Lumpy Stevens, was a long-time member of the local club. He managed the Laleham Burway ground situated close to the town, supplying refreshments during the great matches.

Luo's poetry was widely read and cherished, but he was unsuccessful in life; having failed the imperial examination 10 times, he was penniless until the warlord and Wuyue founder Qian Liu gave him official posts in his hometown Hang Prefecture. Luo was said to be very ugly and arrogant. Life Luo was born in Fuyang, Zhejiang. At the age of 20, he took his first Imperial examination. He failed the exam ten times. As a result, he gave himself the pseudonym \\"Yin\\" (lit. \\"dormant\\"). He was said to be of ugly countenance, and that he thought highly of himself and looked down on others. A famous anecdote demonstrates his ugliness: grand councilor Zheng Tian had a young daughter who enjoyed literature, and Luo Yin's poems which she frequently read out loud were her favorite readings. Zheng Tian became worried about her infatuation. One day, he invited Luo to his residence, and his daughter took a peek at the guest from behind the curtains. From that day on she never read his poems again. In 870, he was given a post in Hunan. However, he was unable to take advantage of the post, and returned to Zhejiang in 887. Penniless and frustrated, he later became an assistant to Qian Liu, but never shed his arrogant ways. He died at the age of 77.

All of them are likely of modern origin, with some of them possibly dating to the 19th century \\"Viking revival\\" or being produced by 19th-century Scandinavian settlers. The oldest find is the \\"Heavener Runestone,\\" first documented in 1923. It is most likely a 19th-century artifact made by a Scandinavian immigrant (possibly a Swede working at the local train depot). Two other \\"Heavener Runestones\\" are most likely not runic at all but exhibit incisions of Native American origin. Three other runestones, found in Poteau, Shawnee and Pawnee, are of modern date. Heavener Runestone The Heavener Runestone is located in Heavener Runestone Park in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, near Heavener, Oklahoma. The runes on the stone are . Most of these characters belong to the Elder Futhark, but the final \\"L\\" is reversed compared with the last \\"A\\", and the second character is a short-twig \\"A\\" from the Younger Futhark. The transcription is then gaomedal, but is generally thought that the intention is that the second character should be an elder futhark \\"N\\" (also reversed). The inscription then reads gnomedal (either \\"gnome valley\\", or a personal name \\"G. Nomedal\\"). Media presented at the Visitor's Center translate the as an \\"L,\\" and state that the inscription was probably a claim marker meaning \\"valley belonging to Glome,\\" or \\"Glome's Valley.\\" Archaeologist Ken Feder notes that unlike the situation in eastern Canada where evidence has been found that proves a Norse presence, nothing similar has been found anywhere near Heavener or even in the American Midwest. He suggests that \\"It is unlikely that the Norse would get significantly more fastidious about leaving any evidence behind of their presence in Oklahoma.\\"Kenneth L. Feder, Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum, page 137 (Greenwood, 2010). Archaeologist Lyle Tompsen in a 2007 Masters Thesis for the University of Leicester (published in ESOP 29 2011:5-43) examined the runestone and noted: # There is no cultural evidence of Vikings in or near the region. # No Old Norse approach to translation fits this stone. # The stone's most likely translation is 'Gnome Dale' (Valley of the Gnomes). # Scandinavian presence in the nearby town of Heavener is early and the likeliest source of the carving of the stone. # Other purported rune stones in the region are modern creations, or misinterpreted Native American rock art. \\"Barring any new evidence, the stone is best considered a modern creation.\\" Henrik Williams, professor in Nordic languages at University of Uppsala, visited Oklahoma in 2015 as part of a tour sponsored by the American Association for Runic Studies in collaboration with Uppsala University and the American Friends of Uppsala University. In a speech to the Poteau Chamber of Commerce he said that the Heavener stone \\"Is probably in the top 20 I‚Äôve seen in the world, just for the sheer size and impressive nature of it.‚Äù He said that it was probably 19th century with a 20% probability of it being 10th or 11th century. ‚ÄúAll words have endings, back 1,000 and 500 years ago, and that is one thing we find disturbing,‚Äù Williams said of the nonconforming ending on the Heavener Runestone. ‚ÄúNone of the American inscriptions ever found have any kind of layout or ornamentation. That‚Äôs another thing that doesn‚Äôt really fit the pattern.‚Äù He also noted that \\"There are no Vikings or earlier inscriptions on Iceland or Greenland, so it‚Äôs a big jump from Sweden to Heavener.\\" In 1991, Carl Albert State College in nearby Poteau changed its mascot to a Viking in the stone's honor. Poteau Stone The Poteau stone was found by schoolboys in 1967 near Poteau in Le Flore County, Oklahoma. Tompsen also examined this stone, and writes that it is carved into sandstone and is 15 inches long and shows little weathering. They read and Thompsen writes \\"This stone consists of a mixture of letters and alphabets from different times.\\" He transcribes these as GLOIEA(?)(?). Of the eight letters, five are Elder Futhark, one Younger Futhark. The other two he calls \\"spurious\\". He writes: \\" By excluding the last two letters as spurious, five are on the Heavener stone itself. The only one left is a straight line. To the author‚Äôs eyes, the Poteau Stone is a copy of the Heavener stone, with the addition of three spurious runic symbols as script-inflation.\\" Swedish Professor Henrik Williams believes that the inscription is modern, with the stone and toolmarks not as weathered as would be expected if it were from the Viking period. Shawnee and Pawnee Stones the Shawnee runestone The Shawnee stone was found in 1969 by three children in Shawnee, Oklahoma, one mile from the North Canadian River, which is a tributary of the Arkansas River. Professor Don G Wyckoff, an archaeologist at the University of Oklahoma, examined the Shawnee stone and noted that it is a soft red Permian sandstone, writing that \\"the inscription is... remarkably fresh and certainly not as worn or weathered as the stone's natural surface. The Survey staff has viewed other exposures of this Permian sandstone which have carved dates as late as 1957 that are more worn and weathered...\\"Wyckoff, Don G, \\"No Stones Unturned:Differing Views of Oklahoma's Runestones\\" in Popular Archaeology, 2:16-31, no 12, 1973, reprinted in Ancient Man: A Handbook of Puzzling Artifacts, compiled by William R.

It is widely regarded as one of the greatest Irish-language novels of the 20th century. An English translation by Patrick C. Power appeared in 1973. Stan Gebler Davies wrote: \\"The Poor Mouth is wildly funny, but there is at the same time always a sense of black evil. Only O'Brien's genius, of all the writers I can think of, was capable of that mixture of qualities.\\"Flann O'Brien (1941/1974), The Poor Mouth, trans., Patrick C. Power, illus., Ralph Steadman, New York: Viking, back of dust cover, quoting Stan Gebler Davies, Evening Standard. Background The book is a kindly parody of the genre of Gaeltacht autobiographies, such as Tom√°s √ì Criomhthain's autobiography (The Islandman), or Peig Sayers' autobiography Peig, which recounts her life, especially the latter half, as a series of misfortunes in which much of her family die by disease, drowning or other mishap. Books of this genre were part of the Irish language syllabus in the Irish school system and so were mandatory reading for generations of children from independence in 1921. O'Nolan was in fact a great admirer of An t-Oile√°nach, which is widely regarded as being the greatest work of the genre, but critic Declan Kiberd has noted how O'Nolan's admiration for a writer tended to express itself as parody of the writer's work. The Irish expression \\"to put on the poor mouth\\" () is mildly pejorative and refers to the practice, often associated with peasant farmers, of exaggerating the direness of one's situation, particularly financially, to evoke sympathy, charity and perhaps the forbearance of creditors and landlords or generosity of customers. The title may also be a parody of that of the Irish language reader An Saol M√≥r (The Great Life)Mac S√≠thigh, T., An Saol M√≥r: L√°imhleabhar Ghn√°theolais ar Shaol an Lae Inniu: M.H. Mac an Ghoill agus a Mhac Teo. (in Irish, b√©al and saol are near-rhymes). The title is, perhaps, more likely to be a parody on 'An B√©al Beo' (The Living Tongue) by Tomas √ì M√°ille, published by An G√∫m 1936. One of the recurring figures of speech in the book is the line from √ì Criomhthain's , , \\"...for our likes will not be (seen) again\\"; variations of it appear throughout . All of O'Nolan's other novels were published under the pseudonym Flann O'Brien; it is the only one for which he used the \\"Myles na gCopaleen\\" pseudonym that he was then using for his celebrated Irish Times column Cruiskeen Lawn. (Subsequently O'Nolan altered the newspaper byline slightly to the more anglicised \\"Myles na Gopaleen\\".) Neither is a real Irish surname, however. Both derive from a character named Myles-na-Coppaleen in Dion Boucicault's 1860 play The Colleen Bawn, which, in turn, comes from the Irish , \\"of the little horses\\". As if to confuse matters, the English translation of is published as the work of \\"Flann O'Brien\\".  Plot  is set in , (Corkadoragha, Corkadorkey), a remote region of Ireland where it never stops raining and everyone lives in desperate poverty (and always will) while talking in \\"the learned smooth Gaelic\\". It is a memoir of one B√≥nap√°rt √ì C√∫nasa (Bonaparte O'Coonassa), a resident of this region, beginning at his very birth. At one point the area is visited by hordes of Dublin (Irish language lovers), who explain that not only should one always speak Irish, but also every sentence one utters should be about the language question. However, they eventually abandon the area because the poverty is too poor, the authenticity too authentic and the Gaelicism too Gaelic. The narrator, after a series of bloodcurdling adventures, is eventually sent to prison on a false murder charge, and there, \\"safe in jail and free from the miseries of life\\", has the chance to write this most affecting memoir of our times. Play An adaptation of by Sean A O'Briain was performed for the first time in the Damer Hall, Dublin on 31 January 1967 by An Cumann Gaelach from University College Dublin.http://www.irishplayography.com/play.aspx?playid=32975 It was also part of The University Drama Festival in Galway in February 1967. On Wednesday, 26 July 1967 the play opened in The Peacock Theatre, Dublin and was the very first production in the theatre.https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/archives/production_detail/2060 It ran for only three days and closed abruptly.

With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main bearings, big end bearings and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets. Sufficient oil pressure ensures that the metal of the rotating shaft (journal) and the bearing shell can never touch, and wear is therefore confined to initial start-up and shutdown. The oil pressure, combined with the rotation of the shaft, also hydrodynamically centers the journal in its shell and cools the bearings. Such a bearing is known as a fluid bearing. Oil pressure is higher when the engine is cold due to the increased viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. Oil pressure is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive oil pressure may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of oil. Low oil pressure indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump. Some vehicle engines have an oil pressure switch that switches a warning light on at low oil pressure. Some vehicles have an oil pressure gauge in the dashboard or instrument cluster. Oil pressure is created by a fluid flow restriction in the outlet line of the pump, not by the pump itself. Examples of such restrictions include big end and main bearings, as well as camshaft and rocker gear if fitted.

Along with V√≠ctor Manuel, Amelia Pel√°ez, Fidelio Ponce, Antonio Gattorno, and other masters of this period, he was involved in one of the most fertile moments in Cuban culture. He is considered by critics to be one of the best, and most original, Cuban artists of the 20th century. Enr√≠quez strived to develop a genuinely Cuban style that, while fueled by surrealism and modernism, took inspiration from Cuba's landscapes, culture, social problems and way of living. He was also considered a rebel, and was often criticized for the allegedly explicit nature of his nudes, and for his bohemian lifestyle. Early years Born in Zulueta, in the former Cuban province of Las Villas, on August 3, 1900 to a wealthy Cuban family, Carlos Enr√≠quez received little academic training, so his art would be considered to be largely self-taught. At a young age he transferred to Havana to complete his bachelor studies, and in 1920 his parents sent him to Philadelphia, where he studied Commerce until 1924. At his insistence, he was permitted to study Painting at the Pennsylvania Academy, where he took a short summer course. Due to differences with his professors he never finished the course, which was the only formal art education he ever received. He returned home the following year, with fellow painter Alice Neel whom he married that year. Soon after his return, he started painting professionally, while working as an accountant at the Lonja del Comercio (Havana's Stock Exchange). In 1925 he participated in his first exposition, and in 1927 two of his nudes were removed from the Exhibition of New Arts in Havana after being deemed \\"exaggeratedly realistic\\". However, 1927 marks the year when the Cuban Vanguardia movement made its first steps, mainly thanks to this exhibition, and many of the artists that participated in it went on to become the leading lights of the movement. The episode convinced Enr√≠quez to return to the United States. After breaking up with Alice Neel, he returned to Cuba in 1930 with their daughter Isabetta. That same year, another of his exhibitions was aborted due to the allegedly explicit content of his paintings. He again left Cuba, this time for Europe, mainly Spain and France, where he continued his painting career and came in contact with Impressionism and surrealism, currents that would radically influence his work. Some of his best works were produced in this period, including Bacteriological Spring and Virgen del Cobre (which is the patron saint of Cuba). Abduction of the Mulatto Women; 1938, Carlos Enriquez. Enriquez returned to Cuba in 1934, and began developing a new pictorial style, which would become his trademark. He named it romancero guajiro (countryman's romance), a modernist approach to the stories and colors of the Cuban countryside. As with the other vanguardia artists, re-encountering his native land provided the catalyst for his mature style and his commitment to the expression of Cuban social realities and popular myths. One of his preoccupations as an artist concerned the expression of an authentic Cuban- Caribbean culture, which he believed was only to be found in the countryside, in its Creole people, myths, and legends.Martinez, Juan A.;Cuban Art & National Identity: The Vanguardia Painters, 1927-1950; University Press of Florida, 1994; Enr√≠quez's romancero guajiro was strongly influenced by some of the core ideas of modernist primitivism. His primitivism, however differs from that of Antonio Gattorno and Eduardo Abela in that it does not represent the guajiros as simple, calm, and noble, but rather as raw, violent, and restless. His painting Rey de los Campos de Cuba (King of the Cuban Fields) received first prize in 1935's National Exposition of Painters and Sculptors. Rise to fame and death In 1939 Enriquez bought a small bungalow, which he christened El Hur√≥n Az√∫l (the Blue Ferret), in the Arroyo Naranjo district on the outskirts of Havana. This remained his home for the rest of his life. Here he painted El Rapto de las Mulatas (The kidnapping of the Mulatto Women), one of his most famous works, featured on a 1964 Cuban stamp. A transposition of the Rape of the Sabine Women to the Cuban fields, it is said that Enr√≠quez had a horse brought to his workshop, tied Sara Chem√©ndez (his female model at the time) to the horse and had the animal lashed, in order to have a more realistic scene for the painting. The same year, he was again awarded a prize in the National Exhibition (for El Rapto de las Mulatas), and published his first novel, Til√≠n Garc√≠a. In the 1940s he wrote two more novels (La Vuelta de Chencho and La Feria de Guaicanama, which were published posthumously in 1960), illustrated books, held conferences and exhibitions in several countries, wrote articles for various magazines, and continued to paint. He also received another prize in 1946's National Exhibition for his painting La Arlequina. His life was marked by alcoholism. During the 1950s his health weakened, and he suffered several problems with broken bones, allegedly caused by his unregulated way of living. He is said to have had severe economical problems, for the same reason. He died on May 2, 1957, while painting in his study. That same day, a personal exposition was to be inaugurated (it was delayed a month after news of his death). His house in Havana is now a small museum with about 140 paintings by Enr√≠quez, and a number of sketches and writings. The house also acts as the meeting place for a small organization of young Cuban artists, named Hur√≥n Az√∫l. Style Enr√≠quez' signature visual language was mainly composed by fluid lines, overlapping color forms, transparencies and dynamic figure compositions. His works usually aimed at depicting the Cuban countryside's history, myths and folklore. Poor peasants, bandits, sensual women, restless horses, and landscapes of palm trees and rolling hills were his common subjects. One of the foremost examples of Enr√≠quez's romancero guajiro and of his painting in general is El Rapto de las mulatas (1938), in which Enr√≠quez includes some of the above named elements of his iconography: aggressive rural men, sensual mulatto women, restless horses, and windswept landscape of rolling hills. Its heated emotional subject of abduction and potential rape is not only depicted, but forcefully expressed through a personal visual language of pulsating and diaphanous color- forms.Mart√≠nez, Juan. Cuban Art and National Identity. Florida: University Press Florida, 1994: 120 Enr√≠quez's paintings are about ecstasy when they are not about violence, for in both themes he identified one of the fundamental characteristics of his latitudes-the strident, orgasmic, experience of finiteness.Cruz-Taura, Graciella, Fuentes-Perez, Ileana, and Pau-Llosa, Ricardo. Outside Cuba. New Jersey: Office of Hispanic Arts Mason Gross School of the Arts, 1988: 44. He also painted portraits and self-portraits, a large number of nudes, and a handful of still lifes. He described his work in the following manner: > \\"My work is in a constant state of evolution towards the interpretation of > images produced between vigilance and sleep, Nevertheless, I am not a > surrealist. Currently, I am interested in interpreting the sensibility of a > Cuban, American or continental atmosphere but removed from the methods of > the European schools. To do otherwise would be like trying to resolve that > which is ours with foreign formulas, for oriental art is as distant from my > sensibility (though it may move me) as is the art of Picasso\\". Enr√≠quez was also an accomplished writer and illustrator. He published 3 books and a number of essays and articles. He also provided the illustration artwork for books by Nicol√°s Guill√©n and Alejo Carpentier, two famous Cuban writers that were friends of the painter and regularly visited his workshop. Collections Enr√≠quez' art started having wide recognition during his lifetime, currently his work is permanently displayed in the following museums and collections around the world: * National Museum of Havana (or Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes). *Museum of Modern Art, New York. * El Hur√≥n Az√∫l, Havana. * Cuban Foundation Museum, Daytona Beach. * Cuban Museum of Art and Culture, Miami.

It was the mortuary deified portrayal of Kertarajasa. Originally located at Candi Simping, Blitar. (National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta) Raden Wijaya or Raden Vijaya (also known as Nararya Sangramawijaya, regnal name Kertarajasa Jayawardhana) (reigned 1293‚Äì1309) was a Javanese King, the founder and the first monarch of the Majapahit Empire.Slamet Muljana, 2005, Runtuhnya Kerajaan Hindu-Jawa dan Timbulnya Negara-negara Islam di Nusantara, Yogyakarta: LKiS, . The history of his founding of Majapahit was written in several records, including Pararaton and Negarakertagama. His rule was marked by the victory against the army and the navy of Kublai Khan's Yuan dynasty. Ancestry There are several versions of his ancestry. According to Pararaton, Raden Wijaya was the son of Mahisa Campaka, prince of Singhasari. According to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara, Raden Wijaya was the son of Rakeyan Jayadarma (son of Sunda-Galuh King Prabu Guru Darmasiksa) and Dyah Lembu Tal (daughter of Mahisa Campaka from Singhasari). Rakeyan Jayadarma was poisoned and after her husband's death, Dyah Lembu Tal returned from Sunda-Galuh Kingdom to Singhasari with Raden Wijaya. This story is similar to that of Babad Tanah Jawi which mentioned the founder of Majapahit was Jaka Sesuruh, a son from the king of Pajajaran's which is located in Sunda Kingdom. Jaka Sesuruh ran to the east because of a rivalry with his step brother Siyung Wanara. Alternatively with Nagarakretagama, Dyah Lembu Tal, also known as Dyah Singhamurti, was a man and the great-grandson of Ken Arok, king of Singhasari (1222‚Äì1227) and Ken Dedes, by their son Mahisa Wonga Teleng, and his son Mahisa Campaka (Nara Singhamurti). Because Nagarakretagama was written in 1365, 56 years since the Raden Wijaya's death, popular opinion supports it. Prior to the founding of Majapahit In 1289, Kublai Khan sent a demand for tribute to the Kingdom of Singhasari, although the demand was refused by Kertanagara and the messenger was humiliated. Shortly after, there was a rebellion against Singhasari in the duchy of Gelang-Gelang (modern-day Kediri) led by Jayakatwang. Kertanagara was killed in the attempt to put down the rebellion in 1292, and Raden Wijaya fled to Sumenep, Madura, along with the governor of that region, Aria Wiraraja. There, Raden Wijaya made a plan to establish a new kingdom. Wijaya promised that he would divide Java with Aria Wiraraja if Aria Wiraraja could help him overthrow Jayakatwang's Kediri kingdom. Wiraraja's son Ranggalawe served as one of Wijaya's senapati (warlord) but in later days he would rebel against the new king. Other famous officers were Lembu Sora and Nambi, both also rebelled against Wijaya respectively after the founding of Majapahit kingdom. Foundation of the Majapahit kingdom In November 1292, a Mongol force landed in Tuban, East Java, with the aim of revenge for Kertanagara's humiliation of the Mongol messenger. However, Kertanegara was already dead. Raden Wijaya initially made an alliance with the Mongols with the aim of attacking Singhasari, which by this time had fallen under the power of Jayakatwang. Jayakatwang was defeated and destroyed in 1293, at which point Raden Wijaya attacked the Mongol force. The Mongols, already weakened by tropical diseases, the climate, and imperial overreach, were forced to flee Java.\\"Beginning of the Mongol Collapse,\\" Columbia University, Asian Topics Online Raden Vijaya then established the Majapahit kingdom, taking the title Kritarajasa Jayavardhana. Consorts According to George Coedes, prior to the fall of Singhasari, Wijaya was married to Gayatri Rajapatni, the daughter of Kertanegara. However, during the formation of the new kingdom Majapahit, he married the four daughters of Kertanegara, and the eldest, Queen Paramesvari Tribhuvana, bore him a son. This son, Kala Gemet, was crowned Prince of Kediri in 1295. Raden Wijaya took the rest of Kertanegara's daughters in the hand of marriage; Prajnaparamitha, Narendra Duhita, and Gayatri Rajapatni the youngest. The reasons of Raden Wijaya's practice of siblings polygamy was to ensure his claim of legitimacy, also to prevent the contest for Kertanegara's Singhasari legacy. Raden Wijaya also took Indreswari (also known as Dara Petak), supposedly a princess of Malayu Dharmasraya Kingdom brought by Kebo Anabrang to Majapahit court from Sumatra through Kertanegara's Pamalayu expedition. Pararaton mentioned that Kala Gemet was born by Dara Petak, the Dharmasraya princess, while Nagarakretagama mentioned that he was born by Indreswari, leading to assumption that Indreswari was another name of Dara Petak. King Kertarajasa Jayawardhana has five wives, however in his posthumous portrayal as the god Harihara in Simping temple, his image was flanked by two female figures, suggested that he has two pramesvari (queen consort), one is Gayatri, the other is Tribhuwana or probably Dara Petak. Rule of Majapahit Raden Wijaya was known as a firm and capable ruler. Aria Wiraraja who had been so useful during the period of the establishment of the kingdom, was given Madura, which was granted a special status. He was also given an autonomous region around Lumajang and the Blambangan Peninsula, and his son, Nambi, was appointed Prime Minister. Heir From Indreswari, King Vijaya has a son Jayanegara, while from Gayatri Rajapatni he has two daughters, Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi and Rajadewi. Other wives seems to be childless, including his first wife Tribhuwana. After his death, King Kertarajasa Jayavardhana was succeeded by his son, Jayanegara.

He served as Member of Parliament for the Northwich constituency in Cheshire from 1945 to February 1974, and was Under-Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations from 1951 to 1954. Early life John Galway Foster was born 21 February 1903 to Hubert John Foster and Mary Agatha Foster (n√©e Tobin); he was their only child, but he had three half-siblings from his mother's previous marriage. His father was a British Army officer who served as Chief of the Australian General Staff from 1916 to 1917 during the First World War. Miriam Rothschild, who knew John well for many years, writes that he had a \\"lonely, confused and homeless childhood.\\" Rather than care for or relate to their son, his parents \\"abandoned [him] to the care of a governess, first in France and then at school in Germany.\\" Apparently, the governess was harsh, strict, and unloving. John Foster was a scholar of Eton College and achieved a first in modern history at New College, Oxford in 1924. He was elected a Fellow of All Souls the same year. He then entered the study of law and was called to the Bar by Inner Temple in 1927. Career He was appointed Recorder of Dudley (1936‚Äì38) and Recorder of Oxford (1938‚Äì51 & 1956‚Äì64). He lectured on private International Law at Oxford (1934‚Äì39) and The Hague. In 1939, he was in the United States and volunteered his services to the British Embassy. He was immediately appointed First Secretary and legal advisor. During this period, the United States was still a non-belligerent, and President Roosevelt faced many difficult problems related to the international law of neutrality. Foster played a significant behind-the-scenes role working on neutrality issues related to the Destroyer-for-Bases deal in 1940 and the Lend Lease Act in 1941. Miriam Rothschild writes that, \\"John had dealt with the trauma and wounds of his unhappy childhood by totally eliminating the past ‚Äî his father‚Äôs death [in 1919], his mother‚Äôs desertion and his homelessness ‚Äî and any possible emotive perturbations in the present.\\" He had \\"a unique gift of augmenting and gilding the actual moment.\\" Isaiah Berlin and Rothschild independently described Foster \\"as the greatest life enhancer we had ever met.\\" Foster got on well with the Americans. Isaiah Berlin, who was in Washington, DC in 1940, said that Foster was \\"very, very popular and never had less than two or three hundred friends.\\" The United States awarded him the Legion of Merit during his service with the British Embassy. By 1944, he had established himself as a capable attorney with a broad and deep understanding of the international law. That year, he was appointed chief of the legal section in General Dwight Eisenhower's, Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). In order to facilitate his relationships with the military forces, he was given the rank of brigadier. Foster later quipped: \\"One must start somewhere.\\" In addition to the American Legion of Merit, he was awarded the Legion of Honour and the Croix de guerre (with palms) from France. After the war, he participated in the Nuremberg trials. One of Brigadier Foster's most admirable actions involved the liberation of the Nazi death camps. Initially, well-meaning Allied forces simply liberated the camps and moved on to their next objective. As a result, many of the weak and starving prisoners simply died. When Foster learned of this problem, he had several direct meetings with Winston Churchill with the result that an effective procedure was put in place to provide the prisoners with needed care and protection. In 1945, Northwich in Cheshire elected him a Conservative member of Parliament, and he served Northwich until 1974. From 1951‚Äì54, he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Commonwealth Relations. He took silk in 1950. Foster devoted most of his post-war career to the practice of law and to the vigorous advocacy of human rights. He especially worked as an advocate for victims of persecution. Miriam Rothschild describes in some detail his post-war efforts to assist victims of the Holocaust. In 1986 the John Galway Foster Human Rights Trust was established; in 2006 the name of the trust was expanded to The Miriam Rothschild & John Foster Human Rights Trust. This funds an annual lecture on human rights. Later life Foster was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1964, and died in London 1 February 1982. His obituary described him as \\"a genius Benthamite Utilitarian who believed in the maximization of human pleasure.\\" He never married, although he enjoyed a 30-year relationship with the art historian Princess Lulie Abul-Huda Fevzi Osmanoglu.http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/682/17/Princess-Lulie-Abul-Huda- Fevzi-Osmanoglu------------.aspx His executor destroyed the bulk of his papers dealing with his public life.

It was founded as an all-male school in 1963 by Fr. William P. Mc Grath of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate at the request of the Archdiocese of Manila under Archbishop Michael J. O'Doherty in 1946. It has more than 3,000 students from Nursery to Fourth Year High School. NDGM has been a member of the Notre Dame Educational Association, a group of Notre Dame Schools in the Philippines under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary. History In 1946, the missionary Oblate of Mary Immaculate (OMI) began establishing the parish of Grace Park in Caloocan City upon the suggestion of Michael O‚Äô Doherty, the Archbishop of Manila. The Grade School Department was opened in 1963 with one building in the original 5.6 hectare campus before the neighboring Our Lady of Grace Academy of Caloocan City (now St. Mary's Academy of Caloocan City), a former all-girls school, administered by the RVM sisters, acquired a two-and-a-half hectare property bought from the Archdiocese of Manila. Father McGrath of Notre Dame of Greater Manila (NDGM) opened the Elementary Department with only 266 students from Kindergarten to Grade Five. Two years later, the High School Department was opened. As years passed, student population steadily increased. The first High School seniors graduated in 1969. By 1975, NDGM opened its doors to the indigent but deserving students and offered them five years of night high school. NDGM opened its doors for them with the same academic, expertise, and facilities. In 1980, the first batch of night school graduates received their high school diplomas together with their fellow day school graduates. Two years after, the Grant-in-Aid Program (GIAP), offering a graduated tuition fee discount, replaced the night high school program. In 1983, the High School Department set its sights on accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). On October 2, 1985, the High School Department was officially granted accreditation status by PAASCU, which is an accrediting body composed of different private educational institutions that stamp other private schools with a quality standard attained with regard to their programs. The Grade School Department prepared for the Formal Visit of the PAASCU Team. From January 25 to 27 in 1988, it was noted that the Grade School Department manifested wholesome community relationship, which facilitated an accreditation status for three years. After a year, the construction of the school chapel, new Science Laboratory, Campus Ministry office, Speech Laboratory, Electronic Data Processing of school operations, and relocation of the canteen was undertaken. The Community Extension Services Program (CESP) was launched on September 2, 1989. It started with activities such as the Grade School's Bagong Barrio Outreach Program, Saint Eugene de Mazenod Street Children Apostolate (BEMSCA) and ‚ÄúDay with the Urban Poor of Stotsenberg, Caloocan City\\". In 1990, The CESP soon included free medical-dental health care for the depressed communities of Grace Park Parish, donations to victims of typhoons, floods and Mt. Pinatubo's eruption and a Bahay-Lingap Drop-In- Center for Street Children. Notre Dame of Greater Manila offered courses in Electronics, Computer Secretarial and Automotive Mechanic, through its De Mazenod Skills Training Center (DMSTC). On 21st-20th February 1991, the Re- Survey Visit was conducted and a unanimous recommendation of re-accreditation status for three years was granted to the High School. On April 10, 1992, the Grade School was awarded a five-year PAASCU re-accreditation status. On July 31, 1998, the re-survey was conducted on the Grade School Department and PAASCU granted another five-year of re-accreditation. The High School Department was re-accredited for five years on May 31, 2001. On November 21, 2003, PAASCU granted the Grade School for another five years of re- accreditation. NDGM has 10 buildings: Grade School Main Building, Grade School Annex, High School Main Building, High School Science and Technology Building, DMSTC Building for vocational students, Gymnasium, High School Canteen, Kinder School Building, the air-conditioned School Chapel, and the Campus General Services Office. A continuous education process through seminars, recollections, retreats and the like is undertaken for a deeper understanding of the Vision-Mission. Serving as a guide, the Primer is envisioned to aid the community in refreshing the true Notre Dame spirit in its basic programs and activities, its staff and graduates.

The cities include Livermore, Dublin, Pleasanton and San Ramon. The station operates channels 28, 29 and 30 on the Comcast Cable TV system. It can also be seen throughout the San Francisco Bay Area on AT&T; U-verse VDSL service. It cablecasts to 68,000 households representing a population of nearly 200,000 people. Until mid-2007, TV30 was one of the few community cable stations with a live daily newscast. The Pleasanton-based station has endured management and budget controversies.  History  Tri- Valley Community Television started in 1976, founded by Darla Stevens, Charlotte Severin, Marshall Kamena and Lee Horner. Known then as CTV 30 (Community Television channel 30), the station expanded from having only a few hours each day on the air, to growing to 30 programs over three channels decades later. By the 1980s, the station moved from covering local events and happenings, and began producing studio shows with the help of the local cable company. Darla Stevens was Executive Director of the 501(c)3 California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation known as Tri-Valley Community Television until her retirement in November 2003. At that point, then Operations Manager Sheila Tole replaced Stevens as interim Executive Director. In March 2004, Bruce Goddard was hired for the position of Executive Director and Tole departed. Goddard instituted many changes in concert with city staff and the board. However, Goddard left the station the following December, amid accusations by employees Goddard had laid off. Production company owner Glenn Davis was hired as his replacement in July 2005. Davis resigned in early 2008 after an investigation into sexual harassment claims could not support nor deny any claims. In 2004, the station renamed itself TV30. That change came with several other attempts to revamp the \\"look\\" of the station. The name of the newscast was changed from \\"The 580/680 News\\" to \\"TV30 News.\\" The news set was changed from a blue-lit grey set handed down from a San Francisco network affiliate, to a remodeled salmon one built by station employees. In Fall 2005, the set was changed again, this time to a new professionally designed one. This was the first of many moves that sent the station hurtling into debt. TV30 News was again renamed in July 2007 to \\"TV30 News Live at 4,\\" to reflect what time the show airs live (the same taped version runs again at 7, 9, and 11). The change brought different graphics with it once again, the third time in as many years the on-air \\"look\\" changed. A new motto also came with the new name: \\"The Pictures. The Stories. Your World\\". On May 1, 2007, it was reported that the station requested $65,000 from each of the four cities to keep running through the end of June (the end of the station's fiscal year). This comes after the station's board of directors was removed, and it was announced that the mayors from the four cities would oversee the station instead. TV30 had used up most of its $100,000 credit line and was $208,000 in debt. On June 30, the \\"TV30 News\\" gave its final broadcast. In 2012 the city of San Ramon announced that in a money saving move it would shift the city's support from Tri-Valley to Contra Costa Television. Since 1984 Tri Valley had covered San Ramon, broadcasting local sports, the city's annual Christmas tree lighting, the annual \\"Mayor's Report,\\" and city council meetings, in exchange for an annual subsidy. Contra Costa offered these services at a lower price. In 2014 Executive Director Melissa Tench-Stevens reported that the Digital TV Fairness Act would cost TV30 over $500,000 annually in lost funding. Today there are new programs airing and being developed which bring the station back to its roots. The station is once again focused on highlighting the events, people and places in the Tri-Valley area.  Management controversies  In December 2004 several employees of the station were removed by Bruce Goddard. Those former employees made public accusations about his management style, and threatened lawsuits to the station's board of directors. None of the employees were reinstated but accusations on behalf of the terminated employees lead to Goddard being placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. No results were officially released. Goddard refused public comment and chose to resign rather than continue under the cloud. After an extensive search for a successor, Glenn Davis was hired as the station's new executive director on July 1, 2005. Davis' reign has had its own share of controversies, with the station falling significantly into debt since his inception. After Davis was hired, the station operated in the red for two years in a row for the first time ever. Furthermore, in mid-August 2007, a Contra Costa Times article came out that said the station was being sued for sexual harassment by the former news director, with Davis the main target of the suit. In late December, another employee made similar accusations, and Davis was again placed on administrative leave. According to a March 5, 2008 article in Pleasanton Weekly, Davis resigned after an investigator concluded there was \\"insufficient evidence\\" to support the claims of harassment made by one former and another current employee. A lawsuit is still pending in Alameda County Superior Court. A March 7, 2008 East Bay Times article says \\"While the board of directors credited Davis with reversing the long-deteriorating technical condition of the station and restructuring the program schedule, he is also associated with the financial overages that led to budget deficits two years in a row.\\" Indeed, Davis oversaw several graphics upgrades and new set designs. Long- running program \\"Everything Local\\" was also taken from a low-budget in-studio community affairs program to a flashy magazine program under Davis's watch. Dublin Mayor Janet Lockhart also told the newspaper \\"It was never intended that we would all be financing a fully functioning competitive station -- that's not what we originally started out to be.... Some of the management leadership has kind of led us in that direction.\\" Following an independent investigation looking into the second sexual harassment investigation against Davis, it was determined that there was insufficient evidence with the claim, but a civil case is still pending in Alameda County. Davis resigned in March 2008. The TV30 Board of Directors advertised for a new Executive Director in June. Roger Bradley, Administrative Analyst for Dublin, was tasked with screening the applications. Bradley received twenty applications; ten of which were selected for interviews. Bradley sent out a press release on September 12, 2008 announcing the appointment of Melissa Tench-Stevens as the new Executive Director of TV30. Tench-Stevens is currently the President and CEO of The Evers Group, LLC in San Jose.  Programming  Tri-Valley Community Television broadcasts public meetings on an ongoing basis, including the city council meetings of each of the four participating jurisdictions, as well as the Pleasanton School Board, the Dublin School Board, the Livermore School Board and the Livermore Area Recreation and Park District. The bulk of the station shows air on channel 30, while the meeting mostly air on 28 and 29. One of the longest running shows at the station has been Let's Talk Sports. Hosted by George \\"Dr. B\\" Baljevich, the show grew from a call-in talk show, to a studio interview talkshow, and later a field production at TV30. The last in-studio taping of this show took place in 2004. Everything Local is another long-running show that started off in-studio, then moved to the field. It was at first hosted by various faces at the station. When it moved to the field, it was hosted by Eboni Warnking, and is now no longer in production. The station also receives money to produce and air several shows, including Livermore Life (paid for by the Livermore Downtown Association) and COPPS (City of Pleasanton Police). Lately there has been a shift away from locally produced programming such as Media Roundtable and Everything Local. The station has started airing programs produced by outside sources such as the University of Hawaii-produced Growing Old in a New Age, and the PBS program California Connected.

In 2007, the name changed again, this time to \\"TV30 News Live At 4\\" to emphasize its live presence. That change brought new features, including a controversial traffic segment. The show was anchored by Tom Morrison since its inception in 1988. George \\"Dr. B\\" Baljevich\\" anchored sports since the beginning. Ian Bartholomew was also a sports anchor, joining in the early 1990s. Shortly after the newscast was launched, Robin Fahr joined Tom Morrison as co-anchor for the show. By 2005, Fahr was only anchoring one or two days a week with Michelle Soba anchoring or Morrison solo-anchoring the rest of the week. Soba took over the desk full-time that year. She left in early 2007, and was replaced by Melinda Meza. By early 2008, financial problems at the station began to mount, with the news bearing the brunt of the blame. In a March 5, 2008 Pleasanton Weekly article, Dublin Mayor and TV30 board chair Janet Lockhart was quoted as saying \\"The news program is the most expensive in the station lineup.\\" Lockhart raised concerns over the newscast in the Pleasanton Weekly article, \\"It makes no sense to me to have a live traffic report aired at 4 p.m. and then the same news repeated through the evening,\\" she added. \\"I also don't understand why our local station reports on news you can watch on regular stations, such as the latest Britney Spears scandal.\\" Citing increased costs at keeping the news afloat, the board ultimately canceled \\"TV30 News Live at 4\\" in April 2008. The board is considering a weekly or monthly news magazine in its place.

Once known as the Seal Rocks Sea Life Centre, the centre is managed by the Phillip Island Nature Park, and features educational displays, a cafe, a children's play area, and a gift shop. Overlooking Seal Rocks, Australia‚Äôs largest colony of fur seals, with an estimated 16,000 inhabiting the area, around half a million people visit the centre yearly, with 53% being international visitors. A network of boardwalks outside the centre allow visitors to view the seal colony, The Nobbies, and The Blowhole. History Looking over The Nobbies towards Seal Rocks Work towards a privately developed marine centre at Point Grant commenced in January 1995 where a call for tenders was made by the Kennett Government. The winner was Seal Rocks Victoria Australia Pty Ltd (SRVA), which signed a 25-year build-operate-transfer contract with the State of Victoria in March 1997. The centre opened in April 1998 as the privately operated \\"Seal Rocks Sea Life Centre\\", with stage one of the development completed at a cost of $13 million, including the Nobbies Centre seen today. Stage two was to cost $50 million, and was to include a 1.9 kilometre long undersea tunnel leading to an observation tower at Seal Rocks. That expansion was opposed by local independent MP Susan Davies, who held the balance of power in the Bracks Government which took power at the 1999 state election. Contractual disputes relating to stage two of the project resulted in SRVA lodging a compensation claim against the State Government for breach of contract, resulting in the appointment of an independent arbitrator in July 2000 to settle the matter. An interim order was handed down in August 2002, finding that the Government had breached the original contract, and required the Government to pay $37.3 million in compensation in addition to the legal fees of the operator. The Government appealed against the order in the Supreme Court of Victoria, and in September 2002 SRVA also lodged its own application in the Supreme Court, seeking up to $400 million as compensation for loss of future earnings. The State Government appeal was rejected in April 2003, with the Auditor-General finding in November 2003 that the final cost to the Government was $55.9 million. That was made up of $37.3 million compensation, $5.6 million in costs to SRVA, and $9.3 million in Government legal fees. The centre itself closed on 12 August 2002, after a mini-tornado tore the roof from the building, causing $200,000 damage and leaving 30 staff members out of work. In May 2005 the State Government announced $7.1 million in funding to repair the centre, which reopened to the public in April 2007.

Storylines 2003‚Äì2005 Shelley fell in love with Alan Turner (Richard Thorp), only to face violent opposition from his psychopathic daughter, Steph (Lorraine Chase). Shelley and Steph later became sworn enemies. Shelley left the village for a while but returned to see Alan, much to Steph's annoyance. Alan was \\"ill\\" in bed being \\"looked after\\" by Steph at this point. Steph lied to Shelley and told her that Alan was asleep and did not want to be disturbed. Shelley told Steph that she was going to collect her things and to see Alan. Steph was angry and pushed Shelley down the cellar stairs and tied her to a chair and gagged her. Shelley later attempted to escape by pushing a pile of boxes onto Steph and kicking Steph in the ribs. However, Steph had the keys to the door of the cellar and grabbed Shelley by the hair and told her that they were going on a little trip only Shelley would not be coming back. After everyone found out what Steph had been doing to Alan, the police questioned her about Shelley's disappearance. Steph told the police she could not remember. Steph was in jail and was having flashbacks of her killing Shelley. When Alan and some other village residents gathered in Shelley's memorial garden Shelley turned up when Alan was on his own. Alan was shocked but delighted to see her alive and well. Shelley told Alan that Steph took her to the woods the day she was in the cellar and that Steph told her to run or she would kill her. When the police discovered Shelly was alive Steph was released. Steph returned to the village and tried to make amends with Shelley and Alan, including Alan's friends in the village. Although Alan thought it would be a good idea to give his daughter a chance, Shelley told Alan that she was evil and can never be forgiven. Shelley confronted Steph in the church and told Steph that she is back and that Steph can never hurt her or Alan again. Steph asked if they could be friends but Shelley told Steph to go to hell. Shelley hated staying in the village whilst Steph was around and decided to leave. Shelley and Alan said farewell and Shelley left in a taxi. Steph told Alan that she would track Shelley down for him and convince her to come back. So Steph tried her hardest to find Shelley. She eventually found her on a ferry. Shelley tried to run away from Steph. When a member of the crew saw Steph had no ticket she was forced to leave the ferry. Shelley shouted good riddance as Steph was walking off. As the ferry began making its way, Shelley went to the top deck and smiled in relief that Steph has gone. However, Steph made it onto the ferry again and tapped Shelley on the shoulder and said \\"surprise\\", much to Shelley's horror. Shelley was furious and began insulting Steph by saying that Alan loves her and Tricia more than Steph, and that all Steph has left is her age. Steph turned round and told Shelley she was coming back to Emmerdale with her. However when Steph grabbed hold of her arm Shelley forced herself back and slipped over the railings and fell into the freezing cold sea below. Shelley was last seen struggling in the water and it is still unknown if she is really dead or not. Steph was shocked and knew she would get the blame for Shelley's death. So she threw her suitcase in the water then left the ferry as if nothing happened. Much later, Shelley's suitcase was found off the coast of Scotland and her bank account had not been touched, despite a large balance. Alan was more convinced that Shelley may be dead. Steph later admitted to her father that the struggle with Shelley was an accident but she is dead. Steph was in court for her brother, Terence Turner's (Nick Brimble) death, despite her husband, Adam Forsythe (Richard Shelton), being responsible for Terence's death. Steph admitted to the court that she watched someone die (referring to Shelley, not Terence). She and her manipulative husband, who later committed suicide in prison, were sentenced to life imprisonment for Terence's murder. Alan was proud of Steph's brave confession for paying for the mistake of Shelley's death. Legacy In 2015, Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) was inspired by Shelley's death when planning to fake her own death to avoid going to prison and persuaded her husband Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) to go along with it.

Early life and playing career Born in the neighbourhood of Mamilla in Jerusalem, Israel, Malmilian had a memorable playing career in the Liga Leumit at Beitar Jerusalem. He is regarded as one of the best Israeli players ever. Malmilian joined the youth system of Beitar at an early age. At the age of sixteen(16), Malmilian had his first appearance in the senior team of Beitar. In this first match he scored a stunning goal from a corner kick. Malmilian had his big breakthrough in the 1976 season. He led the squad to the second place of the league and won Beitar's first important trophy, the Israeli Cup, after his goal in the 90th minute in the Final sealed the title. He was chosen as Player of the Season and was convoked to the National Team even before at the age of 18. This made Uri the youngest player ever to be convoked to Israel national football team. In 1979 Malmilian received a lucrative offer from French club Paris Saint-Germain but he decided to keep playing with Beitar.Levy replaces Malmilian as Betar coach In the next few years he formed a devastating trio with team-mates Danny Neuman and Victor Levy.

There are currently over 100 Australian missions overseas.1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 2001 - Australian Bureau of Statistics After federation in 1901, Australia's presence abroad was largely limited to state and Commonwealth agents and trade offices. The United Kingdom played a defining role in Australia's foreign policy, limiting its need for missions abroad. In 1939 there were only two External Affairs officers posted overseas: one in London (known as Australia House), and one in Washington attached to the UK Embassy. The Second World War necessitated increased co- operation with foreign countries independent of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. By 1940, a base of four missions had been established in Washington, Ottawa, London, and Tokyo, and as World War II progressed missions to Australia's wartime allies were established in Noum√©a, Chongqing, and Moscow. Australian diplomatic missions today number at over 100, although the number of Australian diplomats overseas has dramatically been reduced. Missions have been closed in Bern, Almaty, Damascus, Kupang, Lusaka, Algiers, Cape Town, Dar es Salaam, and Bridgetown. As Australia is a Commonwealth country, its diplomatic missions in the capitals of other Commonwealth countries are referred to as High Commissions (as opposed to embassies). Under the terms of the Canada‚ÄìAustralia Consular Services Sharing Agreement, the two countries provide consular services to each other's citizens at a number of locations around the world. At this time, there are 12 cities where Canadians can obtain consular services from Australian offices, and 19 locations where Canadian offices provide consular services to Australians. In an emergency, Australians can also seek assistance from British diplomatic missions around the world in the absence of an Australian consulate or embassy.

The village occupies a narrow stretch of land between the River Thames and the A34 dual carriageway. It was in Berkshire until the 1974 boundary changes transferred it to Oxfordshire. Overview Kennington was partly in South Hinksey parish and partly in Radley parish until 1936, when a new Kennington civil parish was constituted. Apart from the village, most of Kennington civil parish is wooded, including all of Bagley Wood and West Wood to the west of the village. Manor house The manor house is Jacobean, built in 1629 during the Great Rebuilding of England.Pevsner, 1966, page 160 It is half-timbered, i.e. its upper storey is timber-framed but its lower storey is not. In this case the lower storey is of local limestone. Parish churches St Swithun's former parish church, built 1828. The Church of England parish of St Swithun has two churches. The first is a very early example of the Norman revival, designed by the architect Daniel Robertson and built in 1828.Pevsner, 1966, page 159 The second was built alongside it in 1956-58, designed by a local architect, T. Lawrence Dale, and the vicar, Rev. S.S. Davies. The 1828 building is now deconsecrated. The present St Swithun's parish church, completed 1958. Amenities Kennington has a public house, The Tandem. The village has a health centre, two shops, a post office and a pharmacist. There are two sports fields: Playfield Road and Forestside Education The local primary school is St Swithun's Church of England School. The village is in the catchment area for Matthew Arnold secondary school. Matthew Arnold School is not located in the village but a bus service is provided. Chandlings School, an independent co- educational preparatory school, is nearby. Building developments Over the last few years there has been a great increase in residential building development in the village. The developments are all large houses with large gardens which have been turned into flats. The two exceptions are the new houses at the site of the former public house The Scholar Gypsy (named after the local poet, Matthew Arnold) and flats on the site of the former Kennington Service Station. Recent developments include Strode Court, and Chestnut Place on Kennington Road, to the north of the village. A new development has been completed at the site of Cranbrook House in the south of the village on The Avenue. Local organisations A brass band was set up in the village in 1973, originally named the Kennington (Oxford) Youth Band.Sudworth's History of Kennington (Oxford) Band. The Musical Director was Ron Sudworth. The band grew and developed and was soon entering and winning contests all across England. The word Youth was dropped from its name as the age of the members rose. It won the National 4th Section title at Pontins Holiday Camp in 1977 and progressed to the upper reaches of the National 2nd section by 1981. Although it has long since ceased participating in contests, the band is still very active. It practises each Sunday morning at the Youth Club and performs regularly throughout Oxfordshire and beyond.

The magazine grew to its greatest international influence towards in latter half of its life of sixty years; on the leading edge of almost every important period in photography, Camera was often among the first publications to show the first works of now well-known photographers such as Edward Steichen, Robert Frank and Jeanloup Sieff. Adopting the name, design and spirit of the magazine's most successful years, in a venture independent of its former publishers, editor Bruno Bonnabry-Duval and journalist Brigitte Ollier re-launched Camera as a quarterly review: the first edition appeared in kiosks on 17 January 2013. The early years: 1922-1947 The first German-language issue of Camera was published by the engineer Adolf Herz and book-publisher C. J. Bucher in June 1922. Making clear its aim to aid the development of the still-fledgling art of photography, this issue began with the following statement of intent: > With this issue we introduce ourselves to the public for the first time. We > would like to say a few words about our aims. Our magazine will support > artistic photography. We thought it expedient to show our readers an > artist's work through ample selections of good-quality reproductions. > Artists from all countries will be sharing their pictures. Hereon in every > issue we will present eight pages of good reproductions. Participating > artists will present their art styles in original essays. Articles on > technical photographic subjects, written by authors the best in this field, > will appear in the technical section. In brief reports we will comment on > all new developments so that our readers can obtain an up-to-date view of > photography. We invite all photographers and researchers of all countries > who would like to bring technical information to our readers, to submit > their articles. We will periodically conduct contests to encourage > developing artists, and the best entries will receive a monetary award. We > hope our efforts will be conducive to the high aims of artistic photography > and that our readers will support us. Adolf Herz first made the magazine's 'high-quality prints' with a dull-finish semi-matte paper that gave a result only mimicking the still-new sheet-fed gravure system, but eventually moved to the latter technique when the B√ºcher publishing company adopted the technology from 1925. The publishing half of the partnership had changed after C. J. Bucher's stroke in 1941: from then his wife, Alice, unofficially took over the direction of the publishing company, and she would become the official director upon her husband's death in 1950. Herz's period as editor of Camera, ending in 1947, was marked for its focus on Pictorialism. Contributing photographers from this period and style were Heinrich K√ºhn, L√©onard Missone, Hoffmeister, Craig Annan, Edward Steichen, Kieghley and Demachy. 1947-1965 July 1953 edition, soon after the creation of a new 'Camera' logo by Walter L√§ubli. The post-war period was an important one for Camera, with the publication of the earliest works of photographers Jakob Tuggener, Gotthard Schuh, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa (and Magnum), Bill Brandt and Robert Frank. Walter L√§ubli became chief editor, or 'art director' as the position was called then, from January 1948. The 1949 special issue featured Robert Frank's first published photography, and was Camera's first important mark on international photo-journalism. To better expand the Camera readership, L√§ubli introduced articles translated into English and French from their native German, making the magazine a trilingual one. He also re-looked the magazine and graced it with a new logo that would remain practically unchanged until the magazine's 1981 demise. The graphic designer Hans Neuburg succeeded L√§ubli from 1952, and led the editorial board until 1954. He was unofficially succeeded for two years by Imre Reiner, then Romeo Martinez appeared as the next editor in chief from July 1956. From the March 1957 issue onward, Camera Martinez transformed Camera from a trilingual magazine into three separate English, French and German editions, and returned the magazine to a purely photographic one. As Martinez was not a photographer but a journalist with an acute knowledge of art and the history of photography, the magazine under his direction was able to reach an unforeseen larger readership. Camera from 1960 entered an association with Europhot, an organisation of European Professional Photographers, from when four issues a year, labelled \\"Camera EUROPHOT\\", under the direction of a special Europhot panel, would treat subjects of concern to the professional photographers of their usual audience. Romeo Martinez left the magazine without a replacing editor after the May 1964 edition, but the magazine continued under Bucher and the remaining Camera staff. The Porter years Cover of the November 1973 issue Allan Porter first appeared from December 1965 as a guest editor, but became the editor in chief from January the following year. Mrs. Bucher's choice of Mr. Porter, an American citizen with few connections to Europe, was a hard sell, but it was thought that his talent for design and 'foreign touch' could be a great aid to a magazine then in difficulty. Under the direction of Allan Porter, Camera was marked not only by its search for talent in the leading frontiers of modern photography, but for its examination, from a modern viewpoint, of the works of past masters. Camera's 1965 circulation was at 9,300 copies, all languages combined. Porter had promised an 8% circulation increase over a period of nine months, but through an active effort to increase subscriptions (namely through long-term contracts with libraries and other institutions), an increased American circulation through an agreement with New York City-based Acme Publications, and a new approach to the magazine's advertising department and ad sales, circulation had risen by 20% by the end of the year. Allan celebrated his 100th issue with the April 1974, Vol 53, No. 4 edition showing his favorite genre, landscapes. It featured the works of Don Eddy on the cover and inside. Other photographers in the issue were Vincent Vallarino; Charles H. Caffin; Klaus Ott; T.C. Tilney; David Bayles; Carl Georg Heise; L√©onard Misonne; George A. Tice; Sadakichi Hartmann. C. J. Bucher AG was taken over by the Ringier printing company in 1973. The new owners saw no interest in Camera, yet instead of ending the publication altogether, Ringier thought that by withdrawing all but a minimum promotional support, readership interest would dwindle and the magazine would find a natural end on its own. One of the first limitations Ringier would impose was a switch to the faster and cheaper lithographic offset printing system rather than the slower and more expensive sheet-fed gravure technology used until then. Porter, having reservations about how Camera's readership would react to the drop in printing quality, with the help of technicians from the still- functioning gravure department, managed to develop a two-colour duplex offset system that would at the same time cut costs and maintain quality. After eight more years of production Ringier decided that Camera was not in the company interests, and marked December 1981, a date a few months short of the magazine's 60th anniversary, as the month of its final issue. Camera as a reference Camera was a longtime reference for all things photographic, and was among the first to publish many works from today's great masters. Some of the world's biggest libraries, such as the National Library of France in Paris carry hard-bound editions of Camera as reference works.

Because the sound produced has a distinctly flatulent tone, such music is usually presented as a form of musical comedy or parody. The musical performer is called a manualist, who may perform a cappella or with instrumental accompaniment. Playing recognizable tunes by squeezing the hands together is extremely difficult, and could take many years of practice to master the art.The Manualism Page, by Gaston and Purcell Some manualists practice for as many as 30 years before finally reaching a presentable level of proficiency. Technique Just as a trumpeter makes sound by blowing air between the lips, a manualist makes sound by squeezing air between two hands. The hands are held together, trapping a pocket of air between the two palms.R. A. Wilson radio interview, \\"Hand Music: No Manual Needed\\", NPR: Morning Edition, July 25, 2006 (text and audio) Using the fingers of one hand, the air is squeezed out the top, between the base of the thumb and the opposite hand, to form a musical note. The pitch is determined by the force used to hold the hands together. The tighter the grip, the higher the note.R. A. Wilson video interview , \\"An Interview with R. A.

It is managed by West Midlands Trains, who provide the majority of train services; Chiltern Railways also operate a small number. History The station, which opened in 1866, was historically part of the Great Western Railway, and was at the junction of the line from Birmingham to Stourbridge Junction with lines to Dudley and via Halesowen to Longbridge. The two latter lines have long since been closed. The original station buildings have also been removed. Because it was a junction station, the platforms were staggered, with the Birmingham-bound platform offset by a short distance. A further junction in the Stourbridge direction allowed trains to traverse the Bumble Hole Line, which ran to Dudley. That line closed in 1964. To the east of the current station were private railway sidings serving Palmer Timber's Yard, which have long been removed. The original timber station buildings were badly damaged by fire on 13 September 1967, and that prompted the modernisation of station, with the new building opening on 22 May 1968. The station footbridge was moved to different location from that of the original one, which was towards the Stourbridge end of the platform. With rationalising of signalling, the signal box that served Old Hill was demolished in 1973. Services The typical Monday-Saturday daytime service is every 30 minutes, between Stourbridge Junction and Stratford-upon-Avon via Birmingham Snow Hill. During the daytime, services run alternately via and via ; in the evenings the frequency remains unchanged but one service runs between Dorridge and . On Sundays, trains are hourly.

Career Lamborn made 22 known appearances in first-class cricket, beginning with Surrey in 1777. He played for Chertsey Cricket Club in 1778. He played several games for All- England and then for Hampshire from 1780. In 1781, he was also associated with Sir Horatio Mann in east Kent but was not recorded again after that season. Few personal details of Lamborn are known, though it has been supposed his first name was William, but this is based on an error arising from confusion with the much later cricketer William Lambert. Lamborn's nickname among his fellow players was \\"The Little Farmer\\", which does at least give some clues concerning his size and occupation.Nyren (ed. Mote), p.66. Innovation Lamborn seems to have been something of a sensation in his apparently short career for he was a most unorthodox bowler. He was a right arm underarm spin bowler with a low, flighted delivery and what has been described as a \\"twist from off to leg\\" (i.e., an off-break).Nyren (ed. Mote), pp.66‚Äì67. The natural way for an underarm bowler to spin the ball is the leg-break (i.e., from the leg side and towards the off side of a right-handed batsman) but Lamborn seems to have invented the off-break by spinning from the off side and towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman.Birley, 50. It is said he was \\"no batter\\" and the scorecards confirm this. The pitched delivery was still new, having been introduced in the 1760s, when Lamborn played. Until the 1760s, bowlers had always rolled or skimmed the ball towards the batsman so spin bowling itself was a new skill. According to John Nyren, Lamborn was \\"the first I remember who introduced this deceitful and teasing style of delivering the ball\\". Anecdote Lamborn is the subject of a famous anecdote in which he informed the Duke of Dorset about one near miss that: \\"It was tedious near your Grace!\\" Lamborn had a strong rural accent and the way he said this apparently amused the Duke for some time to come.Nyren (ed. Mote), p.67.

Wangen bei Olten Minaret controversy Mosque in Wangen bei Olten The construction of a six-meter (20 ft) high minaret in Wangen in 2005 led to a constitutional ban on their construction on 29 November 2009. The contention involved the Turkish cultural association, which applied for a construction permit to erect a minaret on the roof of its Islamic community centre. The project faced opposition from surrounding residents, who formed a group to prevent the tower's erection. The Turkish association claimed that the building authorities improperly and arbitrarily delayed its building application. They also believed that the members of the local opposition group were motivated by religious bias. The Communal Building and Planning Commission rejected the association's application. The applicants appealed to the Building and Justice Department, which reverted the decision and remanded. As a consequence of that decision, local residents (who were members of the group mentioned) and the commune of Wangen brought the case before the Administrative Court of the Canton of Solothurn, but failed with their claims. On appeal the Federal Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the lower court. The minaret was eventually erected in July 2009.Media Information of the Federal Supreme Court While the case led to a ban on further minaret construction, it did not affect the four minarets already then in existence in Switzerland, including that of Wangen bei Olten.

It is a relatively short highway, extending for only from U.S. Highway 277 (US-277) in Elgin to Business US-81 in Rush Springs. It has no lettered spur routes (it does not connect to SH-17A in Wynnewood). SH-17 was first established as a state highway, connecting Sterling to Rush Springs, in the mid-1930s. It was later extended west over a portion of SH-65, bringing its western terminus to Elgin. Route description SH-17 begins at U.S. Highway 277 in the north-central part of Elgin. SH-17 proceeds due east out of town for approximately before turning southeast. Around west of Sterling, the route returns to a due east course, then curves slightly to the south as it enters town. On the west side of town, SH-17 serves as the northern terminus of SH-65, which follows 5th Avenue southward out of town. SH-17 continues east through Sterling along Main Street. East of Sterling, SH-17 crosses Beaver Creek near its source. About east of SH-65, SH-17 crosses the Comanche‚ÄìGrady county line. The route then turns northeast, turning back east to follow the same line of latitude it originally followed in Elgin. The highway passes south of the ghost town of Acme. On the west side of Rush Springs, it intersects the US-81 expressway bypass of the town. SH-17 then continues east along Blakeley Avenue into downtown Rush Springs, where it ends at US-81's Rush Springs business loop. History The present-day State Highway 17 was commissioned between May 1936 and April 1937. Originally, the all-dirt highway began in Sterling and ran to Rush Springs; the Sterling‚ÄìElgin portion of the highway was at that time part of SH-65. However, at some point between April 1937 and April 1938, SH-65 was truncated to the south, and SH-17 was extended west to Elgin along the former route of SH-65.

Their powers went far beyond those of most diplomats and can be compared to those of viceroysHamish M. Scott, The Emergence of the Eastern Powers, 1756‚Äì1775, Cambridge University Press, 2001, , Google Print, p.249] in the colonies of Spanish Empire, or Roman Republic's proconsuls in Roman provinces. During most of that period ambassadors and envoys from the Russian Empire, acting on the instructions from Saint Petersburg, held a de facto position superior to that of the Polish king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Backed by the presence of the Russian army within the borders of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, and leveraging the immense wealth of the Russian Empire, they were able to influence both the king and the Polish parliament, the Sejm. According to their demands, the king dispensed the Commonwealth offices among the Russian supporters, and the Sejm, bribed or threatened, voted as the Russians dictated. The agenda of the Permanent Council (Polish government) was edited and approved by the Russian ambassador, and the members of the Council were approved by him. Their power also manifested itself in many aspects of daily life, especially in the Polish capital of Warsaw: for example, a performance in the theatre would be delayed until the Russian ambassador arrived, even if the Polish king himself was present. In another incident, a Russian ambassador who arrived late in the theatre, with the Polish king again present, demanded that the spectacle should be restarted. Eventually this forceful expression of Russian diplomacy, backed by the military might of the Empire, and despite a few setbacks like the Bar Confederation, Constitution of May 3, 1791 and Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, achieved its goal of expanding Russian control over most of the Commonwealth territory and population. Background (before 1763) Beginning in the second half of the 18th century, the unique political system of the Commonwealth, the quasi-democraticMaciej Janowski, Polish Liberal Thought, Central European University Press, 2001, , Google Print: p.3 Golden Liberty, had turned into anarchy.Martin Van Gelderen, Quentin Skinner, Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Cambridge University Press, 2002, Google Print: p.54 The Polish nobility's (szlachta) privilege of liberum veto, first introduced as a safeguard against tyranny of the monarch, allowed any deputy to the Sejm to stop and annul the entire session. This was soon seen by the neighbouring powers - especially Prussia and Russia - as the perfect opportunity to disrupt the Commonwealth from inside, and soon many Sejms were dissolved by a deputy bribed by one of the foreign powers.William Bullitt, The Great Globe Itself: A Preface to World Affairs, Transaction Publishers, 2005, , Google Print, p.42-43John Adams, The Political Writings of John Adams, Regnery Gateway, 2001, , Google Print, p.242 With an impotent Sejm, the Commonwealth stagnated, as it was impossible to reform the government, raise taxes or increase the size of the army. In 1717, Russia cemented its position as the dominant force in Poland, in the aftermath of the Great Northern War and amid the growing likelihood of a civil war in Poland between the Polish king August II the Strong and the Polish nobility. Russian tsar Peter I the Great, posing as the conciliator between the Commonwealth king and the szlachta, ordered units of the Russian army to enter Polish territory‚Äîusing the treaties of alliance from the Great Northern War‚Äîand coerced the Polish Sejm of 1717 into accepting his 'compromise'. During that Sejm (known as the Silent Sejm, as only one person was allowed to speak aloud), laws were passed that not only eliminated the possibility of August strengthening his power, but also ensured by means of restricted taxation (and thus a constrained Polish army) that Poland would not be able to interfere with similar Russian interventions in the future. In reality, if not the letter of the law, the reforms of the Silent Sejm meant that the Commonwealth became a Russian protectorate, and it would be Russian ambassadors and envoys who would be responsible for this territory under the tsar. In 1730 than Russian ambassador to Poland, Karl Gustav von L√∂wenwolde, was instrumental in the Alliance of the Three Black Eagles (or L√∂wenwolde's Treaty), an agreement between Commonwealth's neighbours to preserve the dysfunctional state of affairs within it. Russian influence on Poland further increased during the War of the Polish Succession (1733‚Äì1738), when Russian military intervention overturned the result of the royal election of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. Herman Karl von Keyserling (1763‚Äì1764) Herman Karl von Keyserling Russian influence would not become permanent until the death of the Polish king August III the Saxon in 1764. During the free election that followed his death, one of the Polish magnate families, the Czartoryski party, known as the Familia, allied itself with Russia and, backed by the Russian army, forced the election of their relative (and former lover of Russian tsarina Catherine II the Great) Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. The Russian envoy overseeing the Familia's action and the election of Poniatowski was Herman Karl von Keyserling. Among other things, to ensure Poniatowski's victory he bribed the interrex of Poland, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Aleksander ≈Åubie≈Ñski, with a significant sum of about 100,000 Russian rubles. The Russian army entered Poland again under the pretext of protecting Polish citizens from civil war. With such support, Poniatowski was soon elected king. Nicholas Repnin (1764‚Äì1768) Nicholas Repnin. Keyserling, who died in September, was soon replaced by Nicholas Repnin, who would become perhaps the most infamous of the Russian envoys of that period. In order to strengthen the Russian influence, he encouraged the civil war within the Commonwealth, also encouraging the conflict between Protestant and Catholic factions within the Polish nobility. This led to the formation of two Protestant konfederacjas (of Sluck and Toru≈Ñ) and later, one Catholic (Radom Confederation, led by Karol Stanis≈Çaw \\"Panie Kochanku\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç). Before the Sejm of 1767, he ordered the capture and exile to Kaluga of some vocal opponents of his policies, namely J√≥zef Andrzej Za≈Çuski and Wac≈Çaw Rzewuski. Through the Polish nobles in his employ (like Gabriel Podoski, primate of Poland) or threatened by the presence of over 10,000 Russian soldiers in Warsaw in the very chambers of the parliament, Repnin, despite some misgivings about the methods he was ordered to employ, de facto dictated the terms of that Sejm. The intimidated Sejm, which met in October 1767 and adjourned in February 1768, appointed a commission (the so-called Delegated Sejm) which drafted a Polish‚ÄìRussian treaty, approved in \\"silent session\\" (without debate) on February 27, 1768.Poland the Confederation of Bar, 1768‚Äì1772 The legislation undid some of the reforms of 1764 under Stanislaw II and pushed through legislation which ensured that the political system of the Commonwealth would be ineffective and easy to control by its foreign neighbours. The liberum veto, free election, neminem captivabimus, rights to form the confederation and rokosz‚Äîin other words, all the important old privileges of the nobility, which made the Commonwealth political system (the Golden Liberty) so ungovernable‚Äîwere guaranteed as unalterable parts in the cardinal laws. Repnin's Sejm marked one of the important milestones in increasing Polish dependence on the Russian Empire, and its devolution into a protectorate. This dependent position was bluntly spelled out in Nikita Ivanovich Panin's letter to King Poniatowski, in which he made it clear that Poland was now in the Russian sphere of influence. Nonetheless the Russian intervention led to the Confederation of Bar, which practically destroyed the ambassador's handiwork. The resulting civil war in Poland, involving Russia, lasted from 1768 to 1772. Mikhail Volkonsky (1769‚Äì1771) Mikhail Volkonsky. For his failure in preventing the formation of Bar Confederation, Repnin was dismissed. On 22 May 1769 he was replaced by the envoy and minister Prince Mikhail Volkonsky, a high-ranking officer in the Russian Army who had been stationed in Poland since 1761. Volkonsky's orders were even more direct; in 1770 he demanded that the Czartoryski family be exiled from the Commonwealth, and when King Poniatowski asked what authority the ambassador had to demand the punishment of foreign citizens, he threatened the king with the reporting of his opposition to the Russian court. Caspar von Saldern (1771‚Äì1772) Caspar von Saldern. Caspar von Saldern, proteg√© of Nikita Ivanovich Panin, and former diplomat of Holstein, became the next ambassador in April 1771. His service was marked by a significant change in Russian policy. An attempt by the Bar Confederates to kidnap king Poniatowski on 3 November 1771, in Warsaw, sent a signal that Poniatowski's position was weak and Poland had not been entirely turned into a Russian protectorate. In order to protect some of its gains, and with the approval and encouragement of Prussia and Austria-Hungary, Catherine II started to consider the first partition of Poland. Saldern's given task was to convince the king and the Czartoryski family to support militarily Russia's crushing of the confederates. They all refused. He fell into disfavor with Catherine, and after he was excluded from the negotiations related to the first partition of Poland, he asked for his own dismissal.Otto Brandt, Caspar von Saldern und die nordeurop√§ische Politik im Zeitalter Katharinas II, Erlangen und Kiel 1932. Otto Magnus von Stackelberg (1772‚Äì1790) Otto Magnus von Stackelberg After the treaty of the First Partition, signed in February, was made public on 5 August 1772, Otto Magnus von Stackelberg became the new ambassador. His task was to ensure that the Polish Sejm would ratify the treaty. The Partition Sejm, with many of its deputies bribed by the Russian embassy, indeed ratified the treaty (on 30 September 1773), and established the Permanent Council ‚Äì a small body that both promised to reform the inefficient Polish governance which, Stackelberg thought, could also be easily controlled by Russia. In 1776, Stackelberg permitted King Poniatowski to carry out several minor reforms, but in 1780 von Stackelberg's protest resulted in the derailing of Zamoyski's Codex, a proposed set of reforms drafted by kanclerz Andrzej Zamoyski which would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. Russia did not want a completely governmentless Poland, as was seen in their support for the Permanent Council, yet the Zamoyski Codex, which offered a chance for the significant reform of the Polish governance, was also not friendly to Russia. Stackelberg also opposed most reforms proposed by Poniatowski from 1778 to 1786. On 27 May 1787, he derailed yet another Polish policy which seemed threatening to Russia. With few major wars in the past decades, the economy of the Commonwealth was improving, and its budget had a notable surplus. Many voices said that the money should be spent on increasing the size, and providing new equipment for, the Polish army. However, as a large Polish army could be a threat to the Russian garrisons controlling Poland, von Stackelberg ordered his proxies in the Permanent Council to spend the money on a different goal: for the huge sum of 1 million zlotys (representing most of the surplus), the Council bought the von Br√ºhl's Palace ‚Äì and promptly donated it to 'Poland's ally', Russia, to serve as Russia's new embassy. Nonetheless, von Stackelberg, and the entire Russian control over Poland, was soon to suffer a major defeat. With Russian attention being diverted to the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92) and the Russo-Swedish War (1788‚Äì90), Catherine approved some limited reforms in Poland, with the goal of transforming Poland into a more useful (and efficient) ally. However, when the opportunity for major reform presented itself during the \\"Great\\" or \\"Four-Year Sejm\\" of 1788‚Äì1792, which opened on October 6, 1788, and from 1790‚Äîa new alliance between the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seemed to provide even further security against Russian intervention,Piotr Stefan Wandycz, The Price of Freedom: A History of East Central Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present, Routledge (UK), 2001, , Google Print, p.128 the Polish reformers managed to carry out increasing numbers of reform despite Stackelberg's opposition. Yakov Bulgakov (1790‚Äì1792) Yakov Bulgakov. The Polish‚ÄìPrussian alliance angered Catherine II, who recalled von Stackelberg and replaced him with Yakov Bulgakov. This, however, changed little: Russia was still occupied with the Ottomans, and the Prussians played their own game, further giving Catherine a pause before ordering any intervention. Bulgakov was further outmaneuvered by the Polish reformers when King Stanis≈Çaw August drew closer to leaders of the reform- minded Patriotic Party (Stanis≈Çaw Ma≈Çachowski, Ignacy Potocki, Hugo Ko≈Ç≈ÇƒÖtaj, Stanis≈Çaw Staszic and others). Finally the reformers pulled a quasi-coup d'etat, voting for a new constitution, the Constitution of May 3, 1791, when most of the pro-Russian deputies (Muscovite Party) were away for the Easter recess. The Constitution which drastically reformed the Commonwealth coincided with the end of the Russo-Turkish war. The members of the Muscovite Party, who felt secure with the previous status quo and under Russian protection, formed the Targowica Confederation, and requested Catherine II to intervene to restore their freedoms. A month after the Constitution was signed Bulgakov informed the Polish king that Russian forces were responding to their request and entering Poland in order to 'restore order' - although in fact they were there to abolish the constitution which threatened the Russian control over Poland.Paul W. Schroeder, The Transformation of European Politics 1763‚Äì1848, Oxford University Press, 1996, , Google print p.84 The Prussians were also appalled at the possibility of strong constitutional monarchy at their border.Carl L. Bucki, The Constitution of May 3, 1791 , Text of a presentation made at the Polish Arts Club of Buffalo on the occasion of the celebrations of Poland's Constitution Day on May 3, 1996, last accessed on 20 March 2006 Poland forces, numerically inferior to Russians (at about 1:3), were eventually defeated in the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Constitution was abolished, and the Second Partition of Poland took place. Jacob Sievers (1793) Jacob Sievers. On 16 February 1793 Bulgakov was replaced by Jacob Sievers, envoy and minister. His orders were to ensure the ratification of the treaty of the Second Partition. Russian representatives bribed some deputies and the Russian army's presence influenced the election of their favoured candidates at local sejmiks. At the Grodno Sejm, the last Sejm of the Commonwealth, any deputies who opposed the Russian presence or demands were threatened with beatings, arrests, sequestration or exile. Many deputies were not allowed to speak, and the main issue on the agenda was the project of 'Eternal Alliance of Poland and Russia', sent to the Sejm by Russian Tsarina Catherine the Great, and presented to the Sejm as the 'request of Polish people' by the Polish supporters of Russia. Eventually with all the deputies cowed into agreement by Russian soldiers present in the chamber, and with none willing to speak out against the treaty, the Second Partition was declared to have passed by unanimous vote. Iosif Igelstr√∂m (1793‚Äì1794) Iosif Igelstr√∂m In December 1793 Sievers was replaced by the last Russian envoy and ambassador, Iosif Igelstr√∂m (), who already from late 1792 was the commander-in-chief of the Russian forces in Poland. His main goal was to ensure the demobilization of most of the Commonwealth army; however he was interrupted by the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising which started in March 1794 - first in the series of several uprisings against the partitioners of Poland that would shake Poland over the next century. In April 1794 during the Warsaw Uprising Russian garrisons, commanded by Igelstr√∂m, sustained heavy losses. The Russian embassy had a special fund, Jurgielt, from which hundreds of Polish politicians and officials were receiving a stable yearly pension. During the Uprising, the Russian embassy was captured, and among the captured documents were the lists of various Polish officials on the Russian payroll; Pawe≈Ç Wro≈Ñski, Gazeta Wyborcza, Rozmowa z prof.

For his failure to prevent the uprising Igelstr√∂m was demoted; nonetheless, after the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, the Third Partition of Poland resulted in the complete destruction of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. Most of its territories were partitioned among its neighbors, and the new incarnation of Poland, Congress Poland, was an obvious Russian puppet state. Therefore, Russian diplomacy, backed by the military might of the Empire, and despite a few setbacks like the Bar Confederation, the Constitution of May 3, 1791 and the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising had achieved its goal, expanding Russian control over most of the Commonwealth territory and population.

Co-creator of Rankin/Bass Productions with his friend Jules Bass, he created stop-motion animation features such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, and the 1977 cartoon special of The Hobbit. He is credited on over 1,000 television programs. Early life Rankin was born in New York City, the son of actors Arthur Rankin and Marian Mansfield. His paternal grandmother was actress Phyllis Rankin, and his paternal step- grandfather, who adopted his father, was actor Harry Davenport, who played Dr. Meade in the film Gone with the Wind. Career Rankin began his career as an art director for the American Broadcasting Company in the 1940s. In 1955, he and Jules Bass formed the production company Videocraft International to produce television commercials. In 1960, they moved into the area of animation, and changed the name of their company to Rankin/Bass Productions. The two worked closely together for many years, co-directing and producing a wide array of stop motion animated features and cartoons, which Rankin had referred to as \\"Animagic\\". In addition to directing, Rankin primarily created the script and sketched the character concepts, which would be made into the wooden puppets by Japanese artists, including head supervisor and partner, Tadahito Mochinaga. Maury Laws, a musical director for Rankin/Bass, stated that Rankin was inspired by the film King Kong, and that Rankin \\"wanted every detail right\\" in creating these shorts. Some of the most famous features were the holiday-themed TV specials, such as Willy McBean and his Magic Machine, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, The Year Without a Santa Claus, Frosty the Snowman, Twas the Night Before Christmas, and Jack Frost. Many of these holiday-themed works are now considered \\"perennial favorites\\", according to The New York Times. He is also credited with devising the story for many Rankin/Bass productions, including the feature films The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party? In 1977, Rankin and Bass produced a version of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, for which they were awarded the Peabody Award. The pair also teamed on a wide variety of animated TV series, including ThunderCats and Silverhawks. The pair last teamed on the 1987 TV special based on The Wind in the Willows. Rankin's last producing credit was on the 1999 animated version of The King and I. Later life Rankin met his wife-to-be, Olga Karlatos, after he cast her in a 1983 television adaption of The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Sins of Dorian Gray. They settled in Bermuda, with Rankin looking to continue to produce stage shows; he noted \\"I could go up to Broadway and run up and down the street and scream, 'I want to write and direct a play!' They'd put me in the nuthouse. If I say that [in Bermuda], everyone springs into action, 'Oh, please, please.'\\" In addition to this, Rankin also taught courses on film and entertainment at Bermuda College. Death Rankin died after a brief illness on January 30, 2014, aged 89, in his home at Harrington Sound, Bermuda. Referring to him as an \\"animation legend\\", The Hollywood Reporter noted that during his career, Rankin worked with actors such as Jeff Bridges, Mia Farrow, Angela Lansbury, Alan Arkin, Danny Kaye, James Cagney, Fred Astaire, Boris Karloff, Tallulah Bankhead, George Burns, John Huston, Burl Ives, James Earl Jones, Christopher Lee, Walter Matthau, Vincent Price and Flip Wilson. He was buried in Sunnyside, Bermuda's Holy Trinity Church Cemetery.  Filmography  Rankin was credited on over 1,000 TV shows and films.

It was first isolated by German scientist W. Knop in 1844 and first synthesized between 1933-1937 by Curd and Robertson. Usnic acid was identified in many genera of lichens including Usnea, Cladonia, Hypotrachyna, Lecanora, Ramalina, Evernia, Parmelia and Alectoria. Although it is generally believed that usnic acid is exclusively restricted to lichens, in a few unconfirmed isolated cases the compound was found in kombucha tea and non-lichenized ascomycetes. At normal conditions, usnic acid is a bitter, yellow, solid substance. It is known to occur in nature in both the d- and l-forms as well as a racemic mixture. Salts of usnic acid are called usnates (e.g. copper usnate). Biological role in lichens Usnic acid is a secondary metabolite in lichens whose role has not been completely elucidated. It is believed that usnic acid protects the lichen from adverse effects of sunlight exposure and deters grazing animals with its bitter taste. Biosynthesis Usnic acid is a polyketide biosynthesized via methylphloroacetophenone as an intermediate. Proposed biosynthesis for usnic acid Safety Usnic acid and its salts are idiosyncratically associated with severe hepatotoxicity and liver failure. Daily oral intake of 300‚Äì1350 mg over a period of weeks has led to severe hepatotoxicity in a number of persons. Sodium usniate was one ingredient in a product called \\"Lipokinetix\\" that was claimed to induce weight loss via an increase in metabolic rate. Lipokinetix has been the topic of an FDA warning in the USA due to potential hepatotoxicity, although it is unclear yet if any toxicity would be attributable to the aforementioned salt. Lipokinetix also contained norephedrine (PPA), caffeine, yohimbine and 3,5-diiodothyronine. Pharmacology Usnic acid has been found to have adrenergic activity in both frog and earthworm nerve junction models in preliminary research.Harris N. J. (1961), Honors Thesis, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts Analytics It is possible to determine the content of usnic acid in lichen extract using reversed-polarity capillary zone electrophoretic analysis.

Population: History The village of Belovo for the first time is mentioned in 1726. It was named after a fugitive peasant Fyodor Belov, who built a small taiga house, a so-called zaimka, on the bank of the Bachat River. The year of 1855 was a new page in the history of settlement: the mining of mineral resources on the found coal field began. In 1938, Belovo was granted town status. The town developed as a conglomeration of departmental settlements, whose population was directly or indirectly involved with the coal mines, a power station, and the railway. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Belovo serves as the administrative center of Belovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with four urban-type settlements (Bachatsky, Gramoteino, Inskoy, and Novy Gorodok) and two rural localities, incorporated separately as Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #215-OZ As a municipal division, Belovo Town Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Belovsky Urban Okrug.Law #104-OZ Government The town is governed by the Council of the People's Deputies, which consists of five committees, the Head of Town, Town Administration, and structural divisions. Economy Belovo railway station (1964-2014) Belovo bus station (1975-2012) Belovo is the important transport unit of Kuzbass: it is situated approximately on the half way between regional center Kemerovo and the city of Novokuznetsk and is connected with them by railway and highway of republican value ¬´Kemerovo - Mezhdurechensk¬ª. 18% of all Kuzbass coal is mined at Belovo. By the volume of extracted coal the city is a stable member of three leaders together with Novokuznetsk and Mezhdurechensk. 63% of industrial outputs of the city are due to coal extraction, which is performed at 4 open pits and 5 underground mines. The largest in Russia the open-cast ¬´Bachatskii¬ª has marked its 60th anniversary in 2009. Four thousand people work at it. The open-cast exports its production to CIS countries as well as to other foreign countries. More than 6.5 thousand people work at Belovo mines. Belovo district power station produces one third of electric power of Kuzbass. Such unique companies, as ¬´Belovo zinc plant¬ª, JSC and ¬´Sibelcom¬ª, JSC (the monopolist in Russia to produce switching stuff), work in Belovo area. Other firms of the city, such as ¬´Belovo machine works¬ª, JSC, ¬´Belovo energoremontnyi zavod¬ª, JSC; ¬´Belovo –°–ï–ú–ú¬ª, JSC, etc. should be mentioned. The economical outlooks of Belovo first of all depend on development of its coal firms and concomitant industry. Social sphere Central Palace of Culture Medical care to the population of the city is rendered by 27 medical entities. There are 25 libraries in Belovo, 3 Art Schools, 8 Musical Schools, 3 Cinemas, 16 clubs and Houses of Culture, Exhibition Hall and Local Park. There also 8 Stadiums and 60 Sporting halls, Chess club, House of sports. There are also social asylum for children and adolescents, social - rehabilitation center for minors. Education Consequentially, due to the proximity of the city to the operational coalfields, a group of settlements in the huge terrain have defined a large number of objects of the social sphere (more than 240 entities). Among them - 41 secondary schools and 5 evening schools, 34 preschool entities, palace of creativity of Children and Youth, –± professional schools, medical school, pedagogical and polytechnic colleges, Belovo branch of Kemerovo State University, branches of the Kuzbass Technical University, Tomsk University of Architecture and Building, Tomsk Polytechnic University.

It appears on the album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). Lyrics and music The song is about the struggle of World War II on the people of Great Britain. The song paraphrases parts of several of Prime Minister Winston Churchill's famous speeches including Never was so much owed by so many to so few, We shall fight on the beaches and This was their finest hour. In addition to Winston Churchill, the song mentions several other political, military and popular figures who were prominent during the war including Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, Louis Mountbatten and Vera Lynn (quoting her song \\"We'll Meet Again\\"). The song features a striking example of integration of sound effects into an arrangement, in this case a vintage air-raid siren which introduces a new section.It is not clear whether this sound comes or not from the BBC Sound Library. Both the Kinks in End of the Season and the Beatles in a take of Across the Universe used the same bird song extracts The Kinks had been experimenting with the use of sound effects since the 1966 Face to Face album. Ray Davies is also featured on lead vocals. When talking about the song (and Churchill himself) Ray Davies stated, \\"Today TV exposed weaknesses in politicians ... But I don't know about Winston Churchill. He may have been a bit more ruthless than we've been led to believe. When the battle's over and you've won, you always look good.

However, it saw single release on 12 December 1969, where it was released as the B-side of the \\"Victoria\\" single in Britain. Unlike other tracks on Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), \\"Mr. Churchill Says\\" has generally received mixed reviews from critics. Rolling Stone's J.R.

It is a transequatorial migrant, moving toward subarctic waters of the Pacific after raising its young. It is fairly common well off the West Coast of the United States during the country's warmer months. The pink-footed shearwater feeds on mainly fish, squid, and crustaceans. This bird nests in burrows, preferring forested slopes. It is a colonial nester. Numbers of this shearwater have been reduced due to predation by introduced species, such as rats and cats. Some loss of birds also occurs from becoming entangled in fishing gear. References Further reading *Carboneras, Carles (1992): 54. Pink-footed Shearwater.

The film tells the story of Aditi Pandit, a happily married woman whose husband Srikant becomes suspicious when she unexpectedly receives a fortune willed to her by her former music teacher, Malhar Kamat. Srikant Pandit tries to figure out why she had received inheritance from Kamat, many years after the music classes had ended, and subsequently makes a discovery. Astitva won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Marathi in the year 2000. Tabu's performance was highly acclaimed winning her several awards and is considered as one of her best. Plot Astitva encompasses issues such as male chauvinism, extramarital affairs, and spousal abuse. It is about a woman trying to find an identity outside her marriage. It is 1997. Malhar Kamat (played by Mohnish Bahl), an old musician and music teacher, is dying. He prepares his will where he leaves his entire jaydad (estate) -- comprising a haveli (mansion), of land, 1,400 grams of gold and approximately 800,000 rupees -- to Aditi Shrikant Pandit (Tabu). Upon his death two years later, the will is delivered to Aditi. When the will reaches Aditi in Pune, she is in the midst of an impromptu party occasioned by the arrival of Dr. Ravi Bapat (Ravindra Mankani) and his wife Meghna (Smita Jaykar). Ravi is a very close friend of Aditi's husband, Shrikant Pandit (Sachin Khedekar). Aditi and Shrikant's only child, Aniket (Sunil Barve) introduces his girlfriend and would-be wife Revati (Namrata Shirodkar) to everyone at the party. Shrikant opens the certified package that contains the will, even though it is addressed to Aditi, much to Meghna's chagrin and Ravi's surprise. Shrikant is intrigued and refers to his diaries from 25 years ago, in which he has chronicled events from his daily life. He realises that Aditi could not have possibly been pregnant from him at that time, because he was travelling on work. He shows her the diary, confronts her with the facts, and demands an explanation. In a flashback, Shrikant is an up-and-coming star at a firm, seeking to break out onto his own. His work keeps him traveling almost constantly. This leaves his newlywed wife Aditi lonely and frustrated. When she asks him to let her work someplace (clearly to relieve her boredom and find a good use for her time), he takes it as an insult and rebuffs her saying no woman in his family has ever worked outside the home and that he earns enough for them to live comfortably. He suggests (although not very enthusiastically) that she take up music. The music teacher is Malhar Kamat. Shrikant continues his unending travels all over the world, although he makes it clear to Malhar that music will not be anything more than a hobby for Aditi. Aditi's sister Sudha (Resham Tipnis) and her husband come to live with Aditi. Their constant lovemaking further deepens Aditi's feelings of yearning and abandonment. And one spring afternoon, as Malhar breaks into his new ghazal in the rain, Aditi's resolve is broken under the influence of the season. Malhar returns a couple of days later, and Aditi asks him to leave stating she loves only Shrikant. Aditi has missed a period. Sudha learns this and advises her to do something. When Shrikant returns, Aditi breaks down and tries to tell him the truth about her pregnancy. But Shrikant is doubly elated, having won the first major contract for his own firm and, hearing of his imminent fatherhood, and breaks out into celebrations without letting Aditi complete her story. As the story comes back to present time, Shrikant punishes Aditi by making her tell the truth in front of Aniket, Ravi and Meghna. Meghna loathes Shrikant, since she suffered spousal abuse from her drunkard husband before divorcing him and marrying Ravi. Aniket is disgusted with his mother after knowing the truth of his existence. Ravi confronts Shrikant stating Shrikant also committed sins many times if he thinks and states the one moment of weakness of Aditi as sin. Shrikant refuses to accept it stating he is a man and he doesn't bring any such child home. Shrikant decides that he will live with Aditi, but any spousal relationship between them will not exist. After Revati knows the truth, she breaks the engagement, not because of the truth, but because she realizes that Aniket is no different than the man whom he considered his father till now. Meghna decides to take Aditi to Goa with her, but Aditi declines. Before leaving the house, she demands her husband and son's presences to hear her. She states how her weakness is called sin, whereas Shrikant's weaknesses are accepted easily. She questions who has the authority to accept his weakness. And she reminds Shrikant the fact that they didn't have any other children, which might be due to Shrikant, but then she had always loved him in spite of bearing no child with him. And how she could have been made responsible for that too if she didn't have a child. Revati enters the house and gives her new generation views to Aniket stating he is alive as his mother didn't decide otherwise. Aditi walks out of the house with Revati. The movie ends with Revati and Aditi walking out the house and on the road, whilst Shri and Aniket stand in the doorway, watching them go. The denouement captures the essence of astitva. Production The role of lead actress was first offered to Madhuri Dixit, a leading lady of her times, when she rejected the offer, it went to Tabu, who received an important film of her acting career. The story is based on Guy de Maupassant's novel PIERRE AND JEAN which was also made into a movie Una Mujer Sin Amor (A Woman without Love) way back in 1952 in Spanish language.

Melville Beardsley was born in Kansas City, Missouri on 10 October 1913, to George and Ella Whitnel Beardsley. His father and grandfather Beardsley were attorneys. He was the third generation of his family to graduate from the University of Illinois, where he took a degree in mechanical engineering. From childhood he was fascinated with flight, and soon after college he joined the United States Army Air Corps as a pilot. By the time World War II broke out, he was one of the Army's few experienced pilots and spent the war years as a flight instructor at Hondo Field, Texas. The United States Army (and later United States Air Force which was created out of the Army's Air Corps) sponsored post-graduate education in aeronautics and management at Georgia Tech and the University of Chicago. He was USAF project officer for Northrup's famous flying wing. Beardsley's Early Years in ACV Development It's difficult to establish exactly when Mel Beardsley conceived the air-cushion vehicle, but he worked on a Navy hydrofoil project in southern California about 1950, and this was his first known involvement in marine vehicles. The air-cushion may have been a low-friction boat-hull solution, to which Beardsley added forced air as the missing element for the basic air- cushion vehicle. It is certain that Beardsley and the British inventor Cockerell conceived the air-cushion vehicle independently. It was not possible for them to have known of each other's work. One may say that \\"the idea was in the air\\" and inevitable. Beardsley's further personal research led to his patents of the early 1950s. After completing another 7 years of military service, Beardsley founded National Research Associates, Inc. (NRA) in College Park and Laurel, Maryland to build practical air-cushion vehicles. Beardsley's experiments led to the development of the skirt and peripheral air-flow, without which hovercraft are impractical. A patent dispute had developed in the early 1960s to determine who had first come up with the ACV-hovercraft concept, Cockerell or Beardsley. Ultimately Cockerell paid a settlement of $85,000 to Beardsley for his patent rights, equivalent to more than $1,000,000 in today's dollars, which made practical the famous Channel hovercraft. Beardsley Air Car Company and Skimmers, Inc. Mel Beardsley still had a briefcase full of designs. One of the prototypes NRA made was the \\"Little Skimmer.\\" It was a very basic solo ACV which could get up to 15 MPH. It was tricky to master, and took great balance! He established successively two companies in his home, Beardsley Air Car Company and Skimmers, Inc., and set out to see what market there was for sports model ACVs. Rather than add an extra engine and fan facing the rear, as in his earlier Aqua-GEM model, Beardsley conceived a single-engine, single-fan design which was a forerunner of all modern sports hovercraft. Later life Mel Beardsley worked from 1965 to 1976 with the Naval Ship Research and Development Center (NSRDC) near Annapolis, Maryland. The large air-cushion vehicles used today by the US military are largely a product of their design and testing. In his retirement he invented, tested, and patented the Beachbuilder system of beach erosion prevention. Beardsley died 26 November 1998.

Highlights of his scientific work are his famous Analytic Subgroup Theorem (1989) which bases on the Multiplicity Estimates on Group Varieties which he published in 1989, his proof of the abelian analogue of the famous Lindemann‚Äôs theorem (wrongly called Lindermann-Weierstrass Theorem), the result which disproved the squaring of the circle, the joint work with Gerd Faltings on the Schmidt's Subspace Theorem, the Isogeny Estimates for Abelian varieties proved jointly with David Masser which furnishes an alternative approach to the Mordell conjecture and the joint work with Alan Baker on linear forms in logarithms. His Analytic Subgroup Theorem is now a central result in transcendence theory. It says that the only algebraic points of an analytic subgroup A of a commutative algebraic group defined over \\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{Q}} are in an algebraic subgroup of A.

It is situated approximately south of Edinburgh city centre at the junction of Mayfield Road and West Mayfield. The building was designed by the renowned Scottish architect, Hippolyte Blanc and the main building work took place between 1875 and 1879. It is particularly renowned for the range and quality of its stained glass. An extensive internal renovation of the sanctuary was undertaken in 2009.  History  In the mid nineteenth century, the Edinburgh suburb of Newington with its dwellings, shops and businesses, was bounded on its south side by an old drove road (now East and West Mayfield) beyond which were the farms and fields of Mayfield. However, in 1870 Duncan McLaren of Newington House, a past Lord Provost of Edinburgh and MP, began feuing his Mayfield land and by the time of his death in 1886 it was almost wholly built over. It was against this background that Mayfield Free Church (as it was first called) was built. The site for the present church was selected in July 1876, and the main sanctuary was completed in 1879, the spire being added in 1894. From the start this was a broad church which rapidly became widely known as a preaching centre, so that over the 130 plus years of its existence it has been blessed with a distinguished line of much loved and erudite preachers as minister. A detailed account of its history and past ministers, can be found at the church website. Notable Ministers *Very Rev William J. G. McDonald DD (1924-2015) minister of the church from 1959 to 1992. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1989. He was a presenter of Thought for the Day on Radio Scotland for many years under the name of Bill McDonald. His daughter is the journalist and broadcaster Sheena McDonald. *Very Rev James A Whyte (1920 ‚Äì 1 2005) minister of the church 1954 to 1958. He later became Professor of Practical theology and Christian ethics at St Mary's College, the divinity faculty of the University of St Andrews. He served Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from 1988 to 1989.Who's Who 1969. London, UK: Adam and Charles Black. 1969. p. 3312.  Present  Today Mayfield Salisbury offers a variety of services of worship. As well as the sanctuary, the premises also include two halls and several other meeting rooms. Thus a wide range of clubs and groups meet there and the buildings provide a focus point for much that goes on in this part of south Edinburgh. Revd Scott S McKenna has been the minister at Mayfield Salisbury since 2000. From September to June, the church choir provides music for Sunday worship and additional services. The choir is made up of keen amateurs and a small group of choral scholars and is led by Walter Thomson.  Festivals  In recent years special autumn festivals have been held. In autumn 2010, there was a three-week Festival of Meditation and Prayer which included musical events, lectures, special services, and a pilgrimage. In the autumn of 2011, there was a Festival of Aging and Faith and in autumn 2012 a Festival of Science, Reason and Religion. More information may be found here. In 2013 there was a Year of Pilgrimage. It is also used as a venue during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.http://www.edinburghguide.com/venue/mayfieldsalisburychurch See also *List of Church of Scotland parishes References External links *Mayfield Salisbury Church Web Site *Church of Scotland Official Web Site Churches in Edinburgh Church of Scotland churches in Scotland Category B listed buildings in Edinburgh Listed churches in Scotland Hippolyte Blanc buildings Edinburgh Festival Fringe venues ","title":"Mayfield Salisbury Church"},{"id":"6429948","text":"Laupersdorf is a municipality in the district of Thal in the canton of Solothurn in Switzerland.

Murray was born in Frimley, Surrey, England, the eldest child of Captain Virginius Murray (1817-1861) and his wife Elizabeth Alicia, n√©e Poitier. He was brought to Australia in 1855 by his mother, three years after his father had migrated there. Murray was educated at Rev. T. P. Fenner's, (M.A.) private school at South Yarra, Melbourne. Murray left school in 1860, and worked on a cattle run near Avoca, Victoria and later had some success as a gold prospector. In April 1862 Murray joined the Geological Survey of Victoria, directed by Alfred Selwyn, as field assistant to Charles Smith Wilkinson. Murray had experience in Bacchus Marsh, Ballan, the Otway ranges, and many other districts. When the Geological Survey was terminated on economic grounds in 1869, Murray engaged in mining and mining surveying in the Ballarat district. He joined the government service again in 1871, and made geological surveys of the Bendigo and Ballarat goldfields. Murray did a lot of pioneering surveying in Gippsland much of which had not been explored; some of this was done with Alfred William Howitt. In 1881 Murray was appointed geological surveyor for the department of mines, Victoria, and remained until his resignation in 1897. He afterwards held appointments with various English mining companies and in his later years did a good deal of prospecting work. Murray died on 5 September 1925. He married twice and was survived by sons and daughters of both marriages. In 1887 he published a capable volume, Victoria: Geology and Physical Geography, and a large number of his reports and maps will be found listed in Bulletin No. 23 of the geological survey of Victoria, p. 33. He was a hard-working and able geologist, who did excellent exploring and pioneering geological work in Victoria and particularly in relation to mining country. Murray died in Caulfield, Melbourne, Victoria.

Thompson had a lasting achievement to thwart a plan for a nuclear power station on the long and sandy Druridge Bay, east of Widdrington in the county, one of the leading beaches of Northumberland. Early life Jack Thompson was the son of a clerk. After leaving Bothal School he worked at a local coal mine, completing his education at Ashington Mining College. He became an electrical engineer, and shift charge engineer at Ellington Colliery. Local politics Thompson was an undemonstrative leftwinger, described by one of the Conservative candidates he defeated as an \\"absolute gentleman\\" and became a party whip for seven years. He joined the Labour Party in 1960, and from 1965 was secretary/agent in his constituency. He was elected to Newbiggin council in 1970, and Wansbeck Council which incorporated it in 1974; the same year he became a county councillor. In 1978 he was elected leader of Northumberland County Council Labour group, and when the party took control in 1981 he became council leader, implementing many changes and increasing its effectiveness. Thompson saw the Druridge Bay project as a threat to the environment as well as to the coal industry, and was alarmed that a pressurised water reactor ‚Äî which he considered unsafe ‚Äî was under consideration by the Central Electricity Generating Board. He therefore persuaded the council to campaign against PWRs as such. It was 1987 before he secured a promise from Lord Marshall, chairman of the CEGB, that there would not be a PWR at Druridge Bay; even then he was unconvinced. National Politics When the Wansbeck constituency was created at the 1983 election George Grant, MP for Morpeth, had a better claim as Morpeth forms its largest town, but stood down through ill health: this prompted Thompson to a successful nomination, upon which he planned to resign as council leader if elected the new MP. He accomplished this on being elected with 47% of local support in a three-party contest, bolstered by sponsorship from the mineworkers‚Äô union. At Westminster, he co-sponsored the Commons motion against narcotic glue sniffing, a problem then growing in schools, attacked \\"diktats\\" from Whitehall which he said were destroying local government, and repeatedly criticised the Conservative government's \\"squeeze\\" on education funding. During the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) he argued that some pit closures were due to bad management. In November 1984 he joined MPs from the hard-left Left Campaign Group in a demonstration that forced suspension of the chamber's sitting, over deductions from supplementary benefit for striking miners‚Äô dependants. When the poll tax was first proposed, Thompson warned ministers that while the rating system was unfair, the community charge would be worse ‚Äî and uncollectable. Thompson's local government experience led to his appointment to the Education, Science and Arts Select Committee for two years from 1985. Before the 1987 election he told Margaret Thatcher her government was \\"totally ignorant\\" about the depressed economic situation in the north. He later critiqued the \\"absolute folly\\" of breaking up the electricity industry prior to privatisation, campaigned against a planned toxic waste plant at North Blyth, and criticised Northumbria's ambulance service for opting out of NHS control without consultation. In 1990 Neil Kinnock appointed Thompson as Labour's whip for the northern county MPs. In 1991 he told the Employment Secretary that his decision to put an extra ¬£120 million into training programmes meant little compared with ¬£1 billion taken out of the training budget over the previous three years. He retired from the Commons in 1997. ;International Committees From 1989, Thompson was a delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union. He chaired the Council's Fisheries subcommittee, and the WEU's rules and privileges committee. Personal life Jackie Milburn, a prized Newcastle United footballer, was a cousin. Jack Thompson married Margaret Clarke in 1952 with whom he had two children.

Curiously, this turned out to be his final first-class appearance because he was banned for life soon afterwards following allegations of match-fixing in an earlier game. Although he was a professional, Lambert played for the Gentlemen in the inaugural and second Gentlemen v Players matches in 1806. He and William Beldham were selected for the Players but, to try to balance the two teams, they were given men for the Gentlemen in the first match. In the second match, Beldham returned to the Players but Lambert was again a given man for the Gentlemen.CricketArchive - scorecard of inaugural Gentlemen v Players matchCricketArchive - scorecard of second Gentlemen v Players match Lambert played in a great many matches that were not first-class including numerous single wicket events. Indeed, he was outstanding in the latter form of the game. His first-class record from 1801 to 1817 has 64 matches. He played 114 innings (5 not out) and scored 3,014 runs at 27.65 with a highest score of 157 in the Sussex v Epsom game. He scored 4 centuries and 16 fifties. He was a strong fielder and an occasional wicket-keeper, taking 61 catches and 26 stumpings. Lambert's bowling analyses are incomplete and we only know of his bowled victims. He took 187 wickets (bowled only) and his best tally was 6 in one innings.

It lies south-east of Pateley Bridge on the east side of Nidderdale and has a recently rebuilt river bridge across the River Nidd. History Records about Glasshouses stretch as far back as 1386 and the name of the village is believed to have derived from the Old English Glas Hus, which translates as the place where glass was made. Whilst there is no firm evidence of this, it was believed that glass for Fountains Abbey was made here. In the 16th century, lead was mined to the west and transported to the hamlet of Wilsill (east of Glasshouses) for smelting and onward transportation. The old twine mill, on the banks of the Nidd, was constructed between 1812 and 1814. The mill was used to produce flax, then hemp and latterly, rope. Local rumour has it that the mill supplied rope to the White Star Line and most notably, Glasshouse rope was used on the Titanic. When the railway was opened in the valley, it was used to transport coal into the millworks to provide additional power other than that made by the waterwheel. In 1830, a milldam was built on the northern bank of the River Nidd and a millrace was added at the same time. The dam still exists and is capable of storing of water. The dam is not used to power a waterwheel anymore, but is used for recreational purposes; fishing, skating in winter and water sports in summer. The mill was built by the Metcalfe family, who sold the business in 1907 after financial trouble. The mill continued until 1972 when production ceased and it was occupied by numerous small businesses. In 2017, it was announced that the grade II listed building would be converted into housing. The Metcalfe family were also responsible for building the school in 1861. The building still stands and now operates as the village primary school. Glasshouses Community Primary School was rated as being 'Good' by Ofsted in January 2017. There is a public house, The Birch Tree Inn, on the main Harrogate to Pateley Bridge road just outside the village in the neighbouring hamlet of Wilsill. May day is celebrated every year with traditional May Pole dancing and the crowning of the 'May Queen' on the village green. Transport Glasshouses lies just east of Pateley Bridge. Both Glasshouses and Pateley Bridge are linked by the B6265 road which travels down the valley to meet the A61 road at Ripley. There is a regular bus service on the road between Harrogate and Pateley Bridge. Whilst the Nidd Valley Railway went right through the village, no station was built in Glasshouses. The mill and gas works complex shared a siding, primarily for the inward transportation of coal. The long distance walk, the Six Dales Trail, runs through the village.

Born in Bullaun, County Galway, Cooney first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St. Raphael's College. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Galway minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He made his senior debut during the 1983 championship. Cooney immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won two All-Ireland medals, three Connacht medals and three National Hurling League medals. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on four occasions. As a member of the Connacht inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Cooney won four Railway Cup medal. At club level he is a two-time All-Ireland medallist with Sarsfield's. In addition to this he has also won three Connacht medals and five championship medals. Cooney's brother, Jimmy, was also an All-Ireland medallist with Galway while his son, Joseph, also lined out with Galway. His career tally of 10 goals and 102 points ranks him as Galway's fifth highest championship scorer of all-time. Throughout his career Cooney made 35 championship appearances. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 24 January 2001. Cooney is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. During his playing days he won five All- Star awards in six seasons as well as being named Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1987. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport's greats, including at midfield on the Club Hurling Silver Jubilee Team and at centre- forward on the Galway Hurling Team of the Millennium and the Supreme All-Stars team. Cooney was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll. In May 2020, the Irish Independent named Cooney at number eleven in its \\"Top 20 hurlers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\". Early life Joe Cooney was born in Bullaun, County Galway in 1965. The tenth child in a family of fourteen, he was educated locally and he later St. Raphael's secondary school in Loughrea. Here his hurling skills came to the fore and he was quickly spotted by the Galway inter-county selectors. Personal life Joe's eldest son Joseph was a member of the successful Galway minor hurling team of 2009. He played at wing-back in that game. Joseph was also a member of the Galway under 21 panel of 2010, which lost the final to Tipperary. Joseph has also won an all-Ireland vocational school title with St. Brigids of Loughrea and is currently a member of the Galway senior panel. Playing career Club Cooney played his club hurling with his local Sarsfield's club and enjoyed much success. He first tasted success in 1984 when he won a county under-21 title. Five years later in 1989 Cooney captured his first senior county title before later winning a Connacht club title. In the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final Sarsfield's played Ballyhale Shamrocks. It was an unprecedented occasion as five Cooney brothers lined out against seven Fennelly brothers from Ballyhale. Unfortunately for Cooney it was the Fennellys who ended up on the winning side on that occasion. 1992 saw Cooney win a second county title. He later captured a second Connacht club title before lining out in his first All-Ireland club final against Kilmallock. The game was very close for much of the hour, however, with five minutes to go Cooney sent a long-range free into the net to secure an All-Ireland club medal for himself. Sarsfield's retained their county and provincial club titles in 1993 and Cooney later lined out in his second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again Cooney proved to be one of the heroes of the game. A sixty-fifth- minute goal, set up by Cooney, gave Sarsfield's the victory over Toomevara and gave Cooney his second All-Ireland club medal. Cooney added a fourth and a fifth county and Connacht club medal to his collection in 1995 and 1997. Inter-county Cooney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Galway minor hurling team in the early 1980s. He won an All-Ireland medal in this grade in 1983 after Galway defeated a Dublin team that contained a young Niall Quinn. Three years later in 1986 Cooney won an All-Ireland medal with the Galway under-21 team following a defeat of Wexford. By this stage Cooney was also lining out with the Galway senior hurling team. He made his debut in 1985 and lined out in his very first senior All-Ireland final. Offaly provided the opposition on the day and the game was a close and exciting one. Cooney scored a goal towards the end, however, it was disallowed. This might have turned the game for Galway; however, Offaly went on to win on a score line of 2-11 to 1-12. In spite of losing the game Cooney was later presented with his first All-Star award. In 1986 Cooney lined out in his second All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Galway were the red-hot favourites for the title. After an exciting game between the two sides Cork emerged victorious on a score line of 4-13 to 2-15. In spite of losing the championship decider for a second year in-a-row, Cooney's performance still earned him a second All-Star award. 1987 saw Cooney collect his first National Hurling League title before lining out in a third consecutive All-Ireland final. After a low-scoring game against Kilkenny Galway finally triumphed on a score line of 1-12 to 0-9 and Cooney collected his first senior All-Ireland medal. Once again he was presented with a third All-Star award. In 1988 Cooney made his fourth consecutive appearance in the championship decider with Tipperary lining out against his side. Noel Lane, the goal-scoring hero of the previous year's final once again scored at a crucial time, giving Galway the victory and giving Cooney a second consecutive All-Ireland medal. In 1989 Cooney won a second National League title and Galway looked a good bet to win a third championship in-a-row. Unfortunately, star centre-back Tony Keady was controversially suspended from playing for a year. This set the tone for Galway's championship campaign and they were later dumped out of the championship by Tipperary in an ill-tempered All-Ireland semi-final. In spite of losing out Cooney still collected a fourth All-Star award. In 1990 Cooney was appointed captain of the Galway team. That year his team reached a fifth championship decider in six seasons. Like 1986 Cork provided the opposition and, once again, Galway were regarded as the red-hot favourites. Cooney put in a brilliant performance in the first half and Galway went seven points up at one stage. In spite of this Cork fought back and won the game on a score line of 5-15 to 2-21. It was bitterly disappointing for Cooney; however, he was later presented with a fifth All-Star award. The following few years saw Galway's fortunes take a downturn.

Part of the state of Sikkim, Darjeeling became part of an important buffer state between Nepal and Bhutan. The British, using the area as a sanitorium, found that the climate provided excellent tea-cultivating conditions and soon began to grow tea on the hills of Darjeeling. Darjeeling tea remains a world-renowned export from Darjeeling. Early days the King of Sikkim, at Darjeeling, c. 1900. The etymology of the place comes from Dar-jyu-lyang meaning abode of the gods. It is said that it was formerly a place of worship of the Rongs where three stone stand erect (Lung-Chok) till today. Unfortunately the monastery was destroyed by the invading Gurkha Army in 1815. Darjeeling was originally a part of the Kingdom of Sikkim and was inhabited by the Lepchas, a tribe native to the area since the beginning of time, before being invaded by the Gorkhas who were able to subdue the combined indigenous Bhutia and Lepcha armies of Sikkim. The Gorkha army from Nepal invaded Darjeeling in the 1780s, attacked the Sikkimese capital of Rabdentse, and annexed territories up to the Teesta River into Nepal. By 1816 the whole of the area known as British Sikkim belonged to Nepal. After the Anglo-Gorkha War, Nepal ceded one-third of it territories to the British under the 1816 Sugauli Treaty, which included the land area between the Mechi and Teesta Rivers. On 10February 1817, the British returned the land area between the Mechi and Teesta to the Sikkimese Chogyal under the Treaty of Titalia. Migration of the Lepchas to Nepal took place after the assassination of Sikkimese Prime Minister Bolot, of the influential Lepcha Barfung clan. In 1826, Chogyal Tsugphud Namgyal (on the advice of his mother who was a Lepcha herself) passed a resolution for the assassination of his Prime Minister - Bolot. Bolot was the maternal uncle to Tsugphud Namgyal and his assassination was carried out by 'Lhachos' identified by Maharaja's history as the father of 'Cheebu Lama'. Bolot's nephews, the sons of Kotaba Kungha named Dathup, Jerung Denon and Kazi Gorok left Sikkim taking with them 800 houses of Lepcha subjects from Chidam and Namthang and went to Ilam in Nepal where their descendants still reside to this day. From here they conducted raids on Darjeeling and Sikkim Terai. This event was known as the Kotapa insurrection which was eventually suppressed through British East India Company's assistance. More than a fallout between the two ethnic groups, it was basically a race for the prized throne. After 1826 the royal family chose its consorts from the aristocracy of Tibet and not from among its Lepcha subjects as prior to that. East India Company Lease In February 1829 dispute between Nepal and Sikkim arose regarding their borders (especially Ontoo Dara) and the then British Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, sent two officers, Captain George Alymer Lloyd and J. W. Grant, to help resolve the situation. On the journey to Ontoo Dara the two officers stayed at Darjeeling for six days at \\"the old Goorka station called Dorjeling\\", which Lloyd noted was populated by \\"100 souls\\" of Lepchas, and were \\"much impressed with the possibility of the station as a sanatorium.\\" On 18June 1829, Lloyd communicated to the government regarding the possibility of Darjeeling serving as a sanatorium, while about the same time Grant also urged the government to acquire the tract. > \\"From a report dated the 18th June 1829, in which he claims to have been the > only European who ever visited the place, we learn that Lloyd visited the > old Goorka station called Dorjeling‚Äô for six days in February 1829 ... > Darjeeling itself, though formerly occupied by a large village and the > residence of one of the principal Kazis, was deserted, and the country round > it was sparsely inhabited ...

What little cultivation there was, had been abandoned.\\"Bengal > District Gazetteer By L.S.S O' Malley View of the Kangchenjunga peaks from Darjeeling Bentinck agreed to acquire the hill tract as a military outpost and sanatorium, acknowledging that it also offered strategic advantages as a military outpost and trading hub. Captain Herbert, the Deputy Surveyor General, was then sent to Darjeeling to examine the area. The court of Directors of the British East India Company approved the project. General Lloyd was given the responsibility to negotiate a lease of the area from the Chogyal of Sikkim. The lease as per the Deed of Grant was granted on 1February 1835 and runs as follows: This was an unconditional cession of what was then a worthless uninhabited mountain, but in 1841 the British government granted the Chogyal of Sikkim an allowance of Rs. 100,000 per annum as compensation, and raised the grant to Rs. 6,000 per annum in 1846. A Copy of The Deed of Grant written in Lepcha followed by its translation in Hindustani. (1835)India Office Library, London Establishing the sanitorium In 1835, a member of the Indian Medical Service, Archibald Campbell, was appointed as agent of the leased tract, and Lieutenant Napier (later Lord Napier of Magdala) set to work improving the area and laying the foundations of the hill station of Darjeeling. Dr. Campbell became the first superintendent of the sanitarium in 1839. A road connecting Darjeeling with the plains was con structed in 1839. Beginning of tea plantation Bringing in the Darjeeling tea harvest, circa 1890. Dr. Campbell brought Chinese tea seeds in 1841 from the Kumaon region and started growing tea on an experimental basis near his residence at Beechwood, Darjeeling. This experiment was followed by similar efforts by several other British. The experiments were successful and soon several tea estates started operating commercially. Annexation into the British Indian Empire Darjeeling, showing the Himalayan Range, as seen from St. Paul's School, Darjeeling, 1870 The rapid growth of Darjeeling led to jealousy from the Chogyal of Sikkim. There were also differences between the British Government and Sikkim over the status of people of Sikkim. Because of the increased importance of Darjeeling, many citizens of Sikkim, mostly of the labour class, started to settle in Darjeeling as British subjects. The migration disturbed the feudal lords in Sikkim who resorted to forcibly getting the migrants back to Sikkim. The relation deteriorated to such an extent that when Dr. Campbell and the eminent explorer Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker were touring in Sikkim in 1849, they were suddenly captured and imprisoned. This detention continued for weeks. An expeditionary force was sent by the Company to Sikkim. However, there was no necessity for bloodshed and after the Company's troops had crossed the Rangeet River into Sikkim, hostilities ceased. Consequent to this trouble, and further misconduct on the part of the Sikkim authorities a few years later, the mountain tracts now forming the district of Darjeeling became a part of the British Indian Empire, and the remainder of kingdom of Sikkim became a protected state. The area of Kalimpong along with the Dooars became British property following the defeat of Bhutan in the Anglo-Bhutan war (Treaty of Sinchula ‚Äì 11 November 1865). Kalimpong was first put under the Deputy Commissioner of Western Duars, but in 1866 it was transferred to the District of Darjeeling giving the district its final shape. Further development Himalayan Bird at the world's highest railway station The Loop, 'Agony Point', on Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, 1880s (Chowrasta) bandstand in 1880. The Darjeeling Municipality was established in 1850. Tea estates continued to grow. By the 1860s, peace was restored in the borders. During this time, immigrants, mainly from Nepal, were recruited to work in the construction sites, tea gardens, and other agriculture-related projects. Scottish missionaries undertook the construction of schools and welfare centres for the British residents: Loreto Convent in 1847, St. Paul's School in 1864, Planters' Club in 1868, Lloyd's Botanical Garden in 1878, St. Joseph's School in 1888, Railway Station in 1891, and Town Hall (present Municipality Building) in 1921. With the opening of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway in 1881, smooth communication between the town and the plains below further increased the development of the region. \\"Darjeeling disaster\\" was an earthquake in 1898 that caused considerable damage to the young town and its native population. Administration Darjeeling Municipality took responsibility in maintaining the civic administration of the town from as early as 1850. From 1850 to 1916, the Municipality was placed in the first schedule (along with Halna, Hazaribagh, Muzzaferpur and others), where commissioners were appointed by the local governments and second schedule (along with Burdwan, Hooghly, Nadia, Hazaribagh and others), where the local government appointed a chairman. Prior to 1861 and from 1870‚Äì1874, Darjeeling District was a \\"Non-Regulated Area\\" (where acts and regulations of the British Raj did not automatically apply in the district in line with rest of the country, unless specifically extended). From 1862 to 1870, it was considered a \\"Regulated Area\\". The term \\"Non-Regulated Area\\" was changed to \\"Scheduled District\\" in 1874 and again to \\"Back Ward Tracts\\" in 1919. The status was known as \\"Partially Excluded Area\\" from 1935 until the independence of India. Development as a tourist destination Darjeeling's elite residents were the British ruling class of the time, who visited Darjeeling every summer. An increasing number of well-to-do Indian residents of Kolkata (then Calcutta), affluent Maharajas of princely states, land-owning zamindars and barristers of Calcutta High Court also began visiting Darjeeling. The town continued to grow as a tourist destination, becoming known as the \\"Queen of the Hills\\". The town did not see any significant political activity during the freedom struggle of India owing to its remote location and small population. However, there was a failed assassination attempt by revolutionaries on Sir John Anderson, the Governor of Bengal in the 1930s. After independence of India After the independence of India in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with the state of West Bengal. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hilly towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and the Terai areas of Siliguri. When the People's Liberation Army annexed Tibet in 1950, thousands of Tibetan refugees settled across Darjeeling district. The population of Darjeeling rose by leaps and bounds. The colonial town of Darjeeling was designed for a population of only 10,000. The population spurt has made the town more prone to the environmental problems in the recent decades as the region is geologically relatively new. The rise in tourism also affected the ecological balance of the area. A diverse ethnic population gave rise to socio-economic tensions, and the demand for the creation of the separate states of Gorkhaland and Kamtapur along ethnic lines grew popular in the 1980s. The issues came to a head after a 40-day strike called by the Gorkha National Liberation Front, during which violence gripped Darjeeling. Political tensions largely declined with the establishment of Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council under the chairmanship of Subhash Ghisingh. The DGHC was given semi- autonomous powers to govern the district. The issue of a separate state still agitated in between with a new political party Gorkha Janmukti Morcha demanding for separate state . The new party accepted the GTA (Gorkha Territorial Administration) after certain years from both the center and the state Government of West Bengal which it believes that the demarcation of land including the Tarai and Doors with Darjeeling and Kalimpong district are formed for better administrative purpose .

Typically this consists of surgically migrating the index finger to the position of the thumb in patients who are either born without a functional thumb (most common) or in patients who have lost their thumb traumatically and are not amenable to other preferred methods of thumb reconstruction such as toe-to-hand transfers.Dieter Buck-Gramcko: Pollizisation des Zeigefingers bei Aplasie und Hypoplasie des Daumens: Indikation, Technik und Ergebnis; Hamburg 1971Hildegunde Piza-Katzer, Andrea Wenger, Eva-Maria Baur, Dunja Estermann, and Michael Rieger: Pollicization of the index finger in hypoplasia of the thumb. Experience with the method of Buck-Gramcko and retrospective analysis of the clinical outcome in a series of 19 pollicizations; in: Journal of Hand and Microsurgery, Ausgabe 1/2009, p.17‚Äì24 During pollicization the index finger metacarpal bone is cut and the finger is rotated approximately 120 to 160 degrees and replaced at the base of the hand at the usual position of the thumb. The arteries and veins are left attached. If nerves and tendons are available from the previous thumb these are attached to provide sensation and movement to the new thumb (\\"neopollex\\"). If the thumb is congenitally absent other tendons from the migrated index finger may be shortened and rerouted to provide good movement. The presence of an opposable thumb is considered important for manipulation of most objects in the physical world. Children born without thumbs often adapt to the condition very well with few limitations therefore the decision to proceed with pollicization lies with the child's parents with the recommendation of their surgeon. Persons who have grown to adulthood with functional thumbs and then lost a thumb find it highly beneficial to have a thumb reconstruction, not only from a functional but from a mental and emotional standpoint. Other cases for pollicization are: * Where someone is born with a hand which has five fingers, but the radialmost finger is an ordinary finger and not a thumb.The Hand and Reconstructive Microsurgery Program at Children's Hospital of Boston\\"Boy has thumbs built from fingers\\". BBC News, February 25, 2005. * Floating thumb: this congenital defect is a hypoplastic thumb without its metacarpal and without the muscles needed to operate it. Surgical experience shows that it is best to fillet its bones out and use its skin as spare skin to line the cleft when pollicizing the index finger. *: (Attempt to salvage a floating thumb include transferring the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle as a thumb flexor, and making a thumb metacarpal out of a metatarsal bone taken from a foot; but this leaves an inadequate thumb, and a wrist weakness, and foot damage.) * There has been at least one case of pollicizing the little finger.

It was written by Edward Anhalt from a novel by Evan Hunter. The supporting cast includes Dina Merrill, Shelley Winters, and Edward Andrews, and The Young Savages was the first film featuring Telly Savalas, who plays a police detective, foreshadowing his later role as Kojak. Often categorized as a \\"thinking man's movie\\", it has received mixed reviews. Plot Two Italian-American greasers, Danny DiPace (Stanley Kristien) and Anthony \\"Batman\\" Aposto (Neil Nephew), and the Irish-American Arthur Reardon (John Davis Chandler) are members of a street gang named the Thunderbirds in New York City in East Harlem. They have an ongoing turf war with a Puerto Rican gang called the Horsemen. The three Thunderbirds unleash a knife attack on Roberto Escalante (Jos√© P√©rez), a blind member of the Horsemen and stab him to death. They are caught and arrested, and during questioning by the police, assistant district attorney Hank Bell (Burt Lancaster) discovers one of the boys is the son of Mary diPace (Shelley Winters), an ex-girlfriend. Back at the office of the district attorney Dan Cole (Edward Andrews), Bell admits he knows the mother of one of the suspects in the killing. Despite objections, he is not taken off the case and admits that he grew up in the same neighborhood. In a conversation with his wife Karin (Dina Merrill), Bell admits that his father changed his name from Bellini (Belani in the book) to Bell because he wanted to conceal his background and where he grew up, a deception Bell had found advantageous in pursuing his career and marrying a Vassar girl. At the funeral for Roberto Escalante, Bell is confronted by his ex-lover who tells him that her son promised he would never join a gang. Bell then sets out to find the facts about the killing, meeting one by one with all the families and gang members involved. He learns not only the intricacies of the case, but is shocked at his own capacity to kill when he is attacked by a gang, making him realize his hard-won character in the school of hard knocks is not immune to these forces. From a different angle, illustrating the limitations of a privileged education and upbringing, his wife finds her idealistic empathy for those caught in a web of circumstance is challenged when she is attacked by gang members in an elevator. The drama evolves to consider many aspects of the crime: gangs, poverty, ethnic bias, parental incapacity to deal with forces far beyond their control, and politics. The three boys tried for the murder illustrate how personal qualities of morality, mental capacity, conformity, and psychosis fit into a squalid ethnically diverse setting compartmentalized by demeaning stereotypical beliefs. The milieu in which all life is on trial, including not only the perpetrators' surroundings, but the failure of larger society to take much interest in the underlying issues. When the trial concludes with different sentences for each boy tailored to their natures, the mother of the victim asks Hank Bell accusingly if justice had been served, and Bell answers unhappily that a great many people bear a responsibility for her son's death.

The film was written by Richard Sherman, Fred F. Finklehoffe and Sid Silvers, based on a story by Howard Emmett Rogers inspired by a true story about vaudeville actors Harry Palmer and Jo Hayden, when Palmer was drafted into World War I. The film was a production of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. Plot In the heyday of vaudeville, on the verge of America's entrance into World War I, two talented performers, Jo Hayden (Judy Garland) and Harry Palmer (Gene Kelly), set their sights on playing the Palace Theatre on Broadway, the epitome of vaudeville success, and marrying immediately after. Just weeks before their plans are to be realized Harry gets a draft notice. Intending to obtain a short delay before reporting for duty, he intentionally smashes his hand in a trunk. That same day Jo is notified that her brother, who had been studying to be a doctor, has died in the war. When she realizes what Harry has done, she rejects him and leaves the act. Harry then tries to undo his rash act and enlist, but none of the armed services will take him as his hand has been permanently crippled. Eventually he resigns himself to participating in the war effort the only way left open to him, entertaining front line troops for the YMCA. When he and his partner find themselves dangerously close to the front, Harry heroically sets out to warn off an ambulance convoy heading into an artillery bombardment. He is wounded while destroying an enemy machine gun emplacement ambushing the convoy and is apparently commended for his bravery. After the war, during a victory performance at the Palace Theatre, Jo sees Harry in the audience and runs to him. The two reunite on stage to sing \\"For Me and My Gal\\", the first song they ever performed together. Cast *Judy Garland as Jo Hayden *Gene Kelly as Harry Palmer *George Murphy as Jimmy K.

Adler also suggested Gene Kelly for the lead. Kelly was 29 years old at the time, and had made a mark on Broadway as the star of Pal Joey and the choreographer of Best Foot Forward.IBDB Gene Kelly When David O. Selznick signed him to a film contract, Kelly's intention was to return to Broadway after fulfilling his contractual obligation, but he ended up staying in Hollywood for a year because Selznick didn't have a role for him. When Arthur Freed inquired about getting Kelly for For Me and My Gal, Selznick handed over the contract, and Kelly got the part, over the objections of Freed's bosses at MGM.IMDb Biography for Gene Kelly The casting of Kelly meant that George Murphy, who was originally going to play \\"Harry Palmer\\", was switched to playing \\"Jimmy Metcalf\\". Gene Kelly and Judy Garland got along well - she had been in favor of his getting the part, and during shooting she helped Kelly adjust his stage acting for films, and backed him in disagreements with director Busby Berkeley, whom she did not like. Kelly and Garland went on to star together in two other films, The Pirate (1948) and Summer Stock (1950).Garland and Kelly both also appeared in 1946's Ziegfeld Follies, but not together. The film was also the American motion picture debut of Hungarian singer Martha Eggerth, who had appeared in over thirty films in Germany. Her career in Hollywood did not last long: she appeared in only two other American films.IMDb Martha Eggerth For Me and My Gal had an estimated budget of $803,000, and was in production at MGM's Culver City studios from 3 April until 23 May 1942, with additional scenes shot in June. Working titles for the film while it was in production were \\"Me and My Gal\\" and \\"The Big Time\\". When the film was initially previewed, the audience was dissatisfied with the ending: they thought that Jo (Garland) should end up with Jimmy (Murphy) rather than Harry (Kelly). This prompted Louis B. Mayer to order three weeks of additional shooting to give Kelly's character more of a conscience and to reduce Murphy's presence in the film. Release and reception For Me and My Gal premiered in New York on 21 October 1942, and opened in Los Angeles on 26 November 1942. It grossed $4,371,000 (consisting of $2,894,000 in the US and Canada and $1,477,000 elsewhere), making it one of the big hits of the year.Frank Miller \\"For Me and My Gal\\" TCM article\\"101 Pix Gross in Millions\\" Variety 6 Jan 1943 p 58 The studio earned a profit of $2,098,000.

Gardens' Bulletin, Straits Settlements 5 (Index): 3. Citrus glauca.Citrus pages, Native Australian Citrus, Citrus glauca Taxonomy Under the Swingle system, the desert lime was classified in the genus Eremocitrus, a close relative of the genus Citrus. More recent taxonomy considers all the Australian limes to be included in the genus Citrus, and most authorities treat the desert lime this way. Citrus glauca is one of the most resilient Citrus species, and is comparatively heat, drought, and cold tolerant. Hence the species is potentially important for Citrus breeding programs, and readily hybridises with many common Citrus species. The Australian Outback Lime Description A shrub or small tree to 12 metres it has several unusual characteristics. It is cold, heat, drought and salinity tolerant and thought evergreen, if the rains should fail it will shed its leaves and live off the green bark on the plant branches. It will set fruit almost immediately after flowering and is the earliest citrus to do so. Fruit is small and variable and depends on current climatic conditions and genetic make-up. Thorns appear on low growing branches to prevent grazing by rabbits, kangaroos, cattle etc but cease on branches above the grazing level. The fruit is small with an intense piquant flavour and good rainfall years produce an abundance of fruit. Economic uses Citrus glauca in the wild The desert lime fruit is a highly prized bushfood. Traditionally, it is wild-harvested from surviving bushland areas, where it is relatively common. However, C. glauca has also been extensively cleared from some areas due to the ongoing conversion of the wild bush into agricultural fields.Cherikoff, Vic, The Bushfood Handbook, .Low, Tim, Wild Food Plants of Australia, . The fruit are used in a range of products, including marmalades, beverages, and succade. It has a strong lime-like flavour.Cherikoff, Vic, Uniquely Australian, . The fruit is beginning to be domesticated. Commercial cultivation of this fruit is beginning to reduce the reliance on wild-harvested product. Taxonomy, cultivars, and hybrids =Australian outback lime= The Australian Outback Lime was selected by CSIRO scientists from the regular desert lime. It is characterised by its upright habit, relatively large, flavoursome fruit, high yield, uniform ripening time, lack of thorns, and suitability for mechanical harvesting. The Australian Outback Lime was cultivated at the former CSIRO Plant Industry site at Merbein, Victoria by Dr. Steve Sykes. =Hybrids= The eremolemon The eremolemon is thought to be a Citrus glauca √ó Citrus meyeri hybrid. It grows quickly and tolerates saline soil. Citrus plants hybridise readily. The eremolemon is thought to be a natural true- breeding cross between the desert lime and the Meyer lemon. Other hybrids include eremoranges, eremoradias (hybrid with a sour orange) and citrangeremos (hybrid with a citrange).

When he got off the plane in Miami, a new life began. (Thirteen years later, the mayor of Miami would be handing him the key to the city and proclaiming John Uelses Day.) When he arrived in the U.S. he spoke no English and his education had been hindered by the war, so he was placed in 4th grade. He studied every night and practiced his English as much as possible, and soon caught with his age group. His great-aunt and uncle eventually adopted him. His name became John Hans Uelses and he became a citizen of the United States of America.Archives ‚Äì Philly.com. Articles.philly.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2017.  Career  Uelses went to Miami Senior High School where they had an outstanding athletic program. An all-around athlete, he was a star hurdler and high jumper and ran the 440 on track team and played on the football team while also an honor student. When he injured an ankle on the hurdles, someone suggested he try pole vaulting. He did, and was soon obsessed. He asked his adoptive father to help him build a vaulting pit in the backyard. He spent hours training and hanging by ropes from trees. He received most valuable track athlete his junior year in high school. Upon graduation he received a scholarship to the University of Alabama. There he set university records and won Southeastern Conference titles in pole vault, javelin, and hurdles. It was the time of Bear Bryant and football was king. Uelses longed for big meets and competition. While competing for the track team at Alabama, he heard about a U.S. Marine track and field program where he could compete in large national and international events. The Marines delivered on their promise: soon he was at Quantico training for the Marines and the competition he was seeking. He told a reporter he might be the only Marine who looked forward to boot camp. Uelses, one of the first vaulters to jump on a fiberglass pole, made this new style of vaulting the standard for future vaulters. His historic jump at the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden made headlines around the world and landed him on the February 26, 1962 cover of Sports Illustrated. The article inside headlined \\"He Could Do It on Bamboo.\\" Some purists complained that the fiberglass pole was an acrobatic circus stunt, and called the pole a gimmick. Sports Illustrated decided to put poles to the test using fiberglass, steel, bamboo and aluminum. They concluded that fiberglass and bamboo were the most efficient pole materials, but that athletic concentration, speed, skill and style were what made the records. At the time of his first record-breaking jumps, Uelses was a corporal in the U.S. Marines stationed in Quantico, Virginia. He was also a member of the U.S. track team, traveling and competing all over world. He vaulted and won medals in Brussels, Russia, Poland, Finland, Japan, Germany, and England. In 1961 he won the World Military Outdoor Championship in Brussels. He was part of the infamous USA vs USSR cold war matches. His first place win in 1963 in Moscow, despite an injury, was particularly satisfying to him. He also was selected to participate in a goodwill exhibition tour of Africa sponsored by the State Department. Uelses learned the art of bending the fiberglass pole at Quantico from Aubrey Dooley. Uelses had a unique style of vaulting with a shorter run up than most other vaulters. Dooley attributed Uelses's short run up to his speed: he could reach his top-end speed in that shorter distance. In another unique move, Uelses would bend his pole backward, away from the pit. But it was his determination that was most significant. John Uelses pole vaulting, 1964. Photo by Harold E. Edgerton, MIT. After his tour with the Marines, Uelses received a scholarship to La Salle University in Philadelphia. He was a member of the Explorer track team. He won the NCAA pole vault championship in 1964 with an American Indoor Record of 16 4 1/2 \\", as well as three IC4A championships and two MAC championships. He was an NCAA All American. Uelses also played soccer at La Salle. Upon graduating from La Salle, Uelses served as a United States Naval Officer and aviator. After completing flight training, he served as a member of the F-4 Phantom Fighter squadrons and instructor at training commands. He was selected for the first F14 Tomcat Fighter Squadron VF-1 stationed in California. Uelses' fighter squadrons were on the USS Ranger and the USS Enterprise. After graduating from Naval War College in Newport, he was stationed with US European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, and Naval Air Systems Command in Washington DC. After retiring, Uelses and his wife returned to California to be close to their family. He continued his love of track and vaulting by serving as vaulting coach in high schools until 2008.

He is formerly the manager of Shelbourne in the League of Ireland First Division, the club with which he spent most of his playing career. Playing career He made his League of Ireland debut for Kilkenny City at Bray Wanderers on 21 November 1993. After one season at Buckley Park he moved home to Home Farm where in 4 seasons he won the First Division Shield. He won five league titles and one FAI Cup with Shelbourne after making his debut against Finn Harps at Tolka Park in September 1998. He accompanied Dermot Keely, his former manager at Home Farm (whom Heary had captained) to Shelbourne. Heary, a right-sided full-back noted for his robust tackling, general fitness and frequent sorties up the right flank in support of his attack, was elected Player of the Year for the 2001/2002 season by his peers in the Professional Footballers' Association of Ireland. Heary was unveiled as a Bohemians player at a press conference on 22 January 2007 and has since slotted into the side with ease, playing a huge part in Bohs' great defensive record. Owen captained Bohs to the 2008 league title and FAI Cup in a fantastic season for the right back. He collected a bucketful of personal honours during the season, being voted on to the Eircom League of Ireland Premier Division Team for 2008, receiving 42% of the votes for the right back position and named the eircom/Soccer Writers Association of Ireland (SWAI) player of the month for October . This was topped off when he was named the SWAI Personality of the Year on 4 December. Heary struggled with injuries during the 2009 season, only making 20 league appearances.. However, he collected his first ever League Cup winners medal in the September as Bohs beat Waterford United 3‚Äì1 at the RSC.Bohs win EA Sports League Cup In November 2009, Heary as captain, collected the Premier Division trophy for the Bohemians first back-to-back league wins. In doing so, he equalled Johnny Matthews record of 7 league winners medals. Despite captaining the club to the Setanta Sports Cup,Bohemians win Setanta Cup Bohemians had a disappointing 2010 season where the club lost their league title on goal difference and failed to make an impact in Europe where they made an embarrassing exit to Welsh side The New Saints. Heary retired as a player in 2013. His testimonial was played between Shels and Bohs at Dalymount Park in November 2013. Management Owen took his first steps into management during 2011 when he took charge of Bohs' A Team and under 19 team and also managed the first team during their Leinster Senior Cup matches. When Pat Fenlon departed for Hibernian, Owen became Aaron Callaghan's assistant manager for the 2012 season.Heary becomes number 2 to Callaghan After a poor run of results during the 2013 season which left Bohs in the relegation zone, Callaghan was sacked as manager and Heary was appointed to take caretaker charge of the club. Due to Heary not possessing the necessary coaching qualifications, this was for an initial 60-day period until 12 September 2013.Heary takes charge of Bohemians Heary now holds a UEFA Pro Licence having been shortlisted by the FAI to do the course in January 2014. Heary managed Sligo Rovers until June 2015. He was appointed as manager of Shelbourne on 28 June 2016 following Kevin Doherty's resignation.

The work was Nabokov's final published novel before his death in 1977. Plot summary Look at the Harlequins! is a fictional autobiography narrated by Vadim Vadimovich N. (VV), a Russian-American writer with uncanny biographical likenesses to the novel's author, Vladimir (Vladimirovich) Nabokov. VV is born in pre-revolutionary St. Petersburg and raised by his aunt, who advises him to \\"look at the harlequins\\" \\"Play! Invent the world! Invent reality!\\". After the revolution, VV moves to Western Europe. Count Nikifor Nikodimovich Starov becomes his patron (is he VV's father?). VV meets Iris Black who becomes his first wife. After her death‚Äîshe is killed by a Russian √©migr√©‚Äîhe marries Annette (Anna Ivanovna Blagovo), his long-necked typist. They have a daughter, Isabel, and emigrate to the United States. The marriage fails; and, after Annette's death, VV takes care of the pubescent Isabel, now known as Bel. They travel from motel to motel. To counter ugly rumors, VV marries Louise Adamson while Bel elopes with an American to Soviet Russia. After the third marriage fails, VV marries again, a Bel lookalike (same birthdate, too), referred to as \\"you\\", his final love. VV is an unreliable narrator who gives conflicting information (e.g., on the death of his father) and seems to suffer from some psychological affliction. When making a full turn while walking‚Äîmentally, that is‚Äîand tracing his steps back, he is unable to execute the reversion of the surrounding vista in his imagination. He also has the notion that he is a double of another Nabokovian persona. Criticism Doppelg√§nger vs. parody Literary criticism has weighed in on both sides of this debate, some even claiming that Vadim is both a parody and a double or Doppelg√§nger of Nabokov. For example, Nabokov's Lolita is acted out by the narrator of Look at the Harlequins! through his fondling of the nymphet, Dolly von Borg. The attribution of a string of wives to the narrator may be understood in the context of Nabokov's strictly monogamous life. After the publication of Lolita the wider public and many critics thought that its author must be a \\"sexual daredevil\\". With the serial polygamy related in Look At The Harlequins!, Nabokov can be seen to be poking fun at these perceptions. V.V.'s final wife is simply addressed as \\"You\\", which parallels Nabokov's addressing his wife, V√©ra, simply as \\"you\\" in his autobiography Speak, Memory. The fact that the final object of V.V.'s love is a perfect image of V.V.'s daughter, \\"Bel,\\" parallels the search by Humbert Humbert, the main character of Lolita, for a girl-child just like \\"Annabel\\", his first love when he himself was aged 12. If V.V. is afflicted by feelings of being the double of another Nabokovian persona, this is because he bears in fact significant resemblances to the main character of the novel The Real Life of Sebastian Knight from 1941. Herbert Grabes is among the critics who believe that Vadim is Nabokov's ‚Äúparodic double‚Äù (151). Pekka Tammi agrees: ‚Äúany fictive [narrator] can be, even at best, only a ‚Äòparody‚Äô of the artist who is responsible for the ultimate fiction‚Äù (289). Lucy Maddox calls Look at the Harlequins! ‚Äúan oblique, satiric self-portrait‚Äù (144). In Speak, Memory, Nabokov had written that much of his own life had appeared in his fictional works in the past, and that he felt as though he had lost these memories as they were crystallized into text, abstracted into fictions. His thoughts on the inevitably autobiographical nature of fiction seem to manifest, playfully, here. Biographical reading of the novel One popular explanation for Vadim's personal and literary similarity to Nabokov is that Vadim is a parody of bungled biographical renderings of the author. The composition of Look at the Harlequins! followed on the heels of Andrew Field‚Äôs biography Nabokov: His Life in Part, a biography that eventually resulted in the termination of Nabokov‚Äôs relations with Field and in the novelist‚Äôs failed attempt at legal suppression of the biography. Nabokov felt that Field had created a character named Vladimir Nabokov in his biography‚Äîa character whom the real author could not recognize (Johnson, 330). Nabokov ‚Äúhad already perfected the role of his own biographer‚Äîin a series of mock biographies that began with a game he invented in adolescence, and that continued in his memoir Speak, Memory (1966) and his fiction. The encounter with Field, his first real-life biographer, produced. . .[the] parodic text. . .Look at the Harlequins! (1974). . .‚Äù (Sweeney 295-6). The book begins with a list of \\"Other Books by the Narrator\\" (that is, Vadim rather than Vladimir Nabokov).

He was a prolific goalscorer in the League of Ireland Premier Division and has represented the Republic of Ireland national football team on two occasions. Crowe previously played for Wolves, Bohemians, Shelbourne and Sporting Fingal.  Family  Glen Crowe's grandad is Liam Crowe, who played football for the Irish Army, including a match against the Republic of Ireland national football team on 23 April 1944. Liam Crowe also played for Shamrock Rovers and won the FAI Cup in 1944. He also played for Shelbourne, St Patrick's Athletic, Dundalk and St James's Gate. Club career Wolverhampton Wanderers Crowe began his career with local Irish side St Mochta's, joining the youth setup at the age of 7. Stella Maris showed an interest in Crowe for several years and he eventually signed for the club and played in the Dublin & District Schoolboy League. At the age of 17, Crowe spent time on trial with Division One side Wolverhampton Wanderers, attending three separate trials with the club before being offered a one-year YTS contract. He spent the majority of his first season at Molineux in the youth team but was handed his professional debut on 30 April 1996 as a substitute during a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Reading. In the following match, the final game of the 1995‚Äì96 season, Crowe started his first match for Wolves against Charlton Athletic in May 1996 and scored his side's only goal during a 1‚Äì1 draw. He had loan spells at Cardiff City, Exeter City and Plymouth Argyle. Bohemians and Shelbourne Crowe returned to Dublin to join Bohemians, managed by Roddy Collins, in pre-season 1999. After scoring on his League of Ireland debut on 19 September 1999 in a 3‚Äì1 loss to Shamrock Rovers , Crowe ended up as top scorer for Bohemians in his first season with 9 league goals. The following season (2000/01), Glen formed a potent partnership with new-signing Trevor Molloy and broke the League goal-scoring record by hitting 25 league goals (35 in all competitions) as Bohemians won their first league title since 1978 and their first league and FAI Cup double since 1928. He also scored in Bohemians' UEFA Cup run, both home and away against 1. FC Kaiserslautern. This form led Mick McCarthy to call him into the international squad in the summer of 2001 for the World Cup qualifiers against Portugal and Estonia. Crowe once again starred as Bohemians won their 2nd league title in 3 years in 2003, but left the team for Dublin rivals Shelbourne in a controversial move in December 2004 where he formed a successful partnership with Jason Byrne. He claimed his third league winning medal in November 2006, ironically scoring the winning goal against his old club Bohemians to clinch Shelbourne's third title in four seasons.

The bird is 30‚Äì38 cm in size, with a 76‚Äì89 cm wingspan. Formerly considered a subspecies of the Manx shearwater, its actual relationships are unresolved. This species is pelagic, occurring in the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California. It comes closer to land than most other shearwaters, so it sometimes can be seen from shore.E.g. \\"thousands upon thousands\\" of birds seen off San Quint√≠n, Baja California at the end of June: Thayer & Bangs (1908) It predominantly nests on offshore islands off north and western Baja California, namely Isla de Guadalupe, Islas San Benito and Isla Natividad. It is fairly common off the United States coast of central and southern California during the country's colder months. The black-vented shearwater is thought to feed on mainly small fish. This bird nests in burrows and caves; it is a colonial nester. In the past, this bird had been threatened by feral cats and other predators on its breeding islands, but the problem seems to have been largely eliminated. There is some loss of birds from commercial gill netting, and the species is classified as near threatened by the IUCN mainly due to the uncertain impact on it by the expanding fishing industry.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos (‚Äì), Philadelphia Phillies (1977‚Äì), Chicago Cubs (‚Äì), and New York Yankees (1981‚Äì). Although he was highly regarded as a younger player, he suffered numerous injuries and played most of his baseball career as a reserve player. Major League career  Foote was born in Smithfield, North Carolina where he attended Smithfield-Selma High School. He was drafted by the Montreal Expos as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft held on June 4, . While playing for the Expos' minor league affiliate, the Quebec Carnavals in , Foote was selected as the catcher for the Eastern League All-Star team. Foote made his major league debut with the Expos on September 14, 1973 at the age of 21. He was highly regarded as a rookie by then-Expos manager Gene Mauch, who called him, \\"The next Johnny Bench\\". Foote replaced John Boccabella as the Expos catcher in 1974, and seemed to bear out Mauch's prediction for greatness, when he hit for a .262 batting average along with 11 home runs, 60 runs batted in, a .414 slugging percentage and a league- leading 12 sacrifice flies in 125 games. He also led National League catchers with 83 assists. Foote was named to the Topps All-Star Rookie Team. As a measure of how highly regarded Foote was as a catcher, in 1975, the Expos shifted future Hall of Fame catcher Gary Carter to right field. Foote's performance suffered in his sophomore year of 1975, as his batting average fell dramatically to .195 in 118 games. In September, Foote suffered a torn cartilage and underwent knee surgery after the season ended. In 1976, he split catching duties with Gary Carter and by the 1977 season, Carter had replaced Foote as the Expos' starting catcher. On June 15, 1977, the Expos traded Foote along with Dan Warthen to the Philadelphia Phillies for Wayne Twitchell and Tim Blackwell. Foote served as the Phillies back up catcher behind Bob Boone and Tim McCarver as they went on to win the 1978 National League Eastern Division title before losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1978 National League Championship Series. He appeared in only one game of the series as a pinch hitter, striking out in his only at bat. Foote was then traded to the Chicago Cubs for catcher Dave Rader in 1979. The Cubs immediately made Foote their starting catcher. He was the Cubs' catcher in a memorable game at Wrigley Field on May 17, when his former team, the Phillies, defeated the Cubs by a score of 23 to 22. He ended the 1979 season having played in a career- high 132 games and hit 16 home runs, also a career high. On April 22, 1980, during a game against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field, Foote had eight runs batted in, including a game-winning grand slam home run. A back injury curtailed Foote's playing time in 1980 and, he appeared in only 63 games. The New York Yankees traded Tom Filer for Foote on April 27, 1981 to fill the gap left by injured catcher, Rick Cerone. Foote hit a home run in his first at bat for the Yankees and hit five home runs in his first seven games with the team. The season was then halted when the Major League Baseball Players Association voted unanimously to strike on May 29. The season resumed on August 9 after the All-Star game, but Foote was used sparingly for the remainder of the season. He played in the 1981 World Series for the Yankees, but struck out in his only at-bat. Foote went on the injured reserve list in June 1982 after suffering back spasms. He was assigned to the Columbus Clippers in July 1982 to make room on the roster when Rick Cerone returned from an injury. Foote played in his final major league game on August 8, 1982 at the age of 30. On March 25, 1983, he was released by the New York Yankees on the last day of spring training. Career statistics In a ten-year major league career, Foote played in 687 games, accumulating 489 hits in 2,127 at bats for a .230 career batting average along with 57 home runs and 230 runs batted in. As a catcher, he had a .986 career fielding percentage. Former all- time leader in career stolen bases, Lou Brock, considered Foote one of the toughest catchers on which to attempt a steal of second base. Coaching career Following his playing career, Foote signed a four-year contract with the Yankees to work as a scout. He later became a manager in the Yankees and the Blue Jays organizations. Foote was named Manager of the Year with the Fort Lauderdale Yankees of the Florida State League in , and Manager of the Year with the Myrtle Beach Blue Jays of the South Atlantic League in . Both teams won their respective league championships. Foote also served as a coach for the Chicago White Sox in 1990 and 1991 and the New York Mets in 1992 and 1993.

Constructed at Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, she was constructed too late to take part in World War I and was completed at the Royal Dockyard, Portsmouth. Between the wars, she served on the China Station, Pacific waters, East Indies Waters and from 1936 onwards, in reserve. In World War II she performed four years of arduous war duty, during which time she captured the German blockade runner . Between 22 July 1942 and 24 September 1943 she was converted to a training ship at Rosyth Dockyard. In 1945 she was placed in reserve and scrapped a year later. Background HMS Diomede as completed in 1922. During World War I intelligence reports suggested that the Germans were building a new class of cruiser which could outgun the existing C-class light cruisers. It was believed that an improved C class with an added super-firing gun in front of the deckhouse (and the requisite increase of beam and adapting of superstructure) would maintain British naval superiority in a battle. In September 1916 the first three ships of the new class (, and ) were launched and a second group (, and ) was ordered in July 1917. Diomede, was part of a third tranche ordered in March 1918. This group was to have comprised six vessels, but the end of the war saw this reduced to two, Diomede and . Diomede had been laid down Vickers Armstrong of Barrow-in-Furness in mid-1918, but after launching in 1919 work was suspended. However, in 1922 she was towed to the Royal Dockyard, Portsmouth and completed on 22 February. Like the second group of Danae-class vessels, Diomede was fitted with a trawler bow. Diomede was unique in her class in having an experimental fully enclosed 6-inch mounting in the \\"A\\" position. Before completion, the suitability of her conversion to a royal yacht had been discussed, but nothing came of the idea. Early career Upon commissioning Diomede joined the 5th Light Cruiser Squadron on the China Station in 1922. In 1925 she was transferred to the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy at Devonport where she served until 1935, apart from a refit in 1929-1930. In 1931 she rendered assistance to the town of Napier, New Zealand after the devastating Hawkes Bay earthquake, supplying medical personnel, equipment, guards and firemen, along with her sister ship Dunedin. Afterwards Diomede escorted the beach-damaged sloop to Auckland. The Executive officer at the time (1930-1933) was Commander, later Admiral Victor Crutchley, who was to later become entwined with the Pacific Campaign of World War II. Upon the notification that the two cruisers of the New Zealand Division were to be replaced by cruisers, in 1935 Diomede started her voyage home to Britain to be paid off into the reserve. En route the Abyssinian Crisis broke out and she was diverted to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron, part of the East Indies Station based at Aden for possible action against the Italians. Upon relief by the cruiser on 31 March 1936 she was paid off and spent the next three years in the reserve fleet or as a troop ship. World War II HMS Diomede in 1924 as in 1939. With the growing likelihood of war, Diomede was reactivated. 3 September 1939 found her with the 7th Cruiser Squadron serving as part of the Home Fleet on Northern Patrol duties. Before the despatch of the 7th Cruiser Squadron to the Mediterranean in 1940 in light of the Italian threat, Diomede was attached to the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the America and West Indies Station on shipping protection and patrolling duty. On 8 December 1940 she chased the German blockade runner Idarwald from Tampico, Mexico. Before a capture could be effected the crew of the German freighter set it afire and scuttled it off Cabo Corrientes, Cuba. The US destroyer observed the proceedings. In early 1942 Diomede joined the 9th Cruiser Squadron as part of the South Atlantic and West African Squadron.

This results in a number of physiological effects in various systems, most notably the brain. The enzyme is most active toward neutral D-amino acids, and not active toward acidic D-amino acids. One of its most important targets in mammals is D-Serine in the central nervous system. By targeting this and other D-amino acids in vertebrates, DAAO is important in detoxification. The role in microorganisms is slightly different, breaking down D-amino acids to generate energy. DAAO is expressed in a wide range of species from yeasts to human. It is not present in plants or in bacteria which instead use D-amino acid dehydrogenase. DAAO in humans is a candidate susceptibility gene and together with G72 may play a role in the glutamatergic mechanisms of schizophrenia. DAAO also plays a role in both biotechnological and medical advancements. Risperidone and sodium benzoate are inhibitors of DAAO. D-amino acid oxidase is different from diamine oxidase that are both sometimes referred to as DAO. History In 1935, Hans Adolf Krebs discovered D-amino acid oxidase after an experiment with porcine kidney homogenates and amino acids. Shortly after, Warburg and Christian observed the oxidase had a FAD cofactor making it the second flavoenzyme to be discovered. In the upcoming years other scientists developed and improved the purification procedure for a porcine D-amino acid oxidase. In 1983, inhibitors for the oxidase were discovered. In 2006, the 3D structure of the oxidase was published. Currently, the link between human D-amino acid oxidase (hDAAO) activity and schizophrenia is being researched. Structure and properties left While D-amino acid oxidase differs to some extent between various organisms, the structure is basically the same across most eukaryotes, excluding plants. This enzyme is a flavoprotein belonging to the FAD dependent oxidoreductase family, and acts on the CH-NH2 group of D-amino acid donors with oxygen as acceptor. It is also considered a peroxisomal enzyme containing FAD as a cofactor. Each DAO monomer has an FAD-binding domain (FBD) containing a Rossmann fold, and a substrate-binding domain (SBD) that also forms an interface with the other monomer in the protein. DAO exists as a dimer, with each monomer containing both an FBD and SBD. Each monomer is composed of 347 amino acids in human DAO, though among other eukaryotes the protein can range from 345 to 368 amino acids long. In human DAO, the two monomers are connected in a head-to-head fashion. DAO of other organisms, such as yeast, can be present as head-to-tail dimers. The hDAAO gene is found on chromosome 12 and contains 11 exons. DAO is capable of reducing oxygen quickly, and when reduced can stabilize anionic red semiquinone, and it is capable of forming a covalent bond with sulfites. These are all typical properties associated with flavoproteins. Human DAAO has slightly different properties from other DAAO molecules, including a weaker ability to bind FAD and decreased rate of reaction for some molecules, such as flavin. Actions in the brain DAO acts in the brain to oxidize specific D-amino acids using the FAD region (flavin adenine dinucleotide region) and is commonly thought to be produced in the hindbrain, although there is new evidence of DAO expression in the forebrain as well. The DAO present in the forebrain seems to be inactive, however, causing speculation on the topic of DAO function in the forebrain as opposed to the hindbrain where the function is more well-known. The consensus is that DAO is produced and is active in glial cells, most specifically in cerebellar type-1 and type-2 astrocytes, and the D-serine amino acid that is produced by DAO in these cells has been shown to increase synaptic NMDA receptor activity. Impact on schizophrenia There is evidence to show that schizophrenia, as a neural phenomenon, is caused by the inappropriate activity of NMDA receptors and the related increase in glutamate activity associated with NMDA receptors. SchizophreniaBrain It has been shown that increased DAO activity produces more D-serine, which in turn has been shown to increase NMDA activity in the hypothalamus. A study confirmed the increased NMDA activity and showed increased DAO activity in the cerebellum of schizophrenia subjects. The genetic background of DAO involvement in schizophrenia is highly debated, and no compulsatory evidence has been found for DAO genes being strongly linked to schizophrenia. Although, the G72 gene, which reportedly encodes the D-amino acid oxidase activator, may be involved in the development of schizophrenia. Regulation Bassoon protein and pLG72, are the current known proteins to physically interact and modulate human DAAO. plG72 is the product of the primate-specific G72 gene, and higher levels of both were observed in schizophrenia patients. Interaction of plG72 with hDAAO was observed to cause a time-dependent inactivation with the oxidase. This is believed to be caused by plG72 binding limiting the amount of the enzyme that is catalytically competent, and can be negated by the cofactor or any active- site ligands. The plG72 structure is not fully determined so the specific physical interaction with hDAAO is not completely understood as well. Experiments with the basson protein and hDAAO has resulted with a decrease in enzymatic activity similar to plG72. Researchers suspect the bassoon protein prevents D-Serine depletion particularly in the presynaptic neuron. Additionally, researchers focused on compounds that could act as hDAAO inhibitors. Over 500 different compounds have been observed in vitro/in vivo to act as inhibitors on the oxidase and most of them do by competitive inhibition. All of these compounds have two similar, main portions. The first portion is the planar portion which interacts with the active site of hDAAO. The planar site‚Äôs chemical structure is formed by one or two fused rings and must have a negatively charged carboxylic group. The second portion is the substrate chain, which can participate in the active zone or entrance of the enzyme. Furthermore, the different compounds are divided into multiple categories (classical, novel, second generation, third generation) depending on the chemical structures. An example of a compound is benzoate, which is a classical inhibitor. The carboxylic group of benzoate interacts with Arg238, and the aromatic interacts with Tyr224 on the active zone of the oxidase. Applications Biotechnology = Cephalosporin synthesis = D-amino acid oxidase is used in biotechnology primarily to produce antibiotics called cephalosporins. The use of D-amino acid oxidase for the creation of antibiotics is a patented production of antibiotics and started in 1970. Originally the D-amino acid oxidase used in this process was taken from a pig‚Äôs kidney and was given the name pkDAAO. PkDAAO is very unstable throughout the processes of antibiotic synthesis and therefore gave a low yield of antibiotics. Through continued research a more successful form of D-amino acid oxidase was discovered from a yeast species named Rhodotorula gracilis and therefore was named RgDAAO. RgDAAO is now used as the primary D-amino acid oxidase used in cephalosporin antibiotics because the immobilization on commercial ion exchange resins creates a more stable system that yields much higher amounts of antibiotics. = D-amino acid biosensor = D-amino acid oxidase reacts to D-amino acids and can be used to detect the amount of D-amino acids in foods to act as a biosensor. This is important due to the effects of D-amino acids in the D-isomer or multiple enantiomers present in food has on the nutritional value. The more D-isomer or multiple enantiomers present in food, the lower the nutritional value of the food is, so using D-amino acid oxidase to detect these allows for an increase in selection for nutritionally valuable foods. There is no evidence to prove that D-amino acids are toxic, but it raises many possible concerns whether some foods are toxic. Medical = Cancer treatment = RgDAAO is used in a process called gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) to treat tumors in cancer patients. This treatment uses RgDAAO as the enzyme and D-alanine as a substrate to create a reactive oxygen species H2O2 as a product. H2O2 permeates through tumor cells and damages biopolymers. The damage done by H2O2 creates a cytotoxic metabolite from a nontoxic prodrug within the tumor cells, which then creates a toxic substance in those cells alone. This process is beneficial for cancer patients, because this treatment is toxic only to tumor cells, while chemotherapy is toxic to all cells in the patient's body. D-amino acid oxidase also plays a role in 4-Methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid (MTOBA) production, which is used as an anticancer drug which induces apoptosis of cancer cells. = Therapeutic treatments = D-amino acid oxidase is used in therapeutic treatments such as regulation of hormones, regulation of hypertension, treatment of schizophrenia, treatment of psychiatric and cognitive disorders, and possible pain reduction. Changing the amount of D-amino acid oxidase transporters with the use of drugs has therapeutic effects on schizophrenia. D-amino acid oxidase regulates D-Aspartate, which regulates the secretion of melatonin, prolactin, testosterone, luteinizing hormone and growth hormone. By regulating D-amino acid oxidase, D-Aspartate can also be regulated and control hormone secretion. Increased D-amino acid oxidase activity has been correlated with psychiatric and cognitive disorders, so reducing D-amino acid oxidase can have therapeutic effects on these disorders. D-amino acid oxidase helps produce L-6-hydroxynorleucine, which then generates Omapatrilat. Omapatrilat inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase and effectively reduces hypertension. D-amino acid oxidase also may have an effect on pain stimuli, but it is not confirmed yet.

The South West of England Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) was one of the nine Regional Development Agencies set up by the United Kingdom government in 1999. Its purpose was to lead the development of a sustainable economy in South West England, investing to unlock the region's business potential. It was abolished along with all the other RDAs on 31 March 2012, with some of its functions being replaced by local enterprise partnerships. Areas covered The SWRDA covered the following areas: *Dorset (including Bournemouth and Poole) *Devon (including Plymouth and Torbay) *Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly *Somerset *The West of England (including Bristol and Bath) *Gloucestershire *Wiltshire and Swindon The head office was in Exeter with other offices in Bristol, Plymouth and Truro. Regional economic strategy Each of England's RDAs was required to work with partners in the region to draw together a Regional Economic Strategy. This document set out for the whole region how the RDA's statutory objectives would be met and the region developed. These strategies were owned by the whole region, not just the RDA. They provided the context for other economic development and regeneration activity in the region and provided government departments with a framework that set out the direction that policies in the South West should support. The SWRDA's plans were aligned with three strategic objectives: * Successful and competitive businesses * Strong and inclusive communities * An effective and confident region Projects The SWRDA invested in and supported over 5,800 economic development projects, large and small, across the region during its lifetime. Significant examples include: *Wave Hub, the world‚Äôs largest ocean test site for marine renewable energy devices. *The Eden Project, with over ¬£1bn economic impact since opening in 2001. *National Composites Centre, a world-class centre for composite material manufacture and design. *Combined Universities in Cornwall, transforming higher education in Cornwall since 2001. *Regional Infrastructure Fund, providing essential infrastructure across the region in places such as Poole, Taunton, east of Exeter and Bristol. *Marine Skills Centres in Poole, Plymouth and Falmouth, delivering over 14,000 marine training courses. *Osprey Quay, a ¬£38 million investment to revitalise a former Royal Navy air base ‚Äì including bringing the Olympic sailing regatta to Weymouth and Portland. *Airbus ‚ÄòIntegrated Wing‚Äô project, generating over 850 highly skilled jobs and ¬£40 million added-value to the economy. *PRIMARE and Plymouth Science and Innovation Programme, a ¬£7.3 million investment for world-beating marine energy knowledge collaboration. *Major urban regeneration investment in ‚Äì among others ‚Äì Bristol, Gloucester, Plymouth, Swindon and St Austell. *Rural Development Programme for England across the region, including Gloucestershire, Somerset, Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwall. Positive impact Figures published in 2010 showed that the SWRDA‚Äôs work had: *Created or safeguarded 43,600 jobs *Helped start-up 3,100 new businesses *Attracted ¬£1.3 billion of additional public and private sector investment into the region. *Provided 130,000 people with new work- related skills *Through the regional Business Link network, helped over 100,000 businesses improve their performance and save over ¬£220 million in costs. In 2010/11 the SWRDA invested ¬£239 million (its largest spend in a single year) in initiatives across South West England from its own funds and from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE), in all benefiting over 500 live projects. SWRDA managed delivery of the RDPE grant initiative through extensive partnership working, and the formation of a dedicated network of contracted county based project facilitators and business advisors. Criticism The SWRDA had an annual budget of around ¬£160 million and spent almost ¬£2 million opening offices as far away as Australia and China, and had offices or representatives in five international cities. SWRDA admitted in 2008 that it had spent ¬£1,871,829 on international offices and staff since 2005 - these include Boston in the US, Tokyo in Japan, Shenzhen in China, Melbourne in Australia and Mumbai in India. In the 2007‚Äì8 financial year, SWRDA also started an operation in Mumbai, which contributed to a total spend of ¬£555,880.43. In March 2008 former Bristol Lord Mayor Peter Abraham criticised the SWRDA for these actions, saying that it should be more publicly accountable.SWRDA should be more publicly accountable The SWRDA was also criticised in December 2007 for spending more than ¬£60,000 of taxpayers' money at a property trade show on the French Riviera, ¬£61,000 on its annual staff conference in Wiltshire, plus ¬£28,279 on another staff meeting in Torquay. Further criticism, mostly from Cornwall, said that RDAs were unelected, unrepresentative and unaccountable quangos; that the area covered by the SWRDA was an artificially-imposed large region and not natural; and called for a Cornish Development Agency to be set up.Mebyon Kernow says Cornwall needs its own Development Agency (archived here) Related bodies The South West Science and Industry Council advised the SWRDA on the effective use of science, technology and creativity. The SWRDA provided funding for the South West Observatory, a not-for-profit organisation which produces key data and facts about the region.

Such work is generally of a temporary nature, often with no guaranteed employment term. A contract attorney is Civil litigation The work of contract attorneys often varies. They can be engaged activities such as document review in response to a document subpoenas or request for production of documents. In such projects, contract attorneys may review tens of thousands, if not millions, of pages of documents and mark them as responsive to a particular request, or protected as attorney work product or under the attorney‚Äìclient privilege. Large firms have learned that contract attorneys can perform this work much more cost effectively than high-priced associates. Many contract, or freelance, attorneys perform legal research, draft legal briefs, and provide a full range of other services to law firms of all sizes. These attorneys typically work for themselves, rather than for temporary agencies, and provide their services to other law firms on an as-needed basis. Some people who hold juris doctor degrees, but who are awaiting bar admission, work as temporary professionals in law firms doing the same type of work as contract attorneys. In other situations, a law firm may, due to a conflict of interest, be required to hire a contract attorney as Cumis counsel in certain cases. Contract attorneys typically work on a project-by-project basis and are not full-time law firm employees. However, they also develop long-lasting relationships with firms that regularly or semi-regularly send work to the contract attorney. Many small firms find that the use of contract attorneys provides them the flexibility to grow their business without hiring salaried employees. According to the American Bar Association, law firms can add a surcharge to the fees of their contract attorneys so long as the final fee charged to the client is reasonable. Particularly in a slowing economy, the use of contract attorneys gives firms a competitive edge in the marketplace, helping them to control costs while increasing profitability. Criticisms In writing about the disparity between CEO and worker pay, New York Times best-selling author and social critic Barbara Ehrenreich said: Assigned counsel work in criminal defense In counties without a public defender, or without an alternate defender, a contract attorney may be hired to do assigned counsel work. A legal aid group may be hired to do such work as if a temporary work agency, such as the Legal Aid Society of New York City. Other states or counties may have a panel of lawyers who act as contract attorneys. Some critics of this system have accused the method of leading to ineffective assistance of counsel in criminal cases. Contract legal assistant A law firm may, under certain circumstances, hire a freelance paralegal, commonly known as a contract legal assistant, to perform many of the tasks that a contract attorney might perform.Brent D.

On the day of his death at Potosi, 100,000 men in the silver mines stopped work to assist at his funeral. Works *' (1608); *' 1613; *' 1611.

He was close to Charlemagne and a partisan of his successor, Louis the Pious, throughout the latter's tumultuous reign. He was appointed the third archbishop of Trier in 811 by Charlemagne. In 813 he was sent as the chief Frankish ambassador to the court of Michael I Rhangabes at Constantinople. On Charlemagne's death in 814, Amalarius resigned his see. In 831, Amalarius travelled to Rome to meet Pope Gregory IV and arrange a new Frankish liturgy. In 835, he replaced Agobard at the Synod of Diedenhofen. During Agobard's exile (c. 834) he was responsible for administering the Diocese of Lyon.Eric Palazzo, 'Amalarius of Metz', in Andr√© Vauchez, ed, Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, (2002) He implemented liturgical reforms. He wrote extensively on the Mass,On the Liturgy, ed. Eric Knibbs, 2 vols.

Car Company. Biography The one-off special built in 1925 for Cecil Kimber and known as the MG 'Old Number One' Kimber was born in London on 12 April 1888 to Henry Kimber, a printing engineer and his wife Fanny. After attending Stockport Grammar School he joined his father's company and took an early interest in motorcycles, buying a Rex model, but after an accident on a friend's machine that severely damaged his right leg he took to cars and in 1913 bought a 10 hp Singer. This interest caused him to leave the family firm in 1914 and get a job with Sheffield-Simplex as assistant to the chief designer. During World War I he moved first to AC Cars and then to component supplier EG Wrigley. He made a large personal financial investment in Wrigleys but he lost this when the company lost heavily on a deal with Angus-Sanderson for whom he had styled a radiator. Wrigley had also been a major supplier to Morris Motors Limited and was bought by W R Morris in 1923. Presumably with the help of contacts, Kimber got a job in 1921 as Sales manager with Morris Garages, also a private company owned by Morris ‚Äî he founded it in 1909 ‚Äî and the Morris agency in Oxford. While at Morris Garages he developed a range of special bodies for Morris cars, which were sold under the MG brand, eventually leading in 1928 to the founding of The M.G. Car Company specialising in the production of MG sports cars. The new company moved from Oxford to Abingdon in 1929 and Kimber became managing director in July 1930. The main shareholder remained William Morris himself and in 1935 he formally sold M.G. to Morris Motors which meant Kimber was no longer in sole control and had to take instructions from head office leading to him becoming increasingly disillusioned with his role. With the outbreak of World War II, car production stopped and at first M.G. was reduced to making basic items for the armed forces until Kimber obtained contract work on aircraft but this was done without first obtaining approval and he was asked to resign and left in 1941. He soon found other work first with coachbuilder Charlesworth and then with specialist piston maker Specialloid.  Death  Kimber was killed in the King's Cross railway accident on Sunday 4 February 1945, having boarded the 6:00 p.m. express to Leeds. Shortly after leaving the station and entering Gasworks Tunnel, the locomotive's wheels started slipping on a newly replaced section of rail laid on the rising gradient. In the darkness, the driver failed to realise that the train was no longer moving forward and had started to roll back at a speed of some . The signalman noticed this and attempted to avert a collision with another train in the station by switching the points to an empty platform but was too late. The rear carriage was derailed, rolled onto its side and was crushed against the steel support of the main signal gantry. The first-class compartment where Kimber had been sitting was demolished; he and one other passenger was killed. Cecil Kimber married twice, first to Irene (Rene) Hunt with whom he had two daughters, Lisa and Jean, and after Irene died in 1938 to Muriel Dewar. He was elected as President of the Automobile Division of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Joshi (Shri Dattateya Dnyankosh Prakashan, Pune, 2000) According to the Shri GuruCharitra, he is the second avatar of Dattatreya in Kaliyuga after Sripada Sri Vallabha.http://www.sreedattavaibhavam.org/sree-nrusimha-saraswati-swamy Life Shri Narasimha Saraswati lived from 1378 to 1459 (Shaka 1300 to Shaka 1380).Shri Narasimha Saraswati (Karanja) page with Shri Guru Charitra. Saraswati was born into a Deshastha Brahmin family in Karanjapur, which is modern-day Lad-Karanja (Karanja), in the Washim district Maharashtra Vidarbha region of India.http://www.gurumandir.org/ His father (Madhav) and his mother (Amba-Bhavani) initially named him Narahari or Shaligramadeva, with the surname Kale. He was name Narahari by his parents. First Incarnation - Sripada Srivallabha This is sketch of Sri Nrusinh saraswati Shri Narasimha Sarswati is considered to be the second incarnation of Dattatreya, the first Incarnation was Sripada Srivallabha, as per his blessings to Amba Bhavani, in her previous birth, Sripada Srivallabh had blessed her & he advised her to perform shiva pooja. Later he also told that he would be born to her in her next life as Narasimha Saraswathi to uphold the Sanatha Dharma in Kali yuga. This instance has been well narrated from chapter 5 to Chapter 12 in the holy book Guru Charithra Guru Mandir Karanja-Birthplace Narasimha Saraswati was a quiet child, who did not speak much during childhood. This led his parents to worry about his speech ability; however, Saraswati showed through hand gestures that after his upanayana (munji) (sacred thread ceremony), he would be able to speak. He started reciting the Vedas after his munja, which so impressed the Brahmins in the village that it was talked about, with senior learned Brahmins coming to him for learning. Narasimha Saraswati left home in 1386 at a tender age of 8 all alone and went on a pilgrimage to Kashi on foot. He took Sanyasa at Kashi from Shri Krishna Saraswati. The second part of his name came from this guru, who eventually named him Shri Narasimha Saraswati. (This is a Sanskrit name.) After becoming a Sanyasi, Narasimha Saraswati visited several holy places before returning to Karanja at the age 30 to meet his parents. He visited various places before settling in Ganagapura (Ganagapur) (now in the state of Karnataka) for the last 20 years of his life. Towards the end of his life, Narasimha Saraswati met with the Muslim king (Sultan) of Bidar who was possibly Mahmood Shah Bahmani I of the Bahamani Sultanate, who was the area ruler at that time. Since his karma for that avatar had completed, thus he decided to take samadhi. He left for the jungle of Kadali (Kadali vanam near Srisailam). Saraswati took nijgamananand ((‡§®‡§ø‡§ú‡§ó‡§Æ‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶) type of samadhi) in 1459 for 300 years.Akkalkot Niwasi Shree Swami Samarth (Shri Narasimha Saraswati) Complete Biography Chronology The main events of Sri Narasimha Saraswati's life are given below.

Controversy In December 2015, the Bowmanville Zoo owner, Michael Hackenberger was accused by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) of animal cruelty. PETA released a video taken secretly which showed Hackenberger cursing and cracking a whip numerous times at a young Siberian tiger named Uno. In response to PETA's allegations, Hackenberger released his own video statement. In it, he asserts that although his \\"language is atrocious and I apologize for that,\\" \\"PETA, once again, is lying.\\" He stated that only two of the 19 cracks of the whip shown in the video struck the tiger, with the remainder striking either the air or the ground immediately adjacent to the tiger. He also challenged PETA to release the full length of the video taken. Earlier in 2015, Hackenberger was filmed on live television swearing at a baboon for failing to complete a trick, which involved its jumping off the back of a miniature pony. On April 13, 2016, as a result of the video of Michael Hackenberger whipping the leashed tiger, five animal cruelty charges were brought against him. The Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals says it began investigating alleged abuse at the Bowmanville Zoo immediately after reviewing the footage that emerged in December. The agency said the zoo's owner, Michael Hackenberger, was charged with four counts of causing an animal distress; causing an animal distress by striking the animal with a whip handle, causing an animal distress by repeatedly striking an animal with a whip, causing an animal to be in distress by striking the animal in the face with a whip, and causing an animal distress by pushing his thumb into the animals eye. The last charge was one of failing to comply with the prescribed standards of care for an animal. Three of the distress charges relate to the use of a whip, and one related to Hackenberger pushing his thumb into the tigers eye. The OSPCA said it would continue to conduct inspections of the zoo and continue to closely monitor the animals there. On March 23, 2017, the charges against Michael Hackenberger were judicially stayed. They were automatically withdrawn a year later, on March 23, 2018.  Closure  On June 23, 2016, the zoo announced that it would close its doors at the end of the 2016 season, just three years short of its 100-year anniversary which was to occur in 2019. Zoo officials announced that the closure would occur as a result of financial issues caused by a catastrophic decline in attendance following the zoo's owner being charged with animal cruelty. The zoo officially closed its doors on October 10, 2016. In 2017 the property re-opened as Clarington Family Outdoor Adventure Park and still featured lions and some staff from previous operations.

Edwards was born in Whitechapel, in the East End of London. He briefly worked as a carman from 1917 and in 1918 enlisted in the Royal Navy as a stoker and served until 1923. He then became a docker. He joined the Labour Party and the Transport and General Workers' Union and in 1937 was appointed a full-time officer with the union's Docks Group. From 1935 to 1939 he was chairman of the Whitechapel Labour Party. In the Second World War he was recalled as a Naval reservist and rose to the rate of Leading Stoker. In 1942 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Whitechapel and St Georges, the first serving Royal Navy rating to be elected to Parliament. Following boundary changes in 1950, he was elected for the new Stepney constituency and served until his retirement in 1964. He served as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1945 to 1951. A devout Roman Catholic, he was known as a campaigner against prostitution, which was a big problem in his constituency. He died on the day of the 1964 general election. Edwards was elected to Stepney Borough Council in 1934 and served on it until 1959. In 1944‚Äì1945, when he was already an MP, he served as mayor. Edwards' only son was killed on active service in 1944. He also had a daughter.

It is located on the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line. The station is managed by West Midlands Trains, who provide the majority of train services; there are also occasional services provided by Chiltern Railways. History The station was opened on 1 May 1885 by the Great Western Railway on their line from Birmingham Snow Hill to Stourbridge Junction. There was also a Great Western Railway branch from here to Oldbury, a large town to the north. The Oldbury branch closed to passengers on 3 March 1915; and until recently a short stub of the disused line remained in situ. Its platforms can still be seen at Langley Green station. The line from Smethwick West through to Snow Hill closed in 1972. In the run up to closure the sparse service to Snow Hill terminated at Langley Green, with Kidderminster services diverted into Birmingham New Street. This continued until 1995 when the line through Snow Hill to Birmingham Moor Street was restored. Some Hereford and Worcester to New Street trains continued to run via the Smethwick Jcn - Galton Junction curve until May 2004, but the route today is only used for diversions if the normal route to Snow Hill is closed for engineering work. Services The typical Monday-Saturday daytime service is every 30 minutes, between Stourbridge Junction and Birmingham Snow Hill, with alternate trains continuing beyond Birmingham to Dorridge or Whitlocks End.

His most famous contributions were to the field of chronobiology, where he proposed a model for the endogenous circadian rhythms governing plant photoperiodism. From these contributions, B√ºnning is considered a co-founder of chronobiology along with J√ºrgen Aschoff and Colin Pittendrigh. Life Early life and education B√ºnning was born on 23 January 1906 in Hamburg, Germany to Heinrich B√ºnning and Hermine B√ºnning (born Winkler). A teacher of German, English, mathematics, and biology, B√ºnning's father was the primary academic influence on Erwin's early life, passing on to Erwin a passion for botany. B√ºnning received his primary education in Hamburg from 1912-1925. B√ºnning then attended the University of G√∂ttingen and the University of Berlin from October 1925-July 1928, where he studied biology, chemistry, physics, and philosophy. B√ºnning earned his Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Berlin in May 1929. During this time, B√ºnning married his wife Eleanore; the two would later have three children. Academic career In 1930, B√ºnning took an assistantship under Otto Renner at the University of Jena, then one of Germany's largest botanical institutes. During the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany in the early 1930s, Renner stood in open opposition to the Nazis, publicly defending Jewish scientists. Similarly, B√ºnning was considered a communist sympathizer, a stance likely influenced by B√ºnning's father, a Social Democrat opposed to the Nazis. B√ºnning's political beliefs created tension between him and some of his students. In response to this tension, B√ºnning left Jena for a lectureship at the East Prussian University of K√∂nigsberg. In 1936, B√ºnning published his model for plant photoperiodism, wherein he proposed that endogenous (internal) circadian rhythms enable plants to measure day length. B√ºnning's model of photoperiodism would go largely unnoticed by the scientific community until 1960 when he chaired the 1960 Cold Spring Harbor Symposium on Biological Clocks. There, Colin Pittendrigh drew attention to B√ºnning's work and named his 1936 model on plant photoperiodism the B√ºnning hypothesis. B√ºnning spent most of his academic career at the University of T√ºbingen In 1938, B√ºnning spent a year traveling through Java and Sumatra. His observations on the islands resulted in the book Tropische Regenwalder (Tropical Rainforests). Upon his return to Germany in 1939, B√ºnning was conscripted in the German military (World War II). Military authorities appointed B√ºnning as an associate professor at the University of Strasbourg. After the war, B√ºnning became a full professor at the University of Cologne in 1945 before moving to the University of T√ºbingen the next year (1946), where he stayed until his retirement in 1971. At T√ºbingen, B√ºnning entered into the workspace of his role model Wilhelm Pfeffer, the man who postulated in 1875 that the orientation of plants in space changes with the time of day. B√ºnning would later publish a biography on Pfeffer. Later life and legacy Over his career, B√ºnning published over 260 papers in the fields of plant physiology and general biology, as well as a very popular textbook on plant physiology. B√ºnning suffered from Alzheimer's Disease and died on 4 October 1990 in T√ºbingen, Germany after contracting pneumonia. Following his death, the German newspaper Schw√§bisches Tagblatt described B√ºnning as one of the greatest botanists of the 20th century. Key contributions Historical context Changes in the positioning of plant leaves over the course of the day were observed as early as the 4th century B.C. by Androsthenes, Alexander the Great‚Äôs historian. This phenomenon, however, was not researched further until 1729 when Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan provided experimental data that mimosa plants close their leaves at night, a movement that persists rhythmically in constant darkness. In 1875, Wilhelm Pfeffer, B√ºnning‚Äôs role model, put forward that these movements might be controlled by an endogenous biological clock. This theory formed the foundation for B√ºnning‚Äôs later work. Prior to B√ºnning‚Äôs work, the prevailing hypothesis on circadian rhythms was the \\"hourglass\\" hypothesis, which postulates that circadian rhythmicity within an organism is entirely driven by the external light-dark cycle and that an organism's \\"hourglass\\" is reset each day. B√ºnning, however, proposed that biological clocks are endogenous and synchronize to daily stimuli. Unlike in the hourglass hypothesis, B√ºnning's hypothesis proposes that circadian rhythmicity derives from an interaction between light and a circadian pacemaker, not external stimuli alone. The general premise of B√ºnning's hypothesis became a model for circadian time keeping across species off of which many chronobiologists, even into the present, base their models. Experiments In the early-1930s, B√ºnning proposed that organisms rely on a circadian rhythm of sensitivity to light to measure photoperiod. He demonstrated that plants open and close their leaves and insects eclose according to circadian rhythms, even in continuous light or darkness. His crossing experiments with bean plants of different periods in 1935 demonstrated that the next generation had periods of intermediate durations, supporting the suggestion that circadian rhythms are heritable. B√ºnning also demonstrated that an artificial photoperiod can induce flowering at inappropriate times, supporting his model of endogenous oscillators entrained to external stimuli. To create artificial photoperiods, B√ºnning exposed plants to a light-dark cycle indicative of a specific season, such as the long days and short nights of summer. By entraining the plants to a spring or summer photoperiod, B√ºnning was able to induce flowering, even if the actual season were fall or winter. From his results, B√ºnning proposed that biological clocks have sensors for both light and dark, and their relationship aids photoperiodic timekeeping. His published works provided key synthesis of existing evidence for biological clocks across species, including plants, flies, and fungi. His 1958 work, \\"The Physiological Clock\\", was hailed as a milestone in the field of chronobiology, and his later works on plant physiology helped apply his work on photoperiodism to practical uses. In 1935 he demonstrated that plants with different inherent periods would become desynchronized in constant conditions. This work provided evidence for the dismissal of the \\"Factor X\\" hypothesis, which held that circadian rhythms were not endogenous, and were instead reliant on an unknown external stimulus, some \\"Factor X.\\" B√ºnning's model B√ºnning was the pioneer of the \\"B√ºnning Hypothesis,\\" later known as the External Coincidence model. This model proposed a circadian rhythm of photoperiodic photosensitivity in plants. As day length increases with the spring and summer seasons, for example, light hits a plant's photosensitive phase, triggering a physiological or behavioral response. The B√ºnning Hypothesis proposed that light has two functions for an organism: 1\\\\. Light is the primary Zeitgeber for the synchronization of biological rhythms. 2\\\\. Light triggers photoinductive responses during certain phases of the circadian cycle. Honors B√ºnning received many honors in his life both in the field of chronobiology and botany. In 1960, he chaired in the 25th Cold Spring Harbor Symposium, \\"Biological Clocks\\". The next year, B√ºnning was elected Corresponding Member of the Botanical Society of America. During his life he was also elected honorary member of the Japanese Botanical Society, the German Botanical Society, the American Society of Plant Physiologists, and the Swiss Botanical Society. He became an elected member of the American Philosophical Society, the Heidelberg Academy for Sciences and Humanities, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Academy of Scientists, Leopoldina. In addition, he was elected a Foreign Associate of the American National Academy of Sciences (1968), Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, and an Honorary Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (1986). In 1973 B√ºnning won the Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award for \\"meritorious work in plant biology.\\" The Universities of Glasgow (1974), Freiburg (1976), and Erlangen (1977) conferred honorary doctorates on him, as did the University of G√∂ttingen B√ºnning is considered by many to be the father of the field of chronobiology. His work on measuring the free-running period of plant rhythms and experiments with cross-breeding strains of plants with different periods aided in the development of that field.

Early life Princess Rambai Barni Svastivatana was born on 20 December 1904, to Prince Svasti Sobhana, the Prince of Svastivatana Visishta (a son of HM King Mongkut and Princess Piyamawadi) and Princess Abha Barni Gaganang. She was given the nickname, Thanying Na or Princess Na (. At the age of two she entered the palace, to be \\"given\\" to a queen for education as was the custom. In Princess Rambai Barni's case it was Queen Saovabha, wife of HM King Chulalongkorn (her aunt). From then on she lived at Dusit Palace. After the death of King Chulalongkorn in 1910, she was moved to the Grand Palace, where she studied at the Rajini School (or Queen's School) set up by Queen Saovabha. During this period she became very close to her cousin, Queen Saovabha's youngest son, Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej, the Prince of Sukhothai. In 1917, after completing his studies abroad and the customary period of monasticism, Prince Prajadhipok and Princess Rambai Barni were married at Bang Pa-In Palace and given the blessings of her new brother-in-law, King Vajiravudh. The couple lived at the prince's Bangkok residence, Sukhothai Palace. Queen Young Rambai Barni In 1925, King Vajiravudh died without leaving any male issue (his only daughter, Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda, was born a day earlier and palace law dictated that the throne must pass to the next male full-sibling of the king). The crown was then passed on to his younger brother and heir. Princess Rambai Barni's husband ascended the throne as King Prajadhipok (or Rama VII), she was immediately invested with title of Queen Consort of Siam after her husband's own coronation ceremony. Prajadhipok followed his brother's abandonment of polygamy and instead had one queen. Both the king and queen received modern European educations in their youth. Once they inherited the throne they set about modernizing the institution of monarchy, copying European dress and customs. The king and queen spent most of their time away from Bangkok, preferring instead to stay at the beach resort town of Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province at a palace called Klai Kangwon (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏á‡∏ß‡∏•) (or \\"far from worries\\"), which they had built. It was here in June 1932 that the royal couple was told of the revolution instigated by the Khana Ratsadon, which demanded of the absolutist king a constitution for the people of Siam. The event would be a turning point for Rambai Barni and her husband, as the absolute rule of the House of Chakri was replaced by a constitutional regime. In 1933, the couple left Siam for Europe where the king was due to have an eye operation in England. Despite the long distance the king continued to fight with his government back in Bangkok, through letters and telegrams. The fight came to a head when the government refused to accept Prajadhipok's ancient power of pardon. The king first threatened, but when he was ignored, decided to abdicate his throne on 2 March 1935. He was succeeded by his nephew Ananda Mahidol. The couple settled in Surrey, first at Knowle House, then at Glen Pammant. Life in exile The Queen and her husband, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) The couple moved again to Vane Court, the oldest house in the village of Biddenden in Kent. They led a peaceful life there, gardening in the morning and the king writing his autobiography in the afternoon. In 1938 the royal couple moved again to Compton House, in the village of Wentworth in Virginia Water, Surrey. The couple had no children, but adopted the infant son of one of Prajadhipok's deceased brothers. (The stepson, Prince Jirasakdi, would later serve as a RAF fighter pilot during the Battle of Britain. He died on duty in 1942.) Due to active bombing by the German Luftwaffe in 1940, the couple again moved, first to a small house in Devon, and then to Lake Vyrnwy Hotel in Powys, Wales, where the former king suffered a heart attack. King Prajadhipok eventually died from heart failure on 30 May 1941. Leader of the resistance King Rama VII and Queen Rambai Barni in Berlin. After the King's death, the queen became more involved in politics. In December 1941 the Japanese Empire invaded and occupied Thailand. The Japanese government forced the Thai government to declare war on both the United Kingdom and the United States. The Free Thai Movement was set up partially by Thai exiles living abroad. The movement included many diplomats, students, and members of the royal family. The queen and her brother, Prince Subhasvastiwongse Snith Svastivatana, made clear their Free Thai sympathies and used their connections to assist like-minded students in organising a resistance movement in the UK. She was among the four women who volunteered for non-military tasks with the Free Thai. Despite not being an official member, the queen assisted the movement through fund raising and lobbying influential ministers. Return and death Queen Sirikit (Far left), Princess Galyani Vadhana (center), Princess Hemvadi and Queen Rambhai Barni (right) in 1950 In 1949, the queen was invited to return to Thailand, bringing with her the king's ashes. After her return she continued to carry out many official duties on behalf of the new king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. She spent the rest of her life at Sukhothai Palace, dying in 1984 at the age of 79. She was cremated in a grand royal funeral presided over by her nephew the king at Sanam Luang in front of the Grand Palace.

A particularly distinct custom associated with pepernoten is throwing them in handfuls through the room so children can look for them.

Her songwriting career started in 1980. Her classical training influenced her as did a desire to be experimental with her music. Although most popular in Asia, most notably Japan, she remains a cult artist in her native England. Early life Virginia Astley was born in Garston, Hertfordshire, England, alongside her twin, Alison in 1959,Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 207-8 the second daughter of composer Edwin Astley, noted for TV themes such as The Saint, and his wife Hazel Balbirnie, who married in 1945. Virginia Astley's family was from the Warrington area and lived in Grappenhall, where her elder sister Karen was born in 1947. The family relocated to Stanmore in Middlesex because of Edwin's work as a film and TV writer. In the early 1960s he was musical director at ITC Entertainment in Borehamwood, the company responsible for TV series such as The Saint and Danger Man. In 1968 her sister Karen married Pete Townshend of The Who. In the 1970s Virginia's elder brother, Jon Astley, became a tape operator for Eric Clapton and worked his way up to his current activities as a remasterer and producer. Music career Virginia began learning piano at the age of six and flute at 14. After leaving school, she studied at the Guildhall School Of Music. Her first professional appearance in public was as a busker outside South Kensington tube station. In 1980 she auditioned for a new band from Clapham, the Victims of Pleasure. Virginia, playing keyboards, worked with them for a short while playing in clubs and pubs around London. The band released three singles between 1980 and 1982 before splitting up. Afterward, Virginia wrote, arranged and performed music with Skids frontman Richard Jobson for the album The Ballad Of Etiquette. Their collaboration continued when Jobson moved to Belgian label Les Disques Du Cr√©puscule, and Astley contributed to the Cr√©puscule compilation The Fruit of the Original Sin. She also contributed as part of The Dream Makers (in collaboration with filmmaker Jean Paul Goude) for a cover version of \\"La Chanson d'Helene\\" (Helen's Song), showcasing an early example of her distinctive vocal style. It was during this early period that Virginia started to give serious consideration to releasing her own material; however, nothing immediately came of these plans. Then in 1981, she signed to the small UK label Why-Fi and recorded a series of songs. A school friend, Jo Wells (Kissing the Pink) and a university friend Nicky Holland both contributed as did Tony Butler, Mark Brzezicki and Peter Hope-Evans. Virginia then received an offer from another Why-Fi artist, Troy Tate, for a supporting band position with The Teardrop Explodes. In the nineties, finding that her musical style was popular in Japan, she went on to collaborate with Asian artists. Ravishing Beauties Virginia recruited Nicky Holland and another university friend, Kate St. John to form the band the Ravishing Beauties. The trio joined The Teardrops in Liverpool during the winter of 1981 for a series of dates at a small clubs and a UK tour in early 1982. They also recorded with Echo & the Bunnymen, Skids, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Kate St. John and Nicky Holland went on to maintain solo careers in the 1990s at the time of Virginia's reemergence in Japan. The Ravishing Beauties did not record as a band, but appeared on radio shows, including a John Peel Session on BBC Radio 1 in April 1982. The Ravishing Beauties first played at Club Zoo in Liverpool and followed this with the support tour with The Teardrop Explodes. Virginia wrote most of the band's songs, some of which appeared on her first solo project with Why-Fi. The band was short lived, with St. John first becoming a model and then eventually a member of The Dream Academy, while Holland did session work and joined Tears for Fears. Solo work One of the first musicians Astley recorded with was Richard Jobson. Together with John McGeoch and Josephine Wells, they created a musical backdrop for Jobson's poetry. This work was released as The Ballad of Etiquette in late 1981. Later, Astley went with Jobson to perform in Japan. She also worked on other people's projects, including work for Les Disques Du Cr√©puscule label, playing piano and arranging music for Richard Jobson and Anna Domino. She also had a track on From Brussels with Love in 1982. Sessions followed with Richard Jobson and Russell Webb for the final Skids album Joy, which featured Astley on flute and as a backing singer. Astley recorded a solo album, She Stood Up And Cried for Cr√©puscule but this was withdrawn, eventually being released three years later as Promise Nothing. She signed with Why-Fi in mid-1981 and recorded an EP called A Bao A Qu, the title taken from a Malayan legend featured in Jorge Luis Borges's 1967 Book of Imaginary Beings. This was produced by Jon Astley and Phil Chapman. Using a demo studio in Wapping called Elephant Studios, Astley recorded the song that was to place her in the indie top 10 (#8) in 1983: \\"Love's a Lonely Place to Be\\", a song of despair and anxiety in spite of its Christmas carol sound. The song would later form part of the 1986 LP Hope in a Darkened Heart. In 1982 Virginia also played piano on her brother-in-law Pete Townshend's album All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes. The album From Gardens Where We Feel Secure was released in August 1983 and was recorded on Astley's own label Happy Valley and distributed by Rough Trade, which has since reissued it. The album achieved a place in the top 5 of the indie chart (#4), but neither single nor album was listed in the mainstream charts. In 1983, Astley established a more permanent lineup with string players Audrey Riley, Jocelyn Pook and Anne Stephenson, with guests such as drummer Brian Nevill and composer Jeremy Peyton Jones. In 1984, Astley played keyboards on tour with Prefab Sprout around the time of their first album, and she also did sessions for their Kitchenware Records labelmates Martin Stephenson and the Daintees, Vic Godard and Zeke Manyika. In 1984 Virginia signed to Arista but left to join Elektra Records UK. \\"Darkness Has Reached its End\\" and \\"Tender\\" were both recorded at this time. When Elektra UK folded she went to WEA where she subsequently recorded the album Hope in a Darkened Heart with Ryuichi Sakamoto producing in 1986. The success of this album in Japan meant that Virginia was asked to sign to Nippon Columbia with whom she recorded a further two albums, All Shall Be Well in 1992 and Had I The Heavens in 1996. The following year, the first track from the album, \\"Some Small Hope\\" was released, a collaboration with David Sylvian. Since then, Astley has guested on CDs by both Hideaki Matsuoka and the Silent Poets. From Gardens Where We Feel Secure was re-issued with a new cover in 2003, and in 2006 she released her first album of new material in ten years, entitled The Words Between Our Words. This mini album features Astley reciting her own poetry to a backing of harp music. In 2007, she premiered a long poem \\"Ecliptic\\", with flute, harp and birdsong.

Bridcut has been praised for treating such a sensitive subject in \\"an impeccably unsensational tone\\". The Britten-Pears Foundation described the book as having been \\"enthusiastically received as shedding new light on one of the most interesting aspects of Britten's life and career, in a study that is thoroughly researched, wonderfully readable and thought-provoking\\". Bridcut's book followed his television documentary Britten's Children shown on BBC2 in June 2004. Bridcut writes that 13-year-old boys were Britten's ideal. He liked to imagine himself as still thirteen years old and once explained his ability to write so well for children, \\"It's because I'm still thirteen\\".Bridcut, p. 8 Bridcut provides ample evidence that Britten was sexually attracted to young boys, but similarly shows that it is unlikely that Britten ever stepped over the line of propriety. Britten lived with his long-time partner Peter Pears. Nevertheless, as Bridcut notes, there was frequent and continuing gossip in society about Britten's infatuation with boys. Britten would provide each new favourite with gifts and treats, and was a prolific letter-writer. The thousands of surviving letters are the source for many of Bridcut's observations. Britten had a close friendship with Wulff Scherchen (son of the conductor Hermann Scherchen, and later known as John Woolford ) whom he met when Wulff was 14 and Britten 21. Five years later in 1939, Britten dedicated the song \\"Antique\\" from his song cycle Les Illuminations to Wulff. As a German national, Scherchen was interned during World War II, following which he served in the British army. He and Britten continued to correspond, but when they met again in 1942 Britten found the 22-year-old \\"rather altered, I am afraid ... rather vindictive, and hard.\\" The friendship faded, and Wulff eventually married. The relationship with Wulff overlapped Britten's meeting with Peter Pears ‚Äì Pears is also the dedicatee of a song in the Rimbaud cycle. In 1989 Wulff recalled, \\"I adored Peter. He was a wonderful father figure ... and I thought in a sense that he was the father to Benjamin at the same time ... He would restrain Benjamin when Ben was going off the rails ... He had this air of stability that Ben didn't have.\\" Thirteen-year-old Piers Dunkerley, whom Britten met aged 20 and described by Bridcut as \\"emphatically good-looking\\",Bridcut, p. 44 was another early favourite. The composer's website reports that Dunkerley, one of Britten's closest friends, took part in the 1944 Normandy landings. Unlike the other three dedicatees of Britten's War Requiem, Dunkerley \\"survived the war but committed suicide in June 1959, two months before his wedding\\" and three years before the premiere of the requiem at Coventry Cathedral's reconsecration. Thirteen-year-old Harry Morris, whom Britten met in 1936,Bridcut, p. 47 was from a troubled home, and Harry was the only boy ever to accuse Britten of sexual abuse. They were on holiday in Cornwall together and Bridcut recounts that Harry claimed that Britten made \\"what he understood as a sexual approach from Britten in his bedroom\\".Bridcut, p. 52 Harry said he screamed and hit Britten with a chair and then Britten's sister Beth rushed into the room. Harry left the next morning and told his mother what had happened, but she did not believe him. John Bridcut was interviewed by Andrew Marr on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week in June 2006. Britten's sexual attraction for 13/14-year-old boys was the subject of the interview and the incident with Harry Morris, when Britten \\"may have crossed the line\\", was described in detail. Bridcut writes about Britten's friendship with Humphrey Maud which started when the boy was nine. They became close friends a few years later when Humphrey was at Eton. Humphrey's father Sir John Maud, who was then Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Education and would therefore have been wary of any potential scandal, eventually intervened to ask Britten to stop inviting Humphrey to spend school holidays with him at Aldeburgh. Humphrey himself told Bridcut: \\"I certainly don't think that he [Sir John Maud] was ever afraid that I might be the victim of my friendship with Britten. I think it was a precautionary measure; just in case others might think ill of it, it would be as well that it should be seen to stop.\\"Bridcut, pp. 151‚Äì52 Britten dedicated The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra to Humphrey and the other Maud children. Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy was another friend of Britten. Fourteen-year-old Jonny \\"could not help flirting slightly\\" and was \\"at once aware I attracted him\\".Bridcut, p. 160 Jonny and his siblings and cousins provided the children's names for Britten's opera The Little Sweep. David Spenser was thirteen years old when he had the role of Harry in Britten's opera Albert Herring. When he first went to stay with Britten at Crag House, they shared a double bed, Britten explaining that with the recent move from the Old Mill at Snape it was the only bed in the house.Bridcut, p. 156 Not all Britten's young boys were musicians. He was very fond of a local boy Robin Long, known as \\"Nipper\\", and he used to take the boy sailing. Bridcut interviewed a number of Britten's children including the actor David Hemmings. Hemmings was twelve when he came into Britten's life as the creator of the role of Miles in Britten's The Turn of the Screw. The conductor Charles Mackerras observed, \\"David Hemmings was an extremely good looking young chap and he also very much played up to Ben's obvious adoration of him, and drank it in,\\" and adds, \\"Obviously it was a sexual attraction but I'm sure that it was never actually fulfilled.\\"Bridcut, p. 197 Hemmings told Bridcut: \\"He was not only a father to me, but a friend ‚Äì and you couldn't have had a better father or a better friend. [...] Everybody asks me whether or not he gave me one, whether or not it was a sexual relationship. The answer to that question, as I have often said, is: no, he did not. I have slept in his bed, yes, only because I was scared at night...and I have never ever, ever felt threatened by Ben at all because I was more heterosexual than Genghis Khan!\\"Bridcut, p. 199 Bridcut also writes at length about Roger Duncan. Duncan was aged eleven when he first met Britten. Their relationship was unusual in that Britten persuaded Roger's father to share him and Roger spent many weeks staying with Britten. Roger's father was the writer Ronald Duncan, the librettist of The Rape of Lucretia. Both Roger and Humphrey Stone, another young friend, recall enjoying regular naked midnight swims with Britten. Bridcut makes it clear that Britten was inspired by his love of young boys to write extensively for children, and particularly for boy trebles. Among his finest works are The Turn of the Screw, with the dark relationship between Quint and Miles, and Death in Venice, based on Thomas Mann's novella about the tragic love of a novelist for the beautiful boy Tadzio. Jonathan Keates' review in The Daily Telegraph sums up the dilemma of writing about Britten's children: \\"Nowadays a known homosexual who sought out the company and affection of small boys would probably end up on a police register or behind bars. In treating Britten's fondness for the young of his own sex as something more than lipsmacking paedophilia, this book does him a service both as a man and an artist.\\" In a similar vein, in a review in The Times, David Matthews wrote \\"Many paedophiles were abused as children, and their dangerous desires are motivated by hatred. Britten's were motivated by love, which may have been to a large extent narcissistic and, as John Bridcut's book reveals, often ended with an abrupt withdrawal of attention when the boy grew up, but which was fundamentally benign.\\"  Influence  Australian composer Lyle Chan discovered the relationship between Britten and Wulff Scherchen on reading Britten's Children in 2015. He sought out Scherchen, then a 95-year-old man living in Australia, and obtained his consent to create a song cycle out of the story of the relationship. The Serenade for Tenor, Saxophone and Orchestra (\\"My Dear Benjamin\\") was commissioned by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra and premiered at the 2016 Brisbane Festival.

Description  Being the successor of the DM2A3, it features an advanced electrical propulsion system and a fiber optic cable for torpedo guidance and communication, which, in conjunction with advanced signals processing and mission logic, makes the torpedo largely countermeasure resistant. The DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 is the first torpedo ever to be guided by a fiber optic wire. With a fully digital system architecture, increased range and speed and its new conformal array sonar with a very wide panoramic sensor angle as well as the additional wake homing sensor, the DM2A4/SeaHake mod 4 provides greatly advanced performance over its predecessor. The homing head shell is a hydrodynamic optimised parabolic shape which aims to reduce torpedo self-noise and cavitation to an absolute minimum. The homing head's conformal transducer array permits detection angles of +/-100¬∞ in the horizontal and +/-24¬∞ in the vertical, therefore supporting larger acquisition angles in comparison to traditional flat arrays. The wide angle array is designed to reduce maneuvering when in search and reconnaissance stages, therefore also reducing self-noise and preserving battery power. The weapon has a modular design that includes up to four silver zinc battery modules and is able to achieve a range of more than 50 km (27 nmi) and a speed exceeding 92.6 km/h (50 kn) powered by a high frequency permanent magnet motor, with a closed-loop cooling system independent from the environment. Exact performance data are classified. The torpedo design template may also be used as the basis for ROV. The weapon is armed with a 260 kg PBX, (RDX‚Äìaluminium) warhead (equivalent to 460 kg of TNT) with magnetic influence and contact fuzes. The charge and fuse are insensitive and electromagnetic pulse safe. The weapon has a length of 6.6 m when configured with 4 battery modules, and is respectively shorter when configured with either 3 or 2 battery modules depending upon the requirement of the operating unit. Diameter of the unit is 533 mm.  Service history  The torpedo is in service with the German Navy Type 212 submarines, has been delivered to the Pakistan Navy for service in the Agosta 90B submarines, has been selected by the Spanish Navy for its new S80A submarines and has been sold to other operators worldwide.

Whether the contest was purely legend or had some basis in an actual event has been debated since the Middle Ages. Local Thuringian historians, such as Dietrich von Apolda (1220 or 1230‚Äì1302) and Johannes Rothe (c.1360-1434), in the 14th and 15th centuries respectively, suggested the poems referred to an actual historical event. In the 19th century, Johann Rinne argued that the events never occurred. Medieval accounts of the S√§ngerkrieg The poems of the S√§ngerkrieg form an important collection of Middle High German literature, reflecting a literary flourishing at the court of Count Hermann I in the early 13th century. Both historical (Wolfram von Eschenbach and Walther von der Vogelweide) and fictional (Klingsor of Hungary and Heinrich von Ofterdingen) minstrels were alleged to have participated in the competition. Reinmar von Zweter, a historical Minnes√§nger, is anachronistically listed as a participant. The songs of the Wartburgkrieg have not been discovered in the original, but various versions can be found within the great Liederhandschriften of the late Middle Ages (the Codex Manesse, Jenaer Liederhandschrift, Kolmarer Liederhandschrift). A collection of lyrical poems entitled \\"Der S√§ngerkrieg auf der Wartburg\\", written between 1240 and 1260, was translated into modern German by Karl Simrock and published in 1858. Story of the S√§ngerkrieg The oldest poetic accounts, dating from the 13th century, describe specific episodes of the contest such as the F√ºrstenlob and the R√§tselspiel. The F√ºrstenlob (\\"princely praise\\") was a contest among six minstrels: Heinrich von Ofterdingen, Walther von der Vogelweide, Biterolf, Reinmar von Zweter, Wolfram von Eschenbach and Heinrich Schreiber. The six singers were placed before the Count and Countess of Thuringia, in order to determine which best understood how to sing praises of a prince. Heinrich von Ofterdingen was the most eloquent, but earned the envy of the other minstrels, who tricked him into earning a death sentence. Heinrich gained the protection of Countess Sophia and a one-year reprieve, during which he went to Hungary and sought the assistance of the sorcerer Klingsor. Heinrich and Klingsor returned to Thuringia to resume the contest. The R√§tselspiel (\\"mystery game\\") was the subsequent poetic duel between Wolfram von Eschenbach and the Hungarian sorcerer Klingsor. Wolfram proved himself capable and eloquent, and when Klingsor grew weary he summoned a demon to continue the duel. When Wolfram began to sing of the Christian mysteries, the demon was unable to respond. The S√§ngerkrieg in modern literature The history of the S√§ngerkrieg in modern literature begins in the 18th century with Johann Jakob Bodmer's Wiederentdeckung des Mittelalters (Rediscovery of the Middle Ages), which contained an account of the S√§ngerkrieg. Interest in the minstrels grew in popularity, as evidenced by the publication of ‚ÄúHeinrich von Ofterdingen‚Äù by Novalis in 1802. While Novalis did not describe the S√§ngerkrieg itself, the event was central to E. T. A. Hoffmanns Der Kampf der S√§nger (1818). An account of the contest could also be found in the Grimm Brothers' Deutsche Sagen (1816). One of the most famous interpretations is Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user und der S√§ngerkrieg auf Wartburg (1843). Wagner was the first to merge the Tannh√§user legend with the Wartburg S√§ngerkrieg. In Wagner's version, the S√§ngerkrieg is completely subordinated to the Tannh√§user story and the theme of release (Erl√∂sung). The mythical sorcerer Klingsor, as an adversary of Christian conviction, is the figure which made possible the blending of these stories, because he could also embody the same demonic forces which had trapped Tannh√§user under the spell of the Lady Venus. In the early 19th century, the Wartburg re-emerged as a German cultural symbol, and restoration work began in 1838. As part of this restoration, Moritz von Schwind painted frescoes in several parts of the castle between 1854 and 1856. The Minstrel Contest Fresco (S√§ngerstreitfresko) is the largest of them, making the viewer believe that he or she is actually witnessing the event. The inscription reads: ‚ÄúIn this hall the singer‚Äôs contest was held on the 7th of July 1207, for the birthday of Saint Elizabeth.‚Äù (‚ÄúIn diesem Saale wurde der S√§ngerstreit gehalten den 7ten Juli 1207, dem Geburtstag der Heil.

After seeing Marcel Marceau's historic 1956 performance at New York's Phoenix Theatre, Montanaro flew to Paris to study under Marceau and Marceau's teacher, Etienne Decroux. Career Montanaro had a long career of well-received performances in Europe and the United States. In 1962, he starred Off-Broadway in a one-man show called A Mime's Eye View at the Gramercy Arts Theatre.Lortel Archives. A Mime's Eye View Tony Montanaro.

February 22, 1973. He designed and hosted the award-winning CBS-TV children's show, \\"Pretendo\\". After performing and teaching around the world, Montanaro journeyed to another Paris -- South Paris, Maine, where in 1972, he founded the Celebration Barn Theater, a theater/school of mime, improvisation, storytelling and other performing skills. Celebration Barn alumni have gone on to careers in television, film and theater, including puppeteers with Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, writers for Between the Lions, hosting Dancing with the Stars, and as performers in Cirque du Soleil. Today, the Barn is an international residential center for theater training and creation, continuing Montanaro's legacy. Later Years In his later years, Montanaro continued to teach and direct at the Barn and at the renovated home and studios of he and his third wife, Karen Hurll Montanaro in Casco, Maine. The couple also toured widely with their two-person show, The Montanaro-Hurll Theatre of Mime and Dance. In 1995, the Montanaros authored Mime Spoken Here: The Performer's Portable Workshop, a guide to the craft of mime, character work, and improvisation, and a pair of accompanying instructional videos. Mr. Montanaro died at his home in Casco, on Friday, December 13, 2002. In 2004, thirty eight performers, all past students, came together for a series of concerts to honor their teacher. A 2006 film, Theatre & Inspiration, celebrates his life and contributions to the world of theatre.

It is popularly known as the Bear Symphony. Background The Chevalier de Saint-Georges, who conducted the premiere of the Symphony. The symphony was one of a series of six symphonies commissioned in 1786 by the Concert de la Loge Olympique, a popular concert subscription in Paris (hence the name for the series as a whole). Like the other Paris symphonies, \\"the Bear\\" was written for the largest orchestral ensemble that Haydn had written for up until that time, including reinforced woodwind parts and a large string section.W Lister, The First Performance of Haydn's ‚ÄòParis‚Äô Symphonies, Eighteenth-Century Music (2004), 1: 289-300 Despite its number, the symphony was actually the last of the six Paris symphonies to be composed. It was completed in 1786. It was first performed in 1787 in Paris by the Concert de la Loge Olympique, directed by the celebrated mulatto musician, Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint- Georges. Movements The work is in standard four movement form and scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, horns and/or trumpets, timpani, continuo (harpsichord) and strings. Early conflicting manuscript sources make the exact scoring for the brass unclear. Typically, however it is performed with both horns and trumpets.H.C. Robbins Landon, The Symphonies of Joseph Haydn. (London: Universal Edition and Rockliff, 1955) #Vivace assai, #Allegretto, in double variation form. #Menuet e Trio, #Finale: Vivace, File:Haydn-82-1-theme.png Nickname (The Bear) The symphony has long been popularly referred to as \\"the Bear\\". As with the nicknames of all Haydn's symphonies, it did not originate with the composer. Instead, the name derives from a recurring feature from the last movement (including its famous opening), in which Haydn intimates the tonality of a bagpipes or Dudelsack: a low sustained drone, accentuated by a grace-note on the downbeat. This curious tonality prompted an 1829 piano arrangement of the symphony to be entitled \\"Danse de l'Ours,\\" the earliest known printed appearance of the nickname.Bernard Harrison, Haydn: The \\"Paris\\" Symphonies (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p101 This is a reference to the music used to accompany dancing bears -- a popular form of street entertainment.Emanuel Winternitz, Bagpipes and Hurdy-Gurdies in Their Social Setting, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Summer, 1943), pp. 56-83 See also *List of symphonies by name Notes References *Bernard Harrison, Haydn: The \\"Paris\\" Symphonies (Cambridge University Press, 1998) *H.C.

A modern folding board made mostly of polypropylene. A folding boat is usually a smaller boat, typically ranging from about 2 to nearly . Folding boats can be carried by one or two persons, and comfortably fit into a car trunk when packed. They come in several varieties. There are folding kayaks and folding canoes. These types often use a wooden or aluminum frame and PVC or waterproof fabric for the hull. Other folding boats consist of plastic sheets or marine plywood, resembling origami. Although there is much to be said of the advantages of a folding boat, they are not commonplace in boating. Aluminium and inflatable alternatives are far more prevalent despite some folding boats such as the Seahopper having been sold for several decades. Sailing versions are particularly popular. Folding boats have been in use for some time with Shellbend folding boats being developed in the 1890s by Mellard Treleaven Reade. They were constructed from mahogany and canvas. Related types Traditional boats in the same category as folding boats include inflatable dinghies and small aluminium boats (tinnies). Inflatable boats try to solve the portability problem with an inflatable keel and side pods. This allows better storage and weight advantages. The main problems of these craft are that they are still quite heavy, they can puncture while on the water and can be time consuming to inflate and deflate for usage. Folding boats require in the order of 10 to 15 minutes to set up and put away but are much tougher than an inflatable craft, and may ultimately be smaller in storage as an inflatable boat may have hard board components for the floor. Aluminium boats cannot be disassembled, and the folding boat of space-age material is stronger than aluminium, while the strength to weight of some wooden ply is actually better than aluminium. The lower stiffness and rigidity may add to potential safety of a folding boat by allowing it to flex over waves. This stops the boat from the rocking effect of an inflexible boat. Powered Some folding boats have a transom for attaching an electric or petrol engine outboard. These are usually in the order of 2 - 4HP but can be up to 10HP. Electric motors are versatile on a folding boat and are well suited to calm water fishing due to low noise and weight.

Life He was born at Norwich, England, 6 December 1773; died London, 7 April 1837. His parents were Catholic converts. He entered the printing office of the Norfolk Chronicle as an apprentice. He rose to be editor of the paper, a post he held from 1799 to 1813. In 1813 he went to London to devote himself to advancing the Catholic cause by means of the press, and in July of that year he established the Orthodox Journal and Catholic Monthly Intelligencer. He was materially aided by Bishop John Milner, but in 1820 he was obliged to suspend publication. During this period he began the publication in Glasgow of a weekly pamphlet, The Catholic Vindicator, but its losses compelled him to abandon it after one year. With the assistance of Bishop Milner, he established in December 1820, a weekly newspaper, The Catholic Advocate of Civil and Religious Liberty, which was discontinued nine months later. In January 1822, two periodicals were established, one, The Catholic Miscellany, devoted to Catholic interests, with a nominal editor, but under the control of Andrews; the other, The People's Advocate, exclusively political, under his avowed editorship. The Advocate lived only seven weeks, and after two months the sole editorship of the other devolved on Andrews. He continued it for several months. In September 1824, he established a weekly paper, The Truth Teller, which lasted for twelve months, and was afterwards continued as a pamphlet, but finally discontinued in 1829 through lack of support. The Truth Teller was noted for the vigour with which it assailed Daniel O'Connell. On 2 April 1825, across the Atlantic, The Truth Teller began publication, as New York's first distinctly Catholic paper. There is no direct information extant as to whether the idea was to have it as a sort of local edition of the London publication. The first six issues, however, do bear the imprint of \\"William E. Andrews & Co.\\" as the publishers. Then the name of the publishing firm is changed to George Pardow and William Denman, without any reason being assigned. George Pardow was an English Catholic and so was Denman, both having emigrated to New York a few years before. In the early issues of the New York Truth Teller there are constant references to the work of Andrews in London, showing an intimate relationship, but never, however, giving any positive statement as to a business connection. Andrews again revived the Orthodox Journal, which he subsequently continued as The British Liberator, and later as Andrews's Constitutional Preceptor. From 1832 to 1834, he issued as a weekly paper, Andrews's Penny Orthodox Journal, which after three months became The London and Dublin Orthodox Journal. It was continued after his death by his son. In 1826 Andrews had established a society known as \\"The Friends of Civil and Religious Liberty\\", which in a little more than a year distributed nearly 500,000 tracts. This society was the parent of the \\"Metropolitan Tract Society\\" and many similar organizations.

Maia is the name of a fictional family, although some episodes fit into the history of the real Maia family. As early as 1878, while serving in the Portuguese consulate at Newcastle upon Tyne, E√ßa had at least given a name to this book and had begun working on it. It was mainly written during his residence in Bristol, and it was first published in 1888. The book largely concerns the life of young aristocrat Carlos da Maia in 1870s Portugal, when along with his best friend Jo√£o da Ega he spends his time making witticisms about society and having affairs. The novel uses the Monarchy's decline in Portugal (late 19th century), as a predominant theme, reflecting its author's own regret at his country's slow decay. The analysis of the book is compulsory for year 11 students in Portugal. Plot summary The book begins with the characters Carlos Eduardo da Maia, Jo√£o da Ega, Afonso da Maia and Vila√ßa in the family's old house with plans to reconstruct it. The house, nicknamed \\"Ramalhete\\" (bouquet), is located in Lisbon. Its name comes from a tiled panel depicting a bouquet of sunflowers set on the place where the stone with the coat of arms should be. As the introductory scene goes on, the story of the Maia family is given, in a flashback style by Afonso. Afonso da Maia, a Portuguese well- mannered man, is married to Maria Eduarda Runa and their marriage only produces one son ‚Äì Pedro da Maia. Pedro da Maia, who is given the typical romantic education, becomes a weak, low-spirited and sensitive man. He is very close to his mother and is inconsolable after her death. He only recuperates when he meets a beautiful woman called Maria Monforte with whom he gets married despite his father's objection. The marriage produces a son, Carlos Eduardo, and a daughter, whose name is not revealed until much later. Some time later, Maria Monforte falls in love with Tancredo (an Italian who is staying at their house after being accidentally wounded by Pedro) and runs away to Italy with him, betraying Pedro and taking her daughter along. When Pedro finds out, he is heartbroken and goes with his son to his father's house where he, during the night, commits suicide. Carlos stays at his grandfather's house and is educated by him, receiving the typical British education (as Afonso would have liked to have raised his son). Now back to the present, Carlos is a wealthy, elegant gentleman who is a doctor and opens his own office. Later he meets a gorgeous woman at the Hotel Central during a dinner organized by Jo√£o da Ega (his friend and accomplice from University who lives with Carlos) in honor of Baron Cohen, the director of the National Bank. After many comical and disastrous adventures he finally discovers the woman's name ‚Äì Maria Eduarda, and ends up meeting her. The two fall in love and have dozens of nights together, drinking and having sex. However, the two start seeing each other in secret after an incident where a redneck-like man named D√¢maso, Carlo's ex-friend and rival, writes an article in a newspaper, accusing, humiliating, making fun of and revealing the past of Carlos and Maria. Eventually Carlos finds out that Maria lied to him about her past and he starts fearing the worst. Mr. Guimar√£es, a good friend of Maria's mother and an uncle-like figure to her, talks to Ega and gives him a box meant to be given \\"to your friend Carlos... or to his sister!\\". Ega doesn't understand this statement, because Carlos supposedly never had a sister. Ega is horrified and in state of shock when he realizes that Maria is Carlos's sister. Ega, in despair, tells everything to Vila√ßa (the Maia family attorney) who informs Carlos about the incest. Carlos informs his dying grandfather, and Afonso becomes shocked by this news. However, Carlos cannot forget his love and doesn't say anything to Maria. Afonso dies because of apoplexy. At last, Carlos informs his newfound sister that they are siblings and that they cannot live like this anymore. Maria says one last goodbye to her former lover and to her friends before going away to an unknown future. Carlos, to forget his tragedies, goes on a trip around the world. The book ends with a famous scene in Portugal, where Carlos returns to Lisbon 10 years after he left. He meets Ega and combie a boys-only night to have fun together. At one point, they agree that there is nothing in the world that is worth running for. Ironically, as soon as they go out to the street, they realize that they missed the last cable car and they start running after it, shouting \\"We can still catch it, we can still catch it...!\\", closing the story in a both philosophical and comic way. Translations The first English translation, by Patricia McGowan Pinheiro and Ann Stevens was published in 1965 by St. Martins Press. In 2007 Dedalus Books published a new English translation by Margaret Jull Costa which won the 2008 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. Film, TV and theatrical adaptations In 2001 Rede Globo produced their acclaimed adaptation of Os Maias (including some elements from E√ßa's short novel The Relic) as a short soap-opera type serial in 40 chapters, which was shown from Tuesday to Friday during a ten-week period. It starred a very select group of Brazilian actors, most of them with long careers on TV, theatre and cinema. The screenplay was adapted by the renowned soap opera writer Maria Adelaide Amaral and directed by Luiz Fernando Carvalho. This is considered one of the most outstanding Globo productions in terms of photographic and overall artistic quality, but failed miserably, with low television ratings (often lower than a 9% audience share). Other adaptations Paula Rego painted a series of pastels, inspired by this novel, which have been exhibited in London.

Biography Early nicknamed \\"the little prophet\\" for his gift of repeating to perfection with gestures the sermons he had heard. He studied at Gimont then Toulouse before becoming a priest. He twice won the prize for an Ode from the Academy of Floral Games and gave himself to the ministry of preaching. He began so successfully that he received the nickname of \\"Little prophet\\" which he always retained. Noticed by the Marquis de Montespan, who chose him as tutor of his son the Marquis d'Antin, his sermons brought him quickly a solid reputation as a religious speaker in the capital. In 1681 the French Academy chose him to write the introduction of a Panegyric in praise of Saint Louis and thereafter was heard in all the parishes of the capital. Two years later he preached at court: the days of the Last Supper and of Pentecost. In 1698 he preached Advent and Lent. In 1709 he brought his long career to an end. In one of her letters (8 April 1689) Madame de Sevigne noted his intelligence, his eloquence, his charm, and his devotion and said of him: \\"There is hardly any other preacher that I think I should prefer than him\\".

He served as Attorney General of Hong Kong for 4 years. He also wrote pamphlets on legal and political topics, particularly those relevant to Roman Catholics. Early life He was the second son of Thomas Anstey (1777‚Äì1851) and his wife Mary Turnbull, born in Kentish Town, London. In 1823, his father, a lawyer who had gone into commerce, moved to Tasmania, and he followed in 1827 with his elder brother George Alexander (1814‚Äì1895). In his early education he studied Hebrew with the minister James Garrett. Anstey returned to England, intending to take up law, and was educated at school in Wellington, Somerset and at University College London. He came under the influence of the Tractarians, and also entered the Middle Temple, being called to the bar in 1839. He had become a Catholic convert, married that year, and moved with his wife to Hobart, Tasmania. He became a Catholic leader there, and achieved prominence for a court appearance (R. v. Espie, 1840). But he lost a position as commissioner of insolvent estates after a few months. Returning to England, Anstey took an appointment as Professor of Law and Jurisprudence at Prior Park College, Bath. By 1846 he had turned his attention to politics, and resigned.Norton-Kyshe, History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong, p367-8 citing a biographical notice Political career Anstey favoured the repeal of the Union both with Ireland and Scotland. He was a Liberal in English politics, but Walker classifies him as an Irish Confederate candidate when he was elected Member of Parliament for the Irish constituency of Youghal in 1847. He was not renominated at Youghal in 1852, but contested Bedford in the general election of that year.Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801-1922, edited by B.M.

Stenton (The Harvester Press 1976) An opponent of Lord Palmerston, Anstey often worked with David Urquhart as ally in foreign policy issues. On first entering politics in 1846, he aligned with the more radical followers of Daniel O'Connell, who died in 1847, and supported William Smith O'Brien. Legal career On Anstey's return to England, he joined the Northern Circuit before moving to practice at the Chancery Bar. After he dropped out of Parliament, in 1855, he was appointed Attorney General of Hong Kong and served in that capacity until 1859. His attempts to enforce building regulations on Chinese merchants led in 1858 to a strike, retrospectively named the \\"Anstey Riots\\". Anstey left Hong Kong in 1859, having fallen out with the Governor Sir John Bowring.Norton- Kyshe, History of the Laws and Courts of Hong Kong, Chap XXV and XXVI. He went to Bombay (now Mumbai) where at times he acted Judge of the High Court of Bombay in 1865. He came back to England in 1866 and in a tract entitled A Plea for the Unrepresented for the Restitution of the Franchise advocated universal suffrage as a panacea for the ills resulting from class legislation. In 1867 he published an attack on Benjamin Disraeli's Reform Act of that year. In 1868 Anstey returned to Bombay and resumed his practice as a barrister.

Southern section Bare Mountain The southernmost of the M&M; Trail traverse a northern section of the trap rock Metacomet Ridge which extends from Long Island Sound to the Massachusetts/ Vermont border. This ridge, rising hundreds of feet above the Connecticut River Valley in Massachusetts, is a prominent landscape feature. Mount Tom, at above sea level and with vertical cliff faces of several hundred feet, is the high point. From south to north, the M&M; Trail uses the ridges of Provin Mountain, East Mountain, the Mount Tom Range, and the Holyoke Range. Abrupt vertical cliffs with visible talus slopes and frequent viewpoints are common throughout. Views are generally to the west on Provin Mountain, East Mountain, and the Mount Tom ranges; and to the north on the Holyoke Range. The Connecticut River cuts through the ridgeline between the Mount Tom and Holyoke ranges in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and the Westfield River separates Provin Mountain from East Mountain in Westfield. Historic features along the trail include the Horse Caves on Mount Norwottuck, the ruins of the 19th-century hotel Eyrie House on Mount Nonotuck, and the refurbished Mount Holyoke Summit House on Mount Holyoke. The Mount Holyoke Summit House has been restored as a museum, open during weekends in the summer. The trap rock ridges and talus slopes are also home to several unique microclimate ecosystems that support species of plants that are unusual or endangered in this part of New England, and are a seasonal migration path for raptors.Farnsworth, Elizabeth J. (2004).\\"Metacomet- Mattabesett Trail Natural Resource Assessment.\\" , Retrieved November 20, 2007.

Northern section Summit view of Grand Monadnock on a July weekend. More than 125,000 people hike this peak each year, making it the most frequently climbed mountain in the United States. Where open to public access, the remaining of trail follows an elevated plateau of 400 million year old metamorphic rock punctuated by occasional monadnocks.Raymo, Chet and Raymo, Maureen E. (1989). Written in Stone: A Geologic History of the Northeastern United States. Chester, Connecticut: Globe Pequot. The terrain is a rural and largely wooded, post- glacial landscape with sparse viewpoints, deep ravines, and a few bare mountain summits. The trail follows the western edge of this plateau in a northerly direction, then jogs east along the Massachusetts/New Hampshire border before turning north again to reach Mount Monadnock. Prominent features on or easily accessible from this part of the M&M; Trail include, from south to north, Rattlesnake Gutter (a boulder-filled chasm), Ruggles Pond in Wendell State Forest, the Millers River, Farley Ledges, Briggs Brook Falls, Northfield Mountain and reservoir (a hydroelectric reservoir carved out of a mountain top), the historic Hermit Cave, Crag Mountain, Mount Grace, Highland Falls, and Royalston Falls. In New Hampshire, the trail crosses the summits of Little Monadnock Mountain (in Rhododendron State Park), Gap Mountain, and Mount Monadnock. All three of these peaks have exposed summit ledges. Mount Monadnock is the most prominent peak of southeast New England. At high, it is higher than any mountain peak within and rises above the surrounding landscape. Its bare, rocky summit provides expansive views. Trail communities The M&M; Trail passes through land located within the following incorporated towns. In Massachusetts (from south to north): Southwick, Agawam, Westfield, West Springfield, Holyoke, Easthampton, Hadley, South Hadley, Amherst, Granby, Belchertown, Pelham, Shutesbury, Leverett, Wendell, Erving, Northfield, Warwick, Royalston; and in New Hampshire: Richmond, Fitzwilliam, Troy, and Jaffrey. History Eyre House ruins on the summit of Mount Nonotuck of the Mount Tom Range The Metacomet-Monadnock Trail receives its name from the Metacomet Trail in Connecticut, of which it is a logical extension, and from Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire. The name Metacomet is derived from Metacom, the 17th-century Native American leader and son of Massasoit of the Wampanoag tribe of southern New England. The term Monadnock is an Abenaki-derived word used to describe a mountain. It has come to be used by American geologists to describe any isolated mountain formed from the exposure of a harder rock as a result of the erosion of a softer rock that once surrounded it. The M&M; Trail was designed in the 1950s by the late Professor Walter M. Banfield of the University of Massachusetts Amherst as an extension of the Metacomet Trail in Connecticut. The route was constructed utilizing newly blazed paths, abandoned farm roads, and existing hiking trails (many of them several hundred years old) where available. Portions of the route on Mount Monadnock and the Holyoke and Mount Tom ranges date back as far as the 18th century. Early trail-building was supported by various summit resort hotels popular in the 19th century. Such resorts once stood on Mount Holyoke, Mount Nonotuck, Mount Tom, and Mount Monadnock (at the Halfway House site). Most of them had burned down or had become defunct by the early 20th century and never recovered. Encroaching development and modern transportation hastened the demise of these businesses by shifting tourism to more remote and exotic locations. Many of these properties were eventually bought, taken, or donated for inclusion in various state parks.Mt. Holyoke Range Historical Timeline. Retrieved November 20, 2007.Baldwin, Henry I. Monadnock Guide 4th ed. (1989). Concord, New Hampshire: Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. The terminus of the trail, Mount Monadnock, barren from to its summit and known for its fine views and rugged topography, was once mostly wooded. Fires deliberately set in the early 19th century by nearby farmers concerned with wolves denning in blowdown snags resulted in the denudation of the mountain. The fires burned so hot that the soil was destroyed and subsequently washed away. Since then, the summit has recovered to the degree that it appears natural and scenic, although it is still very barren and reminiscent of the alpine peaks of the White Mountains to the north. Vegetation has begun to slowly reclaim some of the ledges and ravines, but the process of soil generation on windy slopes will likely take many hundreds of years. As described in #Conservation and maintenance of the trail corridor below, the M&M; Trail is part of the New England National Scenic Trail. Landscape, geology, and natural environment This glacial erratic is located on the M&M; trail about one mile north of Mass State Highway 141. The geology and natural environment of the M&M; trail can be divided into two distinct sections: the Metacomet Ridge of the Pioneer Valley and the upland plateau of central Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. One common denominator, evidence of recent glacial activity, can be found throughout all parts of the M&M; Trail. Such evidence includes glacial erratics, glacial scouring, glacial striations, deranged drainage, mountain notches, U-shaped valleys, highland swamps, and roches moutonn√©es, so called \\"sheepback mountains\\" because they often resemble the shape of a sheep in profile. The extremely steep south and/or east faces of these hills were carved by the movement of glacial ice down lee slopes. The Metacomet Ridge Snake Pond, a kettle pond along the M&M; Trail on trap rock East Mountain The ridge that forms the spine of the M&M; Trail across Provin Mountain, East Mountain, and the Mount Tom and Holyoke ranges was formed 200 million years ago during the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods and is composed of trap rock, also known as basalt, an extrusive volcanic rock. Basalt is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique \\"postpile\\" appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured basalt talus are visible beneath many of the ledges; they are particularly visible along the Metacomet- Monadnock Trail on Bare Mountain. The basalt ridges are the product of several massive lava flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa. These basalt floods of lava happened over a period of 20 million years. Erosion occurring between the eruptions deposited deep layers of sediment between the lava flows, which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock. The resulting \\"layer cake\\" of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today. One way to imagine this is to picture a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between. One of the best places to view this layer-cake structure is just beneath the summit of Mount Norwottuck. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. The Horse Caves are located a short distance off the M&M; Trail via the Robert Frost Trail. The sedimentary rock of the Connecticut River Valley is also well known for its fossils, especially dinosaur tracks, which have been discovered in several locations near the ridges that the M&M; Trail traverses. The Metacomet Ridge hosts a combination of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent Berkshire plateau containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Many bogs, ponds, and reservoirs lie cupped between trap rock ridge shelves, demonstrating the value of these ridges as important aquifers and wetland ecosystem habitats. Because the trap rock ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare. Other ecosystems on the southern sections of the M&M; Trail include the northern riverine community which supports species such as willow, American elm, and sycamore; this ecosystem can be found along the Westfield and Connecticut rivers.Kricher, John (1998).

Royalston Falls, on the M&M; Trail near the New Hampshire border The upland plateau North of the Holyoke Range, the M&M; Trail traverses an upland plateau composed of much older metamorphic rock, mostly schist, gneiss and quartzite. The plateau, averaging above sea level, is geologically related to the higher White Mountains of New Hampshire, farther to the north. The terrain is rugged, with deep ravines and isolated mountain peaks called monadnocks. Notable monadnocks along the M&M; Trail include Mount Grace and Mount Monadnock. Other mountains on this section of the M&M; Trail, including Mt. Lincoln, Mt. Orient, and Northfield Mountain, represent high points on the steeply ravined edges of a dissected plateau. The upland plateau section of the M&M; Trail supports transitional forests of species common to both the oak-hickory and northern hardwood forest types. Ravines support significant stands of eastern hemlock, and stands of white pine are common throughout. Tree and shrub species also include sugar maple; red maple; gray, black, paper, and yellow birch; white ash; black oak and red oak; striped maple; mountain laurel; and, on exposed dry ledges, pitch pine. Northern boreal species, particularly red spruce, become apparent on peaks in the northern part of the M&M; Trail. The high, exposed ledges of Mount Monadnock support several alpine and sub-alpine species of plants, including mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. The northernmost stand of native rhododendron (growing naturally, not planted) in eastern North America is located just off the M&M; Trail on Little Monadnock Mountain in Rhododendron State Park, New Hampshire. Politics, policy and re-routing North of the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, portions of the M&M; Trail are currently discontinued due to the requests of private landowners, the largest of which is the Paul C.

Currently, the Appalachian Mountain Club is negotiating with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation to relocate approximately of the trail. Hiking the trail View from Mount Holyoke ledges The trail is blazed with white rectangles. It is regularly maintained, and is considered easy hiking, with sections of rugged and moderately difficult hiking along the Holyoke and Mount Tom ranges.Massachusetts and Rhode Island Trail Guide. (1989). Boston: Appalachian Mountain Club. Mount Monadnock is regarded as a challenging hike for novice hikers during favorable weather conditions. Guidebooks recommend hikers take a map and compass. Hikers should contact the Berkshire Section of the AMC or review on-line updates for the latest trail relocations. As the crow flies, the M&M; Trail route is never more than a mile or two from a public road; however, cliffs and steep terrain on the Metacomet Ridge and on Mount Monadnock and other peaks make access much more difficult in some areas. There are several primitive lean-tos and campsites, and a few state park campsites with facilities along the trail. However, camping is discouraged in many areas. Campfires are generally prohibited, except in established fire rings in state park campgrounds. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook with topographic maps is published by the Appalachian Mountain Club. Weather along the route is typical of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire, with slightly warmer temperatures in the Connecticut River Valley versus the upland plateau to the east. Conditions on exposed hill tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA. Retrieved December 20, 2007. Weather atop the exposed and isolated summit of Mount Monadnock can be much more severe than conditions below; high winds are common year round and winter storms on the summit can be life-threatening. Lightning is a hazard on exposed peaks and ledges during thunderstorms. High flooding is common during rainy periods on the portions of trail that dip into the Connecticut River Valley and the Westfield River Valley, sometimes obliterating the trail. The Westfield River can be forded only during dry periods, and even then not without risk. The Connecticut River is not fordable; the trail terminates where it meets it (one must walk or drive to the Northampton Route 9 bridge or arrange for boat passage to the opposite bank). Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of cross country skis or snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Snow and ice tend to linger on Mount Monadnock well into the spring. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a hazard. The trail passes through black bear habitat (especially the northern portions), although problems with bears are rare. More likely are problematic encounters with feral and domestic dogs. Skunks, raccoons, and porcupines are common and active after dark. Venomous snakes are considered extinct along most of the route, with the possible exception of the warm, dry microclimates on the Metacomet Ridge. Poison ivy is native to the M&M; Trail ecosystems, but it occurs with less frequency north of the Holyoke Range, and does not thrive on Mount Monadnock at all.Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Retrieved December 6, 2007. Many water sources along the trail flow through inhabited areas or swamps and may be contaminated. Except during the winter, trap rock ridges tend to be dry, leaving long stretches of trail with no dependable water source. Various portions along the trail are road walks due to private ownership; contacting the AMC will provide the latest updates. Hikers seeking 'on the ground', current information regarding the status of the M&M; trail should read hiker journals available on the Internet, such as Trail Journals.comhttp://www.trailjournals.com/journals.cfm?sort=&year;=2013&trail;=other#Metacomet- Monadnock%20Trail Conservation and maintenance of the trail corridor 200px Round Mountain by quarrying. 1989 photo; significantly more rock has been removed since then.

Significant threats to the trail, its ecosystems, and its viewshed included quarrying (especially on the trap rock ridges) and suburban sprawl. The Metacomet- Monadnock Trail is maintained by volunteer efforts largely facilitated by the Berkshire Chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club. Many groups are invested in preserving the pathway and viewshed of the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail, including The Trustees of Reservations, Mount Grace Land Conservation Trust, Friends of the Mt.

During his mission, he also met with Muslim princes such as the uncle of the prince of Aleppo, and the brother of the prince of Mossul, who were on their way to pay their own respects to the Khan. The princes invited Ascelin to travel further east with them to meet the Great Khan in Karakorum, Mongolia, but he declined the offer. Ascelin carried Baiju's reply, a missive which demanded the submission of the Pope, back to Europe. He was accompanied by two Mongolian envoys, A√Øbeg and Serkis, who traveled with him back to Lyon and met with Innocent in 1248.Rene Grousset, Histoire des Croisades, p. 522 In response, the pope issued the papal bull Viam agnoscere veritatis, which appealed to the Mongols that they should stop killing Christians.Rachewiltz, p. 118.Roux, Histoire de l'Empire Mongol, p.316: \\"Sergis et Aibeg were finally sent back on November 22, 1248, with an answer, known as Viam agnoscere veritatis\\" (Original French quote: \\"Serbeg et Aibeg furent finalement cong√©di√©s le 22 Novembre 1248 avec une r√©ponse, la lettre connue comme Viam agnoscere veritatis\\").

Some were and high. This oil came from the sacred grove of Athena at Akademia. The amphorae which held it had the distinctive form of tight handles, narrow neck and feet, and they were decorated with consistent symbols, in a standard form using the black figure technique, and continued to be so, long after the black figure style had fallen out of fashion. Some Panathenaic amphorae depicted Athena Promachos, goddess of war, advancing between columns brandishing a spear and wearing the aegis, and next to her the inscription \\"(one) of the prizes from Athens\\". On the back of the vase was a representation of the event for which it was an award. Sometimes roosters are depicted perched on top of the columns. The significance of the roosters remains a mystery. Later amphorae also had that year's archon's name written on it making finds of those vases archaeologically important. The Burgon amphora ca. 565 BCE, BM, London The vases were commissioned by the state from the leading pottery workshops of the day in large numbers. Their canonical shape was set by 530 BCE, but the earliest known example is the Burgon amphora (British Museum, B130), which depicts Athena's owl nestling on the neck of the vase and on the reverse is a synoris team. This may mean that the vase predates the festival's reorganization in 566 since it is not an athletic event. The cock column is first seen on a panathenaic by Exekias (Karlsruhe 65.45). By the early fourth century the inclusion of the archon's name appears on these vases, the earliest almost intact one being Asteios 373/2 BCE. (Oxford, 1911.257). There is a fragment that bears the name Hippodamas of 375/4 BCE, however, which may also be a panathenaic, and Beazley suggests there may be a preceding one, Pythokles of 392/1.J. D. Beazley: Development of Attic Black-Figure, 1986, p. 89. As the century progressed the profile of the vases became elongated and the decoration more mannered. The last known dated vase is from 312/11, although production continues into the third and second centuries, the archons are no longer named, instead, the treasurers and stewards of the games are recorded in their place. Some vases were used as grave goods by the families of the victors, some were dedicated to sanctuaries, and still others sold,The public record of the goods sold off by the state after Alcibiades's disgrace has been partially preserved, IG I3 422.21, 41-60, includes mention of 102 panathenaics, Broadman (ABFV, p.170) suggests these sold for on average half a drachma each. See also AW Johnston, Trade Marks on Greek Vases, 1979. hence their wide distribution in the Greek world. The survival rate of Greek pottery as a whole may be calculated from the remnant of panathenaic amphorae that exist. After approximately 350 BCE at least 1450 vases were awarded every four years in the greater Panathenaia. Assuming the number of events was consistent throughout the history of the games and that all prizes were in the form of decorated amphora, dividing the number of unique vases known by the total production run, gives the figure of between 0.5% and 1% of all Greek vases awarded are still extantR.

Life Born near Troyes, he entered the Society of Jesus while St. Ignatius was still living, and was regarded as one of the most eloquent men of his time. Mathew calls him the \\"Chrysostom of France\\". Wherever he went, throngs flocked to hear him, and the heretics themselves were always eager to be present, captivated as they were by the charm of his wisdom and the delicacy of his courtesy in their regard. His entrance into France as a priest was in the city of Valence, where the bishop had just apostatized, and the Calvinists were then in possession. The efforts of Auger to address the people were followed by his being seized and sentenced to be burned to death. While standing on the pyre, he harangued the multitude, and so won their good will they asked for his deliverance. Pierre Viret, especially, the chief orator of the Calvinists, wanted to have a public discussion with him to convert him. Auger was consequently sent to prison for the night, but the Catholics rescued him before the conference took place. Later he was in Lyons, during a pestilence, devoting himself to the plague-stricken. When the pest had ceased, in consequence of a vow he made, the authorities, in gratitude, established a college of the Society to which Auger asked much to their astonishment, that the children of the Calvinists might be admitted. His whole life was one of constant activity, preaching and administering the responsible offices of Provincial, Rector etc., that were entrusted to him. He was finally made confessor of king Henry III, the first Jesuit to have that troublesome charge put upon him. The difficulty of his position was increased by the fact that the League was just then being formed by the Catholic succession. Its principles and methods were sought to trench on the royal prerogative; but Sixtus V was in favour of it. Several Jesuits, notably the Provincial, Mathieu, who was deposed by Acquaviva, were its stanch upholders. Auger's position was intolerable. Loyal to the king, he was detested by the leaguers who at Lyons, the city that he had saved, threatened to throw him into the Rhone. They compromised by expelling him from the city. The general commanded him to relinquish the post of confessor, but the King secured the pope's order for him to stay. Finally Auger prevailed on the monarch to release him, he withdrew to Como in Italy, where he died. Shortly afterwards Henry was assassinated. Works Like Canisius in Germany, Auger published a Catechism for France. It appeared at first in Latin, and later he published it in Greek. He wrote a work on the Blessed Eucharist, instructions for soldiers, translations, some literary compositions, and also drew up the statutes for congregations, especially one in which the king was interested, called the Congregation of Penitents. There is a letter by him called \\"Spiritual Sugar\\", though he did not give it that title. He had written an address to the people of Toulouse to console them in the distress brought on by the calamities of the authorities of the civil war. It so took the popular fancy that authorities of the city published it under this curious caption.

Its residents are Magyars, with minority of Serbs. The Serbian Kovin Monastery, the oldest in Hungary and one of two in the Diocese of Buda of the Serbian Orthodox Church, was built in 1487 in the centre of R√°ckeve. Also in central R√°ckeve is the Savoy Castle of Prince Eugene of Savoy, built in the baroque style in 1702‚Äì50. History The town hall of R√°ckeve Serb Orthodox Church From Year 1487. Serb Orthodox Church Paintings After the √Årp√°d dynasty was established, the region of today's R√°ckeve belonged to the Hungarian king. In the Middle Ages, there was a settlement here called √Åbrah√°mtelke, and also a monastery built in the 12th century, mentioned in official document in 1212 the first time. In the 15th century many Serb refugees came from the South, fleeing the invasions of the Ottoman Turks. In this time, the settlement was called Kiskeue, that is to say \\"Kiskeve\\" in modern Hungarian. Kiskeve means \\"Little Keve\\" in English, and the Serbs in the town called it Mali Kovin = \\"Lesser Kovin\\", or Gornji Kovin (\\"Upper Kovin\\") in contrast with the name of other Kovin (Donji Kovin / \\"Lower Kovin\\") in the South, where the Serbs had fled from. In the 16th century, R√°ckeve was a respectable mercantile town. The Calvinist variant of Protestantism was spread in the town by Szegedi Kis Istv√°n. In 1541, the town fell under Ottoman rule, and most of its population fled towards North. Many Serbs who used to live in the town settled in Gy≈ër and Kom√°rom. Those who stayed in the town elected a \\"duke\\" called ƒêurƒëe (1543‚Äì46). In 1567, the town was populated by (mostly Calvinist) Hungarians and Serbs. In 1698, after the expulsion of the Turkish, the whole of Csepel Island (Csepel-sziget), and thus R√°ckeve too, became the land of the victorious Prince Eugene of Savoy. The new landlord had his mansion built in this settlement; it can be visited by prior appointment. In the 18th century, the arrival of German settlers increased the number of inhabitants in the town. Thus the settlement became a tri-ethnic location with Hungarians, Serbs and Germans. Their descendants still refer to the place as Srpski Kovin or Ratzenmarkt. The end of the 19th century, the Millennium period represented a great upswing in the life of the town. At that time, the original wooden bridge was replaced by a permanent iron bridge and the decision was taken to build a new town hall, which was later erected in the Secession style on the site of the original. A renowned angling paradise, Angelic Island divides the Danube branch here. The holiday resort areas have been developed in the 1970s, at the same time the hot water spa and lido were also established. City status was granted again to R√°ckeve in 1984. Name The Name of R√°ckeve in today's form derives from the Hungarian words r√°c and keve. R√°c is a name formerly used in Hungarian to designate Serbs, who lived, among other, in the medieval Serbian region of Ra≈°ka (), that became the second designation for medieval Serbia, since the end of the 12th century. Keve means cemetery in medieval Hungarian. In pre-modern Hungarian it also meant little stone, or pebble, that was put on tombs. There is also a theory that the word keve is of Hunnic origin and it was the name of one of the leaders of Attila in the 4th century. Since the 19th century, the name Keve has been used as a personal name among Hungarians, due to the traditional theories among Hungarians on Hun-Hungarian historical relations. The Serbs named the place after the town of Kovin in Banat (Vojvodina in Serbia) whence most inhabitants had fled to settle in R√°ckeve. In Serbian, R√°ckeve is known as –ì–æ—Ä—ö–∏ –ö–æ–≤–∏–Ω / Gornji Kovin (\\"Upper Kovin\\"), –ú–∞–ª–∏ –ö–æ–≤–∏–Ω / Mali Kovin (\\"Lesser Kovin\\"), or Srpski Kovin / –°—Ä–ø—Å–∫–∏ –ö–æ–≤–∏–Ω (\\"Serbian Kovin\\"). This is to contrast it in Serbian language with the name of the original town in Vojvodina, known as just Kovin in Serbian and Keve in Hungarian. The Serbian word Kovin comes from the root \\"–∫–æ–≤-\\" / \\"kov-\\" = \\"smith\\" (cf. –∫–æ–≤–∞—á / kovaƒç = ironsmith; –∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ / kovnica = \\"copper mint\\" –∫–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ / kovanica = \\"coin\\" –ø–æ—Ç–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ü–∞ / potkovica = \\"horseshoe\\" etc.) Sights R√°ckeve is famous for the only Gothic style Serb Orthodox Church in Hungary from the 15th century. The Catholic church was designed by Patay L√°szl√≥. The Fresco-secco in the church is worth seeing. The Calvinist church is built in neo-gothic style in 1913. There is also an √Årp√°d Museum. There is Hungary's only authentic old Ship mill. It was built only from donations and operated by \\"R√°ckevei Moln√°r C√©h\\" (R√°ckeve Miller Guild). This is the most visited attraction in the city. Savoy Castle The Savoy Castle of Prince Eugene of Savoy in central R√°ckeve was built in the baroque style in 1702-1750.

He worked in the Portuguese consular service, stationed at 53 Grey Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, from late 1874 until April 1879. The novel was written during this productive period in his career, appearing in 1878. A bowdlerized translation of this book by Mary Jane Serrano under the title Dragon's Teeth: A Novel was published in the United States in 1889,See Preface to 1889 translation. still available as a print-on- demand title. More accurate translations have since been published, first in 1953 by the poet Roy Campbell (1992 reprint of 1953 trans.) and then in 2003 by award-winning translator Margaret Jull Costa. Plot Jorge, a successful engineer and employee of a ministry and Lu√≠sa, a romantic and dreamy girl, star as the typical bourgeois couple of the Lisbon society of the 19th century. There is a group of friends who attend the home of Jorge and Lu√≠sa: D. Felicidade (Dr. Happiness), a woman suffering from gas crises and is in love with the Councillor; Sebasti√£o (Sebastian), a close friend of Jorge; Councillor Acacio, good scholar; Ernestinho; and maids Joana - hussy and flirty - and Juliana - angry, envious, spiteful and bitter woman, responsible for the conflict of the novel. At the same time cultivating a formal and happy marriage with Jorge, Louise still maintains friendship with a former colleague, Leopoldina - called \\"Bread and Cheese\\" for her continuous betrayal and adultery. Lu√≠sa's happiness and safety become endangered when Jorge need to travel to work at Alentejo. After the departure of her husband, Lu√≠sa is bored with nothing to do, in the doldrums and melancholy caused by the absence of her husband, and exactly in this meantime Bazilio comes from abroad. A womanizer and a \\"bon vivant\\", he doesn't take long to win the love of Luisa (they had date before Luisa meet Jorge). Lu√≠sa was a person with a strong romantic view of life as she usually read only novels, and Bazilio was the man of her dreams: he was rich and lived in France. The friendly love became an ardent passion and this causes Luisa to practice adultery. Meanwhile, Juliana is just waiting for a chance to blackmail Luisa. Luisa and Bazilio send love letters to one another, but one of these letters is intercepted by maid Juliana - who starts blackmailing Luisa. Turned from a spoiled lady into a slave, Luisa starts to become sick. The ill-treatment she suffers from Juliana quickly takes her liveliness, undermining her health. Jorge comes back and is not suspicious, as Luisa satisfies every whim of the maid while looking for all possible solutions until she finds the disinterested help of Sebastian, who sets a trap for Juliana, trying to get her arrested and ends up causing her death. It's a new era for Luisa, surrounded by the affection of Jorge, Joan and the new maid, Mariana. However, it is too late: weakened by life that had endured under the tyranny of Juliana, Luisa is affected by a violent fever. Luisa does not notice that Bazilio hasn't replied to her letters for months, and when the postman delivers the letter at her home, it grabs Jorge's attention due to it being addressed to Luisa and being sent from France. He reads the letter and discovers the adultery of his wife. The evidence of her betrayal makes him go into despair but nevertheless, he forgives her because of the strong love he feels for Luisa and due to her fragile health. The affection and care of her husband, friends and the doctor are useless: Luisa dies. After that, Jorge dismisses the maids and moves with Sebastian. Bazilio returns to Lisbon - where he had fled, leaving Luisa without support - and as he learns of Luisas's death, he cynically comments to a friend: \\"If I had brought Alphonsine before.\\" This part closes the book revealing that Bazilio is a mean person. As they walk down the street, his friend Visconde Reinaldo admonished Bazilio for having an affair with a \\"bourgeois\\". He also said he found the relationship \\"absurd\\", after all and told that Bazilio had done what he made for \\"hygiene\\". Bazilio confirms his suspicions. Luisa had been used then. There was no feeling. Luisa died, so without ever being loved by him.

It was one of the most famous and successful youth systems for rugby league and produced some of the best players in both rugby league and rugby union. The Bradford Bulls Youth Development consisted of three main teams, the Senior Academy, the Junior Academy and the Service Area team. Youth Development system also included scouting for the local area and education for the players in the academy teams. The Academy The Senior Academy (from 2013 the Under 19's) was the highest tier in the Youth Development system. Any players under the age of 19 years were eligible to play for the senior academy; the rules also permitted three players over the age of 21 to play in academy matches. Most of the team was made up of fringe squad players and those first team players recovering from injury but also some of the best players from the junior academy were given experience in the senior academy. The Bradford Bulls Senior Academy was one of the best in the country and produced more professional Rugby League players than any other Academy in the country. The success of the Bradford Bulls Academy decreased in its latter years, many Senior Academy players were promoted to the first team squad at quite a young age and either secured a first team places or were released to other clubs. This meant that players from the junior academy players were drafted into the senior academy but were often playing against opposition much older than themselves.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Oppido Mamertina. The municipality includes the following boroughs (frazioni): Castellace, Messignadi, Piminoro, and Tresilico. History The ancient history of the town is largely unknown, but archeological excavations in Mella might point its origins to the mythical Mamerto (3rd century BC ‚Äì 1st century AD). The first mention of the town (Oppidum in Latin, meaning citadel) is 1040, during the Byzantine Era. The town is famous for its prolonged resistance before falling to Roger the Norman in 1056. On February 5, 1783, an earthquake completely destroyed the town killing 1,198 people.Faulting and earthquake triggering during the 1783 Calabria seismic sequence, Jacques E., Monaco C., Tapponnier P., Tortorici L. & Winter T., Geophysical Journal International, Volume 147, Number 3, 2002, pp.499-516 The town was rebuilt near the neighbouring village Tresilico (incorporated in the municipality in 1927). Other earthquakes hit the town in 1894 and on December 28, 1908, which destroyed the neighbouring township Castellace. Economy The economy is based on agriculture, in particular olive groves and the production of olive oil, as well citrus orchards in the plain. Forestry and sheep husbandry are also sources of income. Crime The town is home to the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organization based in Calabria. Several powerful criminal clans originate from the town, such as the Mammoliti-Rugolo.Woman of honour, The Independent, February 25, 1996 The town achieved a sad notoriety in July 2014 when, two weeks after Pope Francis, visiting Calabria, had publicly excommunicated the Mafia, a procession carrying a statue of the Madonna stopped to pay homage outside the house of a home confined local mafia leader.

Biography Rylov was born in the village of Istobensk, in the Vyatka Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Kirov Oblast, Russia). He was brought into the family of his stepfather, a notary (Rylov's father had a psychiatric illness). He moved to Saint Petersburg and studied at the Technical Design School of Baron Schtiglitz (1888‚Äì1891), then at the Imperial Academy of Arts under Arkhip Kuindzhi (1894‚Äì1897). In the Blue Expanse, 1918 Rylov was a member of the Mir iskusstva movement and its spin-off Union of Russian Artists, and also a member of the Association of Artists of the Revolutionary Russia. He was a chairman of the Kuindzhi Society. He started as a historical painter (his graduation work in the Imperial Academy of Arts was Assault of Pechenegs on a Slav village) but became a predominately landscape painter, though many of his paintings have some allusions with Russian history. Many of his landscapes painted after the October Revolution were seen as symbols of revolutionary freedom. At that time he also painted some typical Socialist Realism compositions like Lenin in Razliv. He taught in the Academy of Arts. In his studio he created what could almost be described as a small nature reserve, with squirrels, rabbits, a monkey named Manka, many wild birds (without cages) and two anthills. According to Mikhail Nesterov wild animals and birds loved Rylov and often came to his studio. Notable works Rylov's most renowned works are the Green Noise of 1904 showing a spring landscape with some early Slavic ships on the background and In the Blue Expanse of 1918 showing wild geese flying in the sky over a sea with some sailing ship in the bottom.

In the 1950s and 1960s he was an Australian dual-code rugby international representative and had previously been a Queensland amateur boxing champion in 1958 and 1959, who trialled for the 1960 Olympics. Background Raised in the Somerset Region in Linville, Queensland to May Helena Ryan and her husband Matthew a bushman and horseman, he learnt the rudiments of boxing as a young boy.Writer p405-409 He attended boarding-school for his high-school years at St Joseph's College, Nudgee from 1948 to 1952 where he started to play rugby union. Rugby union career After school Ryan played seven seasons with the Brisbane Brothers club from 1953 to 1959. In the Writer interview he refers to a senior player-coach role that he performed in his final two years at the club and he spoke of the loyalty he felt to the club in 1959 when having agreed terms with St George and having achieved his rugby union representative ambitions, he played out the 1959 season with Brothers and helped them win the 1959 Brisbane Club Premiership. He was selected in the squad for the 1957‚Äì58 Australia rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland and France. He made his international representative debut in the 3rd Test match of the tour, that against England national rugby union team at Twickenham on 1 February 1958. Australian were beaten 9‚Äì6. Following the tour's end he made four further appearances for the Wallabies in 1958, firstly against a visiting NZ Maori All Blacks side and then in all three Tests against the All Blacks on the Wallabies 1958 tour of New Zealand. Rugby league career St. George He was a front rower or second row forward with the St. George Dragons in the latter half of their 11-year consecutive premiership winning run from 1956 to 1966. He played 106 games for the club from 1960 to 1966, and played in seven winning grand finals. Ryan took over the 'Hard Man' mantle in the St George forward pack from Billy Wilson. From 1960 to 1962 when Ryan, Wilson and Norm Provan played together the St George forward pack was formidable. Ryan perfected a ball-and-all, one-on-one tackling style. He disdained gang tackling believing it was his individual responsibility to bring his man down hard without help. He would leave the ground each time he tackled, often winding his opponent with his shoulder, then bringing them to ground wrapped up, ball included. During his footballing career Ryan was nicknamed 'Kandos' after the New South Wales cement producing town due to his on-field toughness. He was selected in the squad for the 1963 Kangaroos tour of Great Britain and played in four tour matches on the tour. Along with Jim Lisle, Ryan made his international league debut in a tour match in England in 1963 but he did not play in any Tests on the tour. Collectively he and Lisle were Australia's 29th and 30th dual code rugby internationals. He later represented Australia in two domestic Tests against France, making his Test debut in 1964 in the 2nd Test in July 1964 at Lang Park, Brisbane. Ryan is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 386.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54 Canterbury- Bankstown Ryan left St George at the end of the 1966 season unable to come to terms in negotiations and wanting to coach. In 1967, as captain-coach, he led Canterbury in their 12‚Äì11 victory over St George in the preliminary final. He is therefore sometimes credited with bringing an end to the Dragons' premiership run. Certainly he was able to coach against and counter many of their tactics but the game had changed for all in 1967 with the introduction of the four tackle rule and the now maturing Dragons stars like all other teams in the competition, had to deal with a whole new style of game. He led Canterbury to the 1967 Grand Final against South Sydney and was captain-coach at the club through to the middle of the 1969 season when he retired due to injury. He continued on as coach that year and for the 1970 season. He played 52 games for Canterbury, scoring five tries. After football After retiring from football, Ryan became a barrister in 1970, and was an Alderman or Mayor of the City of Hurstville from 1974 to 1979. He was elected as the Labor Party member for Hurstville in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1976, defeating four-term Liberal MP Tom Mead, and serving until 1984. He had previously made an unsuccessful bid for the seat in 1973. Ryan was defeated by Liberal candidate Guy Yeomans at the 1984 election. The result was considered a minor upset as Labor comfortably won the election overall. Ryan's critics within the Labor Party suggested that he had failed to nurse the electorate sufficiently. Ryan contested the 1987 Bankstown by-election as an independent in opposition to the official Labor candidate. He polled 18.6% but was third behind the Labor candidate Doug Shedden. He contested the electorate again as an independent at the 1988 election but was again defeated with 18.7% of the vote. Ryan was President of the Rugby League Players Association for many years and a sports commentator with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1970 to 1973 where he usually worked alongside Alan Marks commentating on NSWRFL games. he still practises as a barrister at Selborne Chambers in Sydney. Accolades In 2000 Ryan was awarded the Australian Sports Medal. In 2004 he was named at prop-forward for the Berries to Bulldogs 70 Year Team of Champions On 1 April 2007 he was inducted into the Bulldogs Ring of Champions.

Life and career Roarke was born in Brooklyn, New York, where he was a street gang member during his youth.Adam Roarke Biography - Yahoo! Movies His father was a vaudeville comedian and his mother was a chorine, showgirl.Adam Roarke - Trailer - Showtimes - Cast - Movies - New York Times Roarke began his acting career under the name Jordan Gerler and then Jordan Grant; however, when he signed on with Universal Studios in 1957, he was told that he needed to change the name, because the studios already had one Mr. Grant (Cary Grant) under contract. Roarke appeared in a number of television series during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the role of Communications Officer Garrison in the original Star Trek pilot. He appeared in a string of AIP biker pictures along with Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Bruce Dern in the late 1960s, beginning with Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), and culminating with The Losers (subsequently retitled Nam's Angels) in 1970. In 1974, Roarke appeared in the financially successful car chase film Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with Fonda and Susan George, a role which showcased his range of acting skill. His breakout role came in 1980 when he portrayed Raymond Bailey, a self-important leading man whose stunt double was played by Steve Railsback in The Stunt Man. Peter O'Toole befriended Roarke during filming, and the two became drinking pals. Unfortunately, Roarke was unable to keep up with O‚ÄôToole, and was hospitalized with delirium tremens before shooting was concluded. Word spread around Hollywood quickly, and Roarke had difficulty finding work as a result. However, an offer to work on a low-budget independent film brought him to Austin, Texas, in 1982. At the time, Texas had a burgeoning movie industry‚Äîbilling itself as the \\"Third Coast\\"‚Äîbut lacked any real opportunities for aspiring film actors to learn their craft from industry veterans. Recognizing this need, Roarke opened the \\"Film Actors Lab\\" in the Dallas Communications Complex at the Studios in Las Colinas. \\"Graduates\\" of his program include Darryl Cox, Benton Jennings, Lar Park Lincoln and Lou Diamond Phillips. In 1989 Roarke married Carla DeLane and they had one child together. A child from Roarke‚Äôs previous marriage, Jordan Gerler, was also an actor, appearing in Rolling Thunder in 1977. Roarke died in Euless, Texas, of an apparent heart attack.

It lies at an elevation of 348 feet (106 m). It was once a rural community located on the Southern Pacific Railroad north-northwest of Clovis but has since become surrounded and annexed by the city of Fresno. Millerton Lake State Recreational Area is to its NE. The ZIP Code is 93650, and the community is inside area code 559. The first post office in Pinedale opened in 1923. Pinedale Assembly Center The community was the site of one of several temporary detention camps (also known as 'assembly centers') located throughout the West that represented the first phase of the mass incarceration of 97,785 Californians of Japanese ancestry during World War II. Pursuant to Executive Order 9066 signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, thirteen makeshift detention facilities were constructed at various California racetracks, fairgrounds, and labor camps. These facilities were intended to confine Japanese Americans until more permanent internment camps, such as those at Manzanar and Tule Lake in California, could be built in isolated areas of the country. Beginning on March 30, 1942, all native-born Americans and long-time legal residents of Japanese ancestry living in California were ordered to surrender themselves for detention. Known as \\"Camp Pinedale\\" the assembly center was located six miles (10 km) north of downtown Fresno on vacant land near an existing mill-workers housing area. The area is now within the Fresno city limits, north of Herndon Avenue and one mile (1.6 km) west of Blackstone Avenue. The Army officially acquired the site on 24 March 1942. At the time of acquisition there were 21 warehouses and 11 other buildings which had been used to store cotton, sugar, and machinery. From 7 May to 23 July 1942, the Pinedale Assembly Center housed a total of 4,823 evacuees, with a maximum of 4,792 at a time. The evacuees were from Sacramento and El Dorado counties, and Oregon and Washington. Ten barracks blocks, each with 26 buildings, were constructed for the evacuees, and a separate block was built for the military police and administration. There is an historical marker just east of Blackstone Avenue on the site of the railroad stop where the Japanese were brought to Fresno. The tracks have been removed, and there is now a bike trail in their place. The granite maker is on the side of the trail below the Freeway 41 overpass on Nees Avenue. At present, some of the original buildings from that era are still standing and a memorial is planned to be unveiled.

He played with his local club St.Josephs Doora-Barefield and with the Clare senior inter-county team from 1994 until 2006. He is the highest scoring back in All-Ireland Championship history with 0-97 from 51 games. In his book \\"Raising the Banner\\", Playing career Club McMahon retired from playing with his club Doora-Barefield in 2009. He has had some success at underage levels before finally winning a senior county championship title in 1998. This was later converted into a Munster club title and on St. Patrick's Day, 1999 McMahon claimed an All-Ireland club title following a huge win over Rathnure. Later that year he won a second county title as well as a second Munster club title. McMahon won a third Clare SHC medal in 2001. Inter-county McMahon is regarded by many as one of the finest hurlers to have ever played for Clare. He made his championship debut in 1994 against Tipperary and was a prominent member of the Clare side that won the Munster Championship and All- Ireland titles in 1995. Two years later in 1997 the team repeated the same feat, with McMahon claiming his second Munster and All-Ireland medals, this was followed by a third Munster medal in 1998. He played at centre half back, and along with Anthony Daly and Liam Doyle, formed one of the most formidable half backlines of the 1990s. McMahon was a stylish, skillful and powerful hurler but was also invaluable for his prowess with long distance frees, rarely finishing a game without his name on the scoresheet. He scored the first points for Clare in both the 1995 and 1997 All-Ireland finals. McMahon captained Clare to two successive All-Ireland semi finals in 2005 and 2006, losing to eventual winners Cork and Kilkenny respectively. On 6 October 2006, at 34 years of age, McMahon announced his retirement from inter-county hurling.

S. Cardone, directed by Renny Harlin and starring Steven Strait, Sebastian Stan, Laura Ramsey, Taylor Kitsch, Jessica Lucas, Toby Hemingway and Chace Crawford. The film, despite receiving very negative reviews, was a moderate box office success. Plot In the town of Ipswich, four high school boys ‚Äì Caleb Danvers, Pogue Parry, Reid Garwin and Tyler Simms, together known as the Sons of Ipswich ‚Äì are the descendants of colonial witch families and thus wield magical abilities which first manifest on their 13th birthday and grow stronger until they Ascend at 18. The Power is linked to their life force; the more they use, the faster they age. This becomes more dangerous as, upon Ascending, their powers reach their full strength and become so addictive, seductive as they say, that some cannot resist. Caleb ‚Äì who is closest to his 18th birthday ‚Äì exhibits restraint. While attending a bonfire, Caleb meets Sarah Wenham, a transfer student from a public high school in Boston. The Sons also meet Chase Collins, a new student at Spencer Academy. Their meeting is cut short when cops appear to break up the party. The boys escape by using their combined power. After a student is found mysteriously dead near their campus, various paranormal occurrences take place, with Sarah and her roommate Kate Tunney being the focus of it. Upset, Caleb suspects Reid ‚Äì the most reckless of the warlocks ‚Äì but he angrily denies any abusive usage of his powers. Caleb and later Pogue see a \\"darkling\\", a dead spirit and a malicious omen. Meanwhile, Caleb and Sarah quickly become romantically close. During a swim race, Caleb notices Chase, who had befriended the group, displaying magic usage. After researching, Caleb concludes that Chase descends from a fifth family, one believed long extinct, that he is the bastard son of Goodwin ‚ÄúGoody‚Äù Pope and that he is the true perpetrator. As the Sons discuss this revelation, Pogue learns that his girlfriend, Kate was rendered comatose by a spell. Enraged, he hastily challenges Chase, who swiftly hospitalizes him. Caleb visits Sarah, only to fall into Chase's trap. Chase reveals that he was unaware of his magic's origin, having been adopted. After locating his biological father, he learned of the price for Ascension; but it was too late and he has become too addicted to using magic. His biological father then transferred power to him. Chase wants to force other \\"Ascended\\" witches to transfer power to him as well, starting with Caleb. Despite Caleb's warning that having more power does not save him from aging to death, Chase ignores him. Before leaving, Chase threatens harm on Caleb's family and friends if he does not get what he wants. Caleb reveals the truth to Sarah and takes her to his father, a man of 44 years with a decrepit old body, exhausted from magic abuse. When Sarah suggests that one of the other three transfer their power to Caleb so he could evenly match Chase, Caleb immediately refuses, explaining that doing so will cost them all their lives. On the night of Caleb's 18th birthday, he leaves to face Chase alone and has Reid and Tyler safeguard Sarah in public. However, Chase easily kidnaps Sarah. At an old barn, the two confront each other. Chase reveals a spellbound Sarah and gives Caleb an ultimatum of his life for hers. Caleb declares he will not will his power away or let Sarah come to harm. They duel and Caleb is clearly outmatched. At the exact minute of his birth, he Ascends and his power fully matures, which allows him to mount an offensive. However, as Chase has more than one magical share, he still proves superior and the temporary turn of tide does not last long. Back at home, Evelyn, Caleb's mother, begs her husband to save Caleb. He sacrifices himself and transfers his power remotely to his son. Once his father's power is infused within him, Caleb hits Chase with a final blow that engulfs him in a ball of flame. Sarah, Kate and Pogue awaken, freed from their curses. Firefighters arrive on the scene. Caleb and Sarah wait until inspection of the barn's wreckage is complete; they are informed that a third person was not found, suggesting that Chase somehow survived and escaped. The pair get into Caleb's car and he casually uses magic to fix the busted windshield, which seems visibly unsettling to Sarah. He reassuringly holds her hand and they drive off.

Musical instruments In addition to voice, a range of instruments are used, including the Amadinda, the Akadinda xylophones, the Ennanga harp, the Etongoli lyre, drums, and the Kadongo (plural \\"budongo\\") lamellophone. Amadinda, akadinda, ennanga, and entongoli, as well as several types of drums, are used in the courtly music of the Kabaka, the king of Buganda. The kadongo, on the other hand, was more recently introduced to Baganda music, dating to the early 20th century. For this reason, budongo music is not part of the traditional court music.

Therefore, the octave (mw√†njo, plural myanjo) is divided into five intervals of approximately 240 cents (2.4 semitones). There is some variation in the interval length between instruments, and it even might vary in one (tunable) instrument during a performance. This means that in an emic description, the scale can be called an equipentatonic scale while on an etic level of description, there might be different variations of implementing that conceptual scale. Because this music is not harmony-based, chords are not used and only the octaves are consonant. In Baganda culture, like in many African cultures, the musical scale is not perceived as pointing from \\"low\\" to \\"high\\" tones but the other way around, from \\"small\\" to \\"large\\" or \\"big\\" tones. Despite this, the notation (created by European ethnomusicologists) used for the music denotes the deepest tone as \\"1\\" and the highest as \\"5\\". Timbre As in many African cultures, there is a preference in Baganda music for \\"noisy\\" timbres. In the Kadongo lamellophone, metal rings are put around the lamellas to create a buzzing sound. In the ennanga harp, scales of a kind of goana are fixed on the instrument in such a way that the vibrating strings will touch it. This gives a crackling timbre to the sound. In tuning the instruments (including the xylophones), the octave is often deliberately not tuned exactly, resulting in an intended acoustic beat effect. In singing, \\"coarse\\" timbres are often used. Form numbers The music is generally repetitive. The elementary pulses in the music are quite fast. There are different form numbers, i.e., number of elementary pulses in one cycle, in Baganda music. Besides the more usual 24, 36 and 48 (multiples of 12), which are widespread in African music, there are also instances of unusual form numbers: the amadinda piece \\"Bakebezi bali e Kitende\\" has 50, the pieces \\"Ab'e Bukerere balaagira emwanyi\\" and \\"Akawologoma\\" have 54 and the piece \\"Agenda n'omulungi azaawa\\" has a rare form number of 70. Inherent patterns Much of the music is based on playing parallel octaves. For example, on the amadinda, two musicians play parallel octaves in an interlocking fashion, i.e. the tones played by one musician fall exactly between those played by the other musicians. Both musicians play parallel octaves, moving their right hand and left hand in parallel within a distance of five xylophone bars. In perception, neither the pattern played by one nor the pattern played by the other musician is perceived, and although the parallel octaves can be heard, they are hardly noticeable. Instead, perceptually, the music seems to consist of two to three pitch levels in which irregular melodic/rhythmic inherent patterns can be heard. The inherent patterns in the middle pitch level combine out of low pitch notes of the higher octave and high pitch notes of the lower octave. Generally, the patterns that can be heard are not played by any of the musicians but result from the combination of the actions of both musicians. Sometimes several conflicting ways of hearing patterns are present, and perception might switch between them. The musicians can influence this by accentuating certain notes. Relationship between the instruments There are close relationships between music of both the ennanga and entongoli, and the amadinda. Pieces for the string instruments can be translated to the xylophone. The part for the right hand is assigned to one musician and the part for the left hand is assigned to another. The ennanga has only eight strings, so parallel octaves can only be played within a restricted interval, but the general compository principles applying to the xylophone music are the same in the chord instruments. Music and language Luganda is a tonal language. As with many other African musical cultures, the language significantly influences the music. The composer usually starts with the lyrics. The text's progression of tones partly determines the possible melodies of the song. He then composes a tune that fits the song's melodic pattern. When the music is played, inherent patterns may appear, which, to native speakers, may evoke new text associations. These might belong to totally different semantic areas, creating a strong poetic effect. Sometimes, such text associations \\"suggested\\" by the music are included in the sung text. However, they might be present for the Luganda speaker even if not made explicit in the text, adding an aesthetic level to the music that is only accessible to someone knowing conversant in the language. The names of musical compositions often refer to the text that can be associated with the music. Moreover, mnemonic phrases are often used to memorize the sometimes long and irregular sequences of notes in xylophone playing. Amadinda music Cultural and historical background The instrument The amadinda is a xylophone of the type called log xylophone. It consists of 12 wooden bars placed on two fresh banana stems. Sticks are inserted into the stems as separators between the bars. The bars are normally made from the wood of the Lusamba tree (Markhamia plarycalyx). Basics of Amadinda playing The amadinda (or madinda) is played by three musicians called omunazi, omwawuzi and omukoonezi, respectively. One of these sits on one side of the Xylophone, the other two on the other. Different seating arrangements are possible. The music is always started by the omunazi. The omwawuzi then comes in, putting his notes exactly between those of the omunazi. The part of the omunazi is called okunaga, the part of the omwawuzi is called okwawula. The following example shows the parts of the piece \\"Olutalo olw'e Nsinsi\\" (The battle of Nsinsi), a piece where the okwawula part is relatively simple. The form number of this piece is 24, i.e., one cycle has a total length of two times 12. Both musicians play parallel octaves on the first ten bars or the Amadinda, so in the following numerical notation, \\"1\\" means hitting the first (deepest) bar plus the sixth one together, and so on. :Okunaga 4.3.4.3.3.3.4.3.4.4.2^2. :Okwawula 5.2.1.5.2.1.5.2.1.5.2.1 The \\"^\\" denotes the place where the okwawula part starts‚Äîthis entry point may be elsewhere in other compositions. The resulting sequence is 413542313532413542412522. This sequence is repeated, possibly many times. The third musician, the omukoonezi, repeats the pattern occurring on the lowest two bars (the amatengezzi) two octaves higher on the highest two bars (the amakoonezi). The omukoonezi starts on the \\"2\\" of the okwawula. So, in this case, this pattern, called okukoonera is: :2.1...2.1...2.12.22..1... The okukoonera is what would be heard on these two plates if the amadinda was extended by additional octaves played by another pair of omunazi and omwawuzi. So, one could also think of the omukoonezi of \\"simulating\\" the actions of two additional musicians. When listening to the music, one can perceive the okukoonera as a separate pattern, but it might also combine with notes played on the adjacent bars to form other audible patterns. Adding drums Playing techniques and terminology The amadinda, like other types of south Ugandan Xylophones, is played by hitting the bars at the end with a stick. The tip of the bar is hit with the middle of the stick in an angle of about 45 degrees. The hands are moved in parallel. The movement should come from the wrist, and the arms should be moved as little as possible. The correct way of playing the amadinda is called Okusengejja, literally \\"to strain, to filter, to clarify, to sort things out\\". There are special techniques are used only by master players. * Okudaliza (literally \\"to stich a cloth together, to embroider\\") is a strongly accentuated way of playing. Certain tones are accentuated, bringing certain inherent patterns to the foreground. It is usually used to let the music culminate just before piece is finished. * The term okusita ebiyondo oba ebisenge (\\"to erect corners or walls\\"‚Äîokusita meaning \\"to plait, to interweave (reed, fence etc.)\\" is an advanced playing technique in which certain notes are dropped out, resulting in a sudden change of the patterns one can hear. There are several ways of playing Amadinda which are considered mistakes: * In Okubwatula, the plates are hit on the top with the tip of the sticks. This is a common beginner's mistake. Literally, the word means a strong pain, especially in the bones. * Okugugumula (literally \\"cause panic\\", \\"to rouse a flock of birds\\") is another beginner's mistake in which the hands are held stiffly and clumsily. * Okuyiwa (literally \\"to put down\\", \\"to let down\\", \\"to disappoint\\") is an irregular way of playing in which the bars are not hit at the right moment. * Okwokya (literally \\"to burn\\", \\"to roast\\") is a similar mistake in which the bars are hit too hastily. Miko transpositions Miko (singular Muko) are transpositions of a piece by one step of the scale (up or down). The whole melody is shifted up or down one xylophone bar: 1 is replaced by 2, 2 by 3, 3 by 4, 4 by 5 and 5 by 1. Although in the middle of the xylophone, the structure of the piece remains the same, the movement patterns of the musicians are changed, and the okukoonera part may become completely different. In fact, this way, from each piece of the total repertoire of 50 different compositions, 4 more pieces can be derived, giving a total of 250 pieces. Repertoire There are 50 different Amadinda pieces, not counting the miko transpositions. Their names are: Form number 24 (2 x 12): * Banno bakkola ng'osiga * Ndyegulira ekkadde * Ekyuma ekya Bora * Abana ba Kalemba besibye bulungi * Segomba ngoye Mwanga alimpa * Ennyana ekutudde * Olutalo olw'e Nsinsi * Wavvangaya * Omunyoro atunda nandere * Title unknown Form number 36 (2 x 18): * Ssematimba ne Kikwabanga * Naagenda kasana nga bulaba * Omusango gwa'abelere * Omuwabutwa wakyejo * Mawasansa * Alifuledi * Omutamanya n'gamba * Katulye ku bye pesa * Ganga alula * Balanga enkonge * Byasi byabuna olugudo * Ab'e Busoga gebbala ngabo * Nanjobe * Mugowa Iwatakise * Guelmye Mpangala * Mawanda segwanga * Ebigambo ebibulire bitta enyumba * Walugembe eyava e Khunywa * Omujooni: Balinserekerera balinsala ekyambe * Lutaaya yesse yekka * Kawumpuli * Abalung'ana be baleta engoye Form number 48 (2 x 24): * Atalabanga mudnu agende Buleega * Ezali embikke kasagazi kawunga * Kalagala e Bembe * Semakookiro ne Jjinju * Agawuluguma ennyanja * Akaalo kekamu * Afa talamusa * Okuzanyira ku nyanja kutunda mwoyo * Ngabo Maanya eziriwangula Mugerere * Ensiriba ya munange Katego * Atakulubere * Nkejje namuwanula * Kansimbe omuggo awali Kibuka * Omukazi omunafo agayigga na ngabo Other form numbers (these form numbers are very unusual in African music): * Bakebezi bali e Kitende form number 50 (2 x 25) * Ab'e Bukerere balaagira emwanyi form number 54 (2 x 27) * Akawologoma form number 54 (2 x 27) * Agenda n'omulungi azaawa form number 70 (2 x 35) Numerical scores of all of these compositions have been published by Gerhard Kubik (s. References). Well known Amadinda musicians Research on Amadinda music Amadinda music in East African and multi-cultural education Akadinda music Comparison with other music cultures Busoga (Embaire music) The Embaire is the Xylophone played in Busoga sub-region.Busoga sub-region The Embaire was described by Mark Stone, a lecturer at Oakland University and a former Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar at Makerere University during the 1996-1997 school year in these words: The Embaire is the most communal and most powerful xylophone tradition I know, a tradition that I am fortunate to teach regularly to my students at Oakland University in a number of classes Embaire keys are made from ensambiya wood (Bignoniaceae: Markhamia platycalyx), and played by beating the ends of the keys with sticks from a heavier wood called enzo (Rutaceae: Teclea nobilis). The keys are laid on felled banana stems, making an instrument which spans about 2.5m from end to end. The bass keys are large and broad but relatively thin. Wherever the instrument is played, a hole about 2 metres long and half a metre deep is first dug in the ground under the area where the bass keys will lie (the bottom ten keys of the Nakibembe instrument), to provide resonance: this chamber is sealed at the bottom end of the instrument with the base of a banana frond packed around with some of the excavated earth. In contrast to other parts of Uganda, Several impressive music groups with embaire xylophones are located relatively easily in Iganga district, Busoga. Parallels outside Uganda Like the Amadinda music, the Timbrh (timbili) lamellophone music of the Vute of central Cameroon is based on playing parallel Octaves, resulting in inherent patterns. This striking similarity provides some evidence that the principles underlying both forms of music might go back to ancient times.

An individual photon can be described as having right or left circular polarization, or a superposition of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical linear polarization, or a superposition of the two. The description of photon polarization contains many of the physical concepts and much of the mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well. Polarization is an example of a qubit degree of freedom, which forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as state vectors, probability amplitudes, unitary operators, and Hermitian operators, emerge naturally from the classical Maxwell's equations in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the Jones vector, usually used to describe the polarization of a classical wave. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the conservation of energy of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state. Many of the implications of the mathematical machinery are easily verified experimentally. In fact, many of the experiments can be performed with polaroid sunglass lenses. The connection with quantum mechanics is made through the identification of a minimum packet size, called a photon, for energy in the electromagnetic field. The identification is based on the theories of Planck and the interpretation of those theories by Einstein. The correspondence principle then allows the identification of momentum and angular momentum (called spin), as well as energy, with the photon. Polarization of classical electromagnetic waves Polarization states =Linear polarization= Effect of a polarizer on reflection from mud flats. In the first picture, the polarizer is rotated to minimize the effect; in the second it is rotated 90¬∞ to maximize it: almost all reflected sunlight is eliminated. The wave is linearly polarized (or plane polarized) when the phase angles \\\\alpha_x^, \\\\alpha_y are equal, : \\\\alpha_x = \\\\alpha_y \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\alpha. This represents a wave with phase \\\\alpha polarized at an angle \\\\theta with respect to the x axis. In this case the Jones vector : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} can be written with a single phase: : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) . The state vectors for linear polarization in x or y are special cases of this state vector. If unit vectors are defined such that : x\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} and : y\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} then the linearly polarized polarization state can be written in the \\"x-y basis\\" as : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) x\\\\rangle + \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha \\\\right ) y\\\\rangle = \\\\psi_x x\\\\rangle + \\\\psi_y y\\\\rangle. =Circular polarization= If the phase angles \\\\alpha_x and \\\\alpha_y differ by exactly \\\\pi / 2 and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude the wave is circularly polarized. The Jones vector then becomes : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pm i \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) where the plus sign indicates right circular polarization and the minus sign indicates left circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the x-y plane. If unit vectors are defined such that : R\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ i \\\\end{pmatrix} and : L\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ {1 \\\\over \\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -i \\\\end{pmatrix} then an arbitrary polarization state can be written in the \\"R-L basis\\" as : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\psi_R R\\\\rangle + \\\\psi_L L\\\\rangle where :\\\\psi_R = \\\\langle R\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\exp(i\\\\alpha_x) - i\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\exp(i\\\\alpha_y)) and :\\\\psi_L = \\\\langle L\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\exp(i\\\\alpha_x) + i\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\exp(i\\\\alpha_y)). We can see that : 1 = \\\\psi_R^2 + \\\\psi_L^2 . =Elliptical polarization= The general case in which the electric field rotates in the x-y plane and has variable magnitude is called elliptical polarization. The state vector is given by : \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix}. =Geometric visualization of an arbitrary polarization state= To get an understanding of what a polarization state looks like, one can observe the orbit that is made if the polarization state is multiplied by a phase factor of e^{i\\\\omega t} and then having the real parts of its components interpreted as x and y coordinates respectively. That is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\y(t)\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\Re(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\psi_x)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Re(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\psi_y)\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\Re\\\\left[e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\psi_x\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_y\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right] = \\\\Re\\\\left(e^{i\\\\omega t}\\\\psi\\\\rangle\\\\right). If only the traced out shape and the direction of the rotation of is considered when interpreting the polarization state, i.e. only :M(\\\\psi\\\\rangle) = \\\\left.\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\Big( x(t),\\\\,y(t) \\\\Big)\\\\,\\\\right\\\\,\\\\forall\\\\,t \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (where and are defined as above) and whether it is overall more right circularly or left circularly polarized (i.e. whether or vice versa), it can be seen that the physical interpretation will be the same even if the state is multiplied by an arbitrary phase factor, since :M(e^{i\\\\alpha}\\\\psi\\\\rangle) = M(\\\\psi\\\\rangle),\\\\ \\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} and the direction of rotation will remain the same. In other words, there is no physical difference between two polarization states \\\\psi\\\\rangle and e^{i\\\\alpha}\\\\psi\\\\rangle, between which only a phase factor differs. It can be seen that for a linearly polarized state, M will be a line in the xy plane, with length 2 and its middle in the origin, and whose slope equals to . For a circularly polarized state, M will be a circle with radius and with the middle in the origin. Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of a classical electromagnetic wave Energy density of classical electromagnetic waves =Energy in a plane wave= The energy per unit volume in classical electromagnetic fields is (cgs units) and also Planck unit : \\\\mathcal{E}_c = \\\\frac{1}{8\\\\pi} \\\\left [ \\\\mathbf{E}^2( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) + \\\\mathbf{B}^2( \\\\mathbf{r} , t ) \\\\right ] . For a plane wave, this becomes : \\\\mathcal{E}_c = \\\\frac{\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2}{8\\\\pi} where the energy has been averaged over a wavelength of the wave. =Fraction of energy in each component= The fraction of energy in the x component of the plane wave is : f_x = \\\\frac{ \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\theta }{ \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2 } = \\\\psi_x^*\\\\psi_x = \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta with a similar expression for the y component resulting in f_y=\\\\sin^2\\\\theta. The fraction in both components is : \\\\psi_x^*\\\\psi_x + \\\\psi_y^*\\\\psi_y = \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\psi\\\\rangle = 1. Momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves The momentum density is given by the Poynting vector : \\\\boldsymbol { \\\\mathcal{P}} = {1 \\\\over 4\\\\pi c } \\\\mathbf{E}( \\\\mathbf{r}, t ) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}( \\\\mathbf{r}, t ). For a sinusoidal plane wave traveling in the z direction, the momentum is in the z direction and is related to the energy density: : \\\\mathcal{P}_z c = \\\\mathcal{E}_c. The momentum density has been averaged over a wavelength. Angular momentum density of classical electromagnetic waves Electromagnetic waves can have both orbital and spin angular momentum. The total angular momentum density is : \\\\boldsymbol { \\\\mathcal{L} } = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\boldsymbol { \\\\mathcal{P} } = {1 \\\\over 4\\\\pi c } \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\left [ \\\\mathbf{E}( \\\\mathbf{r}, t ) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}( \\\\mathbf{r}, t ) \\\\right ]. For a sinusoidal plane wave propagating along z axis the orbital angular momentum density vanishes. The spin angular momentum density is in the z direction and is given by : \\\\mathcal{L} = { {\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2} \\\\over {8\\\\pi\\\\omega} } \\\\left ( \\\\mid \\\\langle R  \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\langle L  \\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\mid^2 \\\\right ) = { 1 \\\\over \\\\omega } \\\\mathcal{E}_c \\\\left ( \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2 \\\\right ) where again the density is averaged over a wavelength. Optical filters and crystals Passage of a classical wave through a polaroid filter Linear polarization A linear filter transmits one component of a plane wave and absorbs the perpendicular component. In that case, if the filter is polarized in the x direction, the fraction of energy passing through the filter is : f_x = \\\\psi_x^*\\\\psi_x = \\\\cos^2\\\\theta.\\\\, Example of energy conservation: Passage of a classical wave through a birefringent crystal An ideal birefringent crystal transforms the polarization state of an electromagnetic wave without loss of wave energy. Birefringent crystals therefore provide an ideal test bed for examining the conservative transformation of polarization states. Even though this treatment is still purely classical, standard quantum tools such as unitary and Hermitian operators that evolve the state in time naturally emerge. =Initial and final states= A birefringent crystal is a material that has an optic axis with the property that the light has a different index of refraction for light polarized parallel to the axis than it has for light polarized perpendicular to the axis. Light polarized parallel to the axis are called \\"extraordinary rays\\" or \\"extraordinary photons\\", while light polarized perpendicular to the axis are called \\"ordinary rays\\" or \\"ordinary photons\\". If a linearly polarized wave impinges on the crystal, the extraordinary component of the wave will emerge from the crystal with a different phase than the ordinary component. In mathematical language, if the incident wave is linearly polarized at an angle \\\\theta with respect to the optic axis, the incident state vector can be written : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} and the state vector for the emerging wave can be written : \\\\psi '\\\\rangle = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x \\\\right ) & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_y \\\\right ) \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\hat{U} \\\\psi\\\\rangle. While the initial state was linearly polarized, the final state is elliptically polarized. The birefringent crystal alters the character of the polarization. =Dual of the final state= A calcite crystal laid upon a paper with some letters showing the double refraction The initial polarization state is transformed into the final state with the operator U. The dual of the final state is given by : \\\\langle \\\\psi ' = \\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\hat{U}^{\\\\dagger} where U^{\\\\dagger} is the adjoint of U, the complex conjugate transpose of the matrix. =Unitary operators and energy conservation= The fraction of energy that emerges from the crystal is :\\\\langle\\\\psi ' \\\\psi '\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\psi \\\\hat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{U}\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\psi\\\\psi\\\\rangle = 1. In this ideal case, all the energy impinging on the crystal emerges from the crystal. An operator U with the property that :\\\\hat{U}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\hat{U} = I, where I is the identity operator and U is called a unitary operator. The unitary property is necessary to ensure energy conservation in state transformations. =Hermitian operators and energy conservation= Doubly refracting Calcite from Iceberg claim, Dixon, New Mexico. This 35 pound (16 kg) crystal, on display at the National Museum of Natural History, is one of the largest single crystals in the United States. If the crystal is very thin, the final state will be only slightly different from the initial state. The unitary operator will be close to the identity operator. We can define the operator H by : \\\\hat{U} \\\\approx I + i\\\\hat{H} and the adjoint by : \\\\hat{U}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\approx I - i\\\\hat{H}^{\\\\dagger}. Energy conservation then requires : I = \\\\hat{U}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\hat{U} \\\\approx \\\\left ( I - i\\\\hat{H}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\right ) \\\\left ( I + i\\\\hat{H} \\\\right ) \\\\approx I - i\\\\hat{H}^{\\\\dagger} + i\\\\hat{H}. This requires that : \\\\hat{H} = \\\\hat{H}^{\\\\dagger}. Operators like this that are equal to their adjoints are called Hermitian or self-adjoint. The infinitesimal transition of the polarization state is : \\\\psi ' \\\\rangle - \\\\psi\\\\rangle = i\\\\hat{H} \\\\psi\\\\rangle. Thus, energy conservation requires that infinitesimal transformations of a polarization state occur through the action of a Hermitian operator. Photons: The connection to quantum mechanics Energy, momentum, and angular momentum of photons =Energy= The treatment to this point has been classical. It is a testament, however, to the generality of Maxwell's equations for electrodynamics that the treatment can be made quantum mechanical with only a reinterpretation of classical quantities. The reinterpretation is based on the theories of Max Planck and the interpretation by Albert Einstein of those theories and of other experiments. Einstein's conclusion from early experiments on the photoelectric effect is that electromagnetic radiation is composed of irreducible packets of energy, known as photons. The energy of each packet is related to the angular frequency of the wave by the relation : \\\\epsilon = \\\\hbar \\\\omega where \\\\hbar is an experimentally determined quantity known as Planck's constant. If there are N photons in a box of volume V , the energy in the electromagnetic field is : N \\\\hbar \\\\omega and the energy density is : {N \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\over V} The photon energy can be related to classical fields through the correspondence principle which states that for a large number of photons, the quantum and classical treatments must agree. Thus, for very large N , the quantum energy density must be the same as the classical energy density : {N \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\over V} = \\\\mathcal{E}_c = \\\\frac{\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2}{8\\\\pi}. The number of photons in the box is then : N = \\\\frac{V }{8\\\\pi \\\\hbar \\\\omega}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\mid^2 . =Momentum= The correspondence principle also determines the momentum and angular momentum of the photon. For momentum : \\\\mathcal{P}_z = {N \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\over cV} = {N \\\\hbar k_z \\\\over V} where k_z is the wave number. This implies that the momentum of a photon is : p_z=\\\\hbar k_z .\\\\, =Angular momentum and spin= Similarly for the spin angular momentum : \\\\mathcal{L} = { 1 \\\\over \\\\omega } \\\\mathcal{E}_c \\\\left ( \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2 \\\\right ) = { N\\\\hbar \\\\over V } \\\\left ( \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2 \\\\right ) where Ec is field strength. This implies that the spin angular momentum of the photon is : l_z = \\\\hbar \\\\left ( \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2 \\\\right ). the quantum interpretation of this expression is that the photon has a probability of \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 of having a spin angular momentum of \\\\hbar and a probability of \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2 of having a spin angular momentum of -\\\\hbar . We can therefore think of the spin angular momentum of the photon being quantized as well as the energy. The angular momentum of classical light has been verified. A photon that is linearly polarized (plane polarized) is in a superposition of equal amounts of the left-handed and right-handed states. Spin operator The spin of the photon is defined as the coefficient of \\\\hbar in the spin angular momentum calculation. A photon has spin 1 if it is in the  R \\\\rangle state and -1 if it is in the  L \\\\rangle state. The spin operator is defined as the outer product : \\\\hat{S} \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ R\\\\rangle \\\\langle R  - L\\\\rangle \\\\langle L  = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The eigenvectors of the spin operator are R\\\\rangle and L\\\\rangle with eigenvalues 1 and -1, respectively. The expected value of a spin measurement on a photon is then : \\\\langle \\\\psi \\\\hat{S} \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\mid \\\\psi_R \\\\mid^2 - \\\\mid \\\\psi_L \\\\mid^2. An operator S has been associated with an observable quantity, the spin angular momentum. The eigenvalues of the operator are the allowed observable values. This has been demonstrated for spin angular momentum, but it is in general true for any observable quantity. Spin states We can write the circularly polarized states as : s\\\\rangle where s=1 for R\\\\rangle and s= -1 for L\\\\rangle. An arbitrary state can be written : \\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_{s=-1,1} a_s \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x -i s \\\\theta \\\\right ) s\\\\rangle where \\\\alpha_1 and \\\\alpha_{-1} are phase angles, Œ∏ is the angle by which the frame of reference is rotated, and : \\\\sum_{s=-1,1} \\\\mid a_s \\\\mid^2=1. Spin and angular momentum operators in differential form When the state is written in spin notation, the spin operator can be written : \\\\hat{S}_d \\\\rightarrow i { \\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} : \\\\hat{S}_d^{\\\\dagger} \\\\rightarrow -i { \\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta}. The eigenvectors of the differential spin operator are : \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x -i s \\\\theta \\\\right ) s\\\\rangle. To see this note : \\\\hat{S}_d \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x -i s \\\\theta \\\\right ) s\\\\rangle \\\\rightarrow i { \\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x -i s \\\\theta \\\\right ) s\\\\rangle = s \\\\left [ \\\\exp \\\\left ( i \\\\alpha_x -i s \\\\theta \\\\right ) s\\\\rangle \\\\right ]. The spin angular momentum operator is : \\\\hat{l}_z = \\\\hbar \\\\hat{S}_d. The nature of probability in quantum mechanics =Probability for a single photon= There are two ways in which probability can be applied to the behavior of photons; probability can be used to calculate the probable number of photons in a particular state, or probability can be used to calculate the likelihood of a single photon to be in a particular state. The former interpretation violates energy conservation. The latter interpretation is the viable, if nonintuitive, option. Dirac explains this in the context of the double-slit experiment: > Some time before the discovery of quantum mechanics people realized that the > connection between light waves and photons must be of a statistical > character. What they did not clearly realize, however, was that the wave > function gives information about the probability of one photon being in a > particular place and not the probable number of photons in that place. The > importance of the distinction can be made clear in the following way. > Suppose we have a beam of light consisting of a large number of photons > split up into two components of equal intensity. On the assumption that the > beam is connected with the probable number of photons in it, we should have > half the total number going into each component. If the two components are > now made to interfere, we should require a photon in one component to be > able to interfere with one in the other. Sometimes these two photons would > have to annihilate one another and other times they would have to produce > four photons. This would contradict the conservation of energy. The new > theory, which connects the wave function with probabilities for one photon > gets over the difficulty by making each photon go partly into each of the > two components. Each photon then interferes only with itself. Interference > between two different photons never occurs. > --Paul Dirac, The Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1 =Probability amplitudes= The probability for a photon to be in a particular polarization state depends on the fields as calculated by the classical Maxwell's equations. The polarization state of the photon is proportional to the field. The probability itself is quadratic in the fields and consequently is also quadratic in the quantum state of polarization. In quantum mechanics, therefore, the state or probability amplitude contains the basic probability information. In general, the rules for combining probability amplitudes look very much like the classical rules for composition of probabilities: [The following quote is from Baym, Chapter 1] : > # The probability amplitude for two successive probabilities is the product > of amplitudes for the individual possibilities. For example, the amplitude > for the x polarized photon to be right circularly polarized and for the > right circularly polarized photon to pass through the y-polaroid is \\\\langle > Rx\\\\rangle\\\\langle yR\\\\rangle, the product of the individual amplitudes. # > The amplitude for a process that can take place in one of several > indistinguishable ways is the sum of amplitudes for each of the individual > ways. For example, the total amplitude for the x polarized photon to pass > through the y-polaroid is the sum of the amplitudes for it to pass as a > right circularly polarized photon, \\\\langle yR\\\\rangle\\\\langle Rx\\\\rangle, > plus the amplitude for it to pass as a left circularly polarized photon, > \\\\langle yL\\\\rangle\\\\langle Lx\\\\rangle\\\\dots # The total probability for the > process to occur is the absolute value squared of the total amplitude > calculated by 1 and 2. Uncertainty principle rightthumb400pxCauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality in Euclidean space. \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{W} = \\\\ \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\ \\\\cos a . This implies \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\le \\\\ \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{W} \\\\ . =Mathematical preparation= For any legal operators the following inequality, a consequence of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality, is true. : \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\langle (\\\\hat{A} \\\\hat{B} - \\\\hat{B} \\\\hat{A} )x  x \\\\rangle^2\\\\leq \\\\ \\\\hat{A} x \\\\^2 \\\\ \\\\hat{B} x \\\\^2. If B A œà and A B œà are defined, then by subtracting the means and re-inserting in the above formula, we deduce : \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} \\\\hat{A} \\\\, \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} \\\\hat{B} \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\left[{\\\\hat{A}},{\\\\hat{B}}\\\\right]\\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\psi\\\\right where :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\hat{X} \\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\psi = \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\psi  \\\\hat{X}  \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle is the operator mean of observable X in the system state œà and :\\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} \\\\hat{X} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\langle {\\\\hat{X}}^2\\\\rangle_\\\\psi - \\\\langle {\\\\hat{X}}\\\\rangle_\\\\psi ^2}. Here : \\\\left[{\\\\hat{A}},{\\\\hat{B}}\\\\right] \\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ \\\\hat{A} \\\\hat{B} - \\\\hat{B} \\\\hat{A} is called the commutator of A and B. This is a purely mathematical result. No reference has been made to any physical quantity or principle. It simply states that the uncertainty of one operator times the uncertainty of another operator has a lower bound. =Application to angular momentum= The connection to physics can be made if we identify the operators with physical operators such as the angular momentum and the polarization angle. We have then : \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} \\\\hat{l}_z \\\\, \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} {\\\\theta} \\\\ge \\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2}, which means that angular momentum and the polarization angle cannot be measured simultaneously with infinite accuracy. (The polarization angle can be measured by checking whether the photon can pass through a polarizing filter oriented at a particular angle, or a polarizing beam splitter. This results in a yes/no answer which, if the photon was plane-polarized at some other angle, depends on the difference between the two angles.) States, probability amplitudes, unitary and Hermitian operators, and eigenvectors Much of the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics appears in the classical description of a polarized sinusoidal electromagnetic wave. The Jones vector for a classical wave, for instance, is identical with the quantum polarization state vector for a photon. The right and left circular components of the Jones vector can be interpreted as probability amplitudes of spin states of the photon. Energy conservation requires that the states be transformed with a unitary operation. This implies that infinitesimal transformations are transformed with a Hermitian operator. These conclusions are a natural consequence of the structure of Maxwell's equations for classical waves. Quantum mechanics enters the picture when observed quantities are measured and found to be discrete rather than continuous. The allowed observable values are determined by the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the observable. In the case angular momentum, for instance, the allowed observable values are the eigenvalues of the spin operator. These concepts have emerged naturally from Maxwell's equations and Planck's and Einstein's theories. They have been found to be true for many other physical systems. In fact, the typical program is to assume the concepts of this section and then to infer the unknown dynamics of a physical system. This was done, for instance, with the dynamics of electrons. In that case, working back from the principles in this section, the quantum dynamics of particles were inferred, leading to Schr√∂dinger's equation, a departure from Newtonian mechanics. The solution of this equation for atoms led to the explanation of the Balmer series for atomic spectra and consequently formed a basis for all of atomic physics and chemistry. This is not the only occasion in which Maxwell's equations have forced a restructuring of Newtonian mechanics. Maxwell's equations are relativistically consistent. Special relativity resulted from attempts to make classical mechanics consistent with Maxwell's equations (see, for example, Moving magnet and conductor problem).

Spiral staircase Utility Furniture dressing table made by Heal's, 1947. Oak. The sign of the four poster on the fa√ßade of the Tottenham Court Road store. Heal's (\\"Heal and Son Ltd\\") is a British furniture and furniture retail company comprising seven stores, selling a range of furniture, lighting and home accessories. For over two centuries, it has been known for promoting modern design and employing talented young designers. History The original Heal's firm was established in 1810 as a feather-dressing business by John Harris Heal and his son.Alan Crawford, \\"Heal, Sir Ambrose (1872‚Äì1959)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 12 Aug 2007 In 1818, the business moved to Tottenham Court Road, London and expanded into bedding, bedstead and furniture manufacture and into retailing. By the end of the nineteenth century it was one of the best-known furniture suppliers in London. In the early 20th century Heal's was one of the first retailers to bring electric lighting to the British market. During the second world war the factory at Tottenham Court Road was converted to produce parachutes. Heal's featured at the Festival of Britain in 1951 and in 1977 restored the banqueting table at Buckingham Palace for the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Ambrose Heal The notability of Heal's rests upon the achievements of Sir Ambrose Heal, who worked in the company as craftsman, designer and finally Chairman, for 60 years from 1893 to 1953. Ambrose Heal's contribution to the business, and to British furniture-making and applied design, was his marriage of the ethos of the Arts and Crafts Movement as to beauty and utility with the techniques and economics of commerce. The combination of 'Good Design' with industrial production was contrary to the moral, hand crafted principles of the Arts and Crafts Movement but was in line with the certain European approaches to bringing high calibre product design to a middle class market. Following the precedent of the Deutscher Werkbund, which had been established in Germany in 1907, Ambrose Heal was one of the group of designers, industrialists and business people who founded the Design and Industries Association in 1915, slogan \\"Nothing Need Be Ugly\\". Heal developed his business as a design, manufacturing and retail concern in accord with the philosophy of which he was a key proponent. Heal's at Tottenham Court Road Heal's has operated since 1818 in Tottenham Court Road, and from the present site since 1840.London's Old Latin Quarter: Being an Account of Tottenham Court Road and Its ... By Edwin Beresford Chancellor - Page 153 Its first purpose-built store, completed in 1854, was then one of the largest in London: the architect was James Morant Lockyer who presented the RIBA with a photographic elevation in May 1855. This is one of the earliest known professional applications of architectural photography in Britain. The central part of the present building was commissioned by Ambrose Heal and designed by his cousin, and best friend, Cecil Brewer of the architectural practice Smith and Brewer. It was completed in 1917 and is a distinctive modern building, immediately hailed as a landmark in shop architecture, subsequently extended in a number of phases. The Brewer improvements included a spiral staircase that is still part of the store to this day, providing access across all three retail floors. A bronze cat presides over the staircase that is considered to be the store mascot. It was once sold to a customer by Dodie Smith (author of 101 Dalmatians) who was then a Heal's sales assistant, but Heal wrote to the customer retracting the sale with a card saying \\"Heal's mascot. Not for sale\\". An extension on the southern side of the building was added in 1938, designed by Sir Edward Maufe.Comprehensive List of buildings designed by Maufe, accessed September 2011 Mansard Gallery The new Tottenham Court Road store included an art gallery, the Mansard Gallery, which held several influential exhibitions. It was a significant venue in the artistic life of London between the wars; it was where Aldous Huxley first met Virginia Woolf, and where sets of furniture were presented to Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer and Maxwell Fry. =Exhibition of French Art 1914-1919= The most influential exhibition held at the Mansard Gallery was the Exhibition of French Art 1914-1919, held in 1919. This was organised by the art critic Sacheverell Sitwell, included works by several now-famous artists and was the first British exhibition of Picasso, Matisse and Modigliani. The exhibition was well received by modernist critics and received generally positive reviews in The Times and The Manchester Guardian. The Mansard Gallery closed in the 1980s. In 2010 an online version of the Mansard Gallery opened on Heal's website. Guildford store A second store was opened in Guildford in 1972 and the company remained highly profitable until the mid-1970s, when it began to suffer losses, principally in the non-retail businesses. In May 2015, Heal's announced the Guildford store would close prior to the redevelopment of the Tunsgate shopping centre. Corporate history Heal's was run as a family business designing, manufacturing and selling furniture, applied arts, interior decorating and household goods until 1983. The business has subsequently been in a number of ownerships trading as a retailer. =Acquisition by Storehouse= Until its acquisition by Storehouse plc in 1983, the business operated as a number of separate companies carrying out particular trading activities. These included retailing, contracting, fabric conversion and wholesaling, cabinet furniture manufacture and bed and bedding manufacture. The various operating companies were owned by an investment company, Heal & Son (Holdings) Ltd. After the acquisition, a number of trading activities were reduced and the Company operated only as a retailer. =Management buyout= In 1984 Heal's was expanded to five stores from the original two. In the recession of the late 1980s the business again incurred losses and after shrinking back to the two original stores the company was the subject of a management buyout. The buyout became effective in September 1990 ending a seven-year period in the Storehouse group of companies. Whilst part of Storehouse, Heal's had been one of a national portfolio of retailers. Following the management buyout the business merchandise range was expanded with most of the product lines changed to ranges designed especially for Heal's. In the second half of the nineties Heal's started to expand and develop, opening a new store on King's Road Chelsea in 1995 and floating the company on the London Stock Exchange in 1997. In 1998 a new store was opened in Kingston, London and then in November 2000 Heal's launched an ecommerce website. The company has stated its intention to become an ‚Äòecommerce business with showrooms'. =Acquisition by Wittington Investments= On 16 August 2001, Wittington Investments Limited acquired Heal's plc, reverting it to a private company. The new owner has stated that it supports Heal's \\"unique character\\", intending it to continue as a contemporary home furnishing retailer. Recent history Since the Wittington acquisition, Heal's has expanded nationally and developed online retailing. New outlets outside the South East of England included stores in the centre of Manchester opened in 2003, although this store closed in 2010, at Redbrick Mill in Batley, near Leeds in 2005 and Brighton in 2007. In 2015 the Kings Road store in London was replaced by a smaller store in Notting Hill, which in 2018 re-opened in the Westfield London shopping centre. In 2017 a store was opened in the Mailbox Birmingham shopping centre. In 2019 an outlet store was opened in Chiswick, London. The flagship Tottenham Court Road store celebrated its 200th year in 2018, marking the anniversary by re-erecting the iconic 'Sign of the Four Poster'. Reinterpreted by sign-writer Hannah Sunny Whaler, the sign and hanging arm were recreated using images from the company's archive.

Origins During the medieval period, scholasticism became the standard accepted method of philosophy and theology. The Scholastic method declined with the advent of humanism in the 15th and 16th centuries, after which time it came to be viewed by some as rigid and formalistic. \\"Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear. An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during the 16th century and enriched Scholastic literature with many eminent contributions. Thomas de Vio Cajetan (1469‚Äì1534), Gabriel V√°squez (1551‚Äì1604), Toletus (1532‚Äì1596), Fonseca (1528‚Äì1599), and especially Francisco Su√°rez (1548‚Äì1617) were profound thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles they had adopted.\\"Joseph Louis Perrier, The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century, \\"Chapter VIII: \\"Chapter VIII: Forerunners of the Neo-Scholastic Revival,\\" Accessed 1 August 2013 Moreover, as J. A. Weisheipl O.P. emphasizes, within the Dominican Order Thomistic scholasticism has been continuous since the time of Aquinas: \\"Thomism was always alive in the Dominican Order, small as it was after the ravages of the Reformation, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic occupation. Repeated legislation of the General Chapters, beginning after the death of St. Thomas, as well as the Constitutions of the Order, required all Dominicans to teach the doctrine of St. Thomas both in philosophy and in theology.\\" ‚ÄúThe Revival of Thomism: An Historical Survey, ‚Äù James Weisheipl, 1962. A further idea of the longstanding historic continuity of Dominican scholasticism and neo- scholasticism may be derived from the list of people associated with the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas. In the mid‚Äì19th century, interest in Roman Catholic circles in scholastic methodology and thought began once again to flourish, in large part in reaction against the \\"Modernism\\" inspired by thinkers such as Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, the use of which was perceived as inimical to Christian doctrine.Fergus Kerr, Twentieth-century Catholic theologians, (Blackwell, 2007), p1. The meaning and core beliefs of theological Modernism were never tightly defined; in large part, Modernism simply represented that which was attacked by Rome in 1907 as ‚Äòthe sum of all heresies‚Äô. Moreover, given that Modernism remained the perceived enemy of neo- Scholasticism throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there were certainly changes over the decades in what was attacked. Certainly, however, common threads of thought can be detected. These include (1) the belief that revelation continued up to and including the present day and, therefore, did not stop with the death of the last apostle; (2) the belief that dogmas were not immutable and that ecclesial dogmatic formulas could change both in interpretation and in content; (3) the use of the historical-critical method in biblical exegesis.See J√ºrgen Mettepenningen, Nouvelle Th√©ologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II, (London: T&T; Clark, 2010), p20. For many thinkers, the dangers of Modernism could only be overcome by a complete return to scholastic theology. In particular, Catholic interest came to focus on the 13th-century theologian Thomas Aquinas, whose writings were increasingly viewed as the ultimate expression of philosophy and theology, to which all Catholic thought must remain faithful.This way of approaching Thomas was itself scholastic in inspiration. The scholastics used a book by a renowned scholar, called auctor, as basic course literature. By reading this book thoroughly and critically, the disciples learned to appreciate the theories of the auctor and, thus, of the problems studied in the whole discipline, in a critical and self-confident way. Scholastic works therefore have a tendency to take the form of a long list of \\"footnotes\\" to the works studied, not being able to take a stand as theories on their own. This was particularly vigorous at first in Italy. \\"The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy was Gaetano Sanseverino, (1811‚Äì1865), a canon at Naples.\\"Joseph Louis Perrier, The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century, \\"Chapter IX: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Italy\\", Accessed 1 August 2013 The German Jesuit Joseph Kleutgen (1811‚Äì83), who taught at Rome, was a particularly influential figure in his defences of pre-modern theology and philosophy, his argument that a theology based upon a post- Cartesian philosophy undermined Catholic doctrine, and his recommendation that the Aristotelian scientific method of Aquinas was the theology the Church now needed.Fergus Kerr, ‚ÄòThomism‚Äô, in The Cambridge Dictionary of Christian Theology, (Cambridge, 2011), p507. The Accademia di San Tommaso, founded in 1874, published until 1891 a review entitled La Scienza Italiana. Numerous works were produced by Giovanni Maria Cornoldi (1822‚Äì92), Giuseppe Pecci, Tommaso Maria Zigliara (1833‚Äì93), Satolli (1839‚Äì1909), Liberatore (1810‚Äì92), Barberis (1847‚Äì96), Schiffini (1841‚Äì1906), de Maria, Talamo, Lorenzelli, Ballerini, Matussi and others. The Italian writers at first laid special emphasis on the metaphysical features of Scholasticism, and less to the empirical sciences or to the history of philosophy. Papal support for such trends had begun under Pope Pius IX, who had recognized the importance of the movement in various letters. The dogma of the Immaculate Conception (1854), the Syllabus errorum (1864) and the proclamation of papal infallibility (1870) all heralded a move away from Modernist forms of theological thought.J√ºrgen Mettepenningen, Nouvelle Th√©ologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II, (London: T&T; Clark, 2010), p. 19. The most important moment for the spread of the movement occurred with Pope Leo XIII‚Äôs encyclical \\"Aeterni Patris\\", issued on 4 August 1879. Aeterni Patris set out what would come to be seen as the principles of neo-scholasticism, and provided the stimulus for the donation of increased support to neo-scholastic thought. It called for ‚ÄòChristian philosophy to be restored according to the spirit of St Thomas‚Äô. Key principles \\"Neo-Scholasticism is characterized by systematic investigation, analytical rigor, clear terminology, and argumentation that proceeds from first principles, chief among them that objective truth is both real and knowable.\\"Iovino, James. \\"Can Neo-Scholasticism Make a Comeback?\\", New Oxford Review, January-February 2018 Neo-scholasticism sought to restore the fundamental doctrines embodied in the scholasticism of the 13th century. The essential conceptions may be summarized as follows: 1\\\\. God, pure actuality and absolute perfection, is substantially distinct from every finite thing: He alone can create and preserve all beings other than Himself. His infinite knowledge includes all that has been, is, or shall be, and likewise all that is possible. 2\\\\. As to our knowledge of the material world: whatever exists is itself, an incommunicable, individual substance. To the core of self-sustaining reality, in the oak-tree for instance, other realities (accidents) are added‚Äîsize, form, roughness, and so on. All oak-trees are alike, indeed are identical in respect of certain constituent elements. Considering this likeness and even identity, our human intelligence groups them into one species and again, in view of their common characteristics, it ranges various species under one genus. Such is the Aristotelean solution of the problem of universals. Each substance is in its nature fixed and determined; and nothing is farther from the spirit of Scholasticism than a theory of evolution which would regard even the essences of things as products of change. But this statism requires as its complement a moderate dynamism, and this is supplied by the central concepts of act and potency. Whatsoever changes is, just for that reason, limited. The oak-tree passes through a process of growth, of becoming: whatever is actually in it now was potentially in it from the beginning. Its vital functions go on unceasingly (accidental change); but the tree itself will die, and out of its decayed trunk other substances will come forth (substantial change). The theory of matter and form is simply an interpretation of the substantial changes which bodies undergo. The union of matter and form constitutes the essence of concrete being, and this essence is endowed with existence. Throughout all change and becoming there runs a rhythm of finality; the activities of the countless substances of the universe converge towards an end which is known to God; finality involves optimism. 3\\\\. Man, a compound of body (matter) and of soul (form), puts forth activities of a higher order‚Äîknowledge and volition. Through his senses he perceives concrete objects, e.g. this oak; through his intellect he knows the abstract and universal (the oak). All our intellectual activity rests on sensory function; but through the active intellect (intellectus agens) an abstract representation of the sensible object is provided for the intellectual possibility. Hence the characteristic of the idea, its non- materiality, and on this is based the principal argument for the spirituality and immortality of the soul. Here, too, is the foundation of logic and of the theory of knowledge, the justification of our judgments and syllogisms. Upon knowledge follows the appetitive process, sensory or intellectual according to the sort of knowledge. The will (appetitus intellectualis) in certain conditions is free, and thanks to this liberty man is the master of his destiny. Like all other beings, we have an end to attain and we are morally obliged, though not compelled, to attain it. Natural happiness would result from the full development of our powers of knowing and loving. We should find and possess God in this world since the corporeal world is the proper object of our intelligence. But above nature is the order of grace and our supernatural happiness will consist in the direct intuition of God, the beatific vision. Here philosophy ends and theology begins. Late-19th-century spread In the period from the publication of Aeterni Patris in 1879 until the 1920s, neo-scholasticism gradually established itself as exclusive and all-pervading.J√ºrgen Mettepenningen, Nouvelle Th√©ologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II, (London: T&T; Clark, 2010), p20. On October 15, 1879, Leo XIII created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas, and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so- called \\"Leonine Edition\\", of the complete works of Thomas Aquinas.Previous critical editions of Thomas‚Äôs work had been published before, at Parma in 1852-73, and in Paris in 1871-80, but the Leonine edition, produced under the guidance of Tommaso Maria Zigliara, professor of theology at the Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe (the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum), superseded both of these. Moreover, Leo XIII increased Thomist studies in his support for the Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe (the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum), by founding its Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of Canon Law in 1896. Accordingly, the thought of Thomas Aquinas came to be assessed positively in relation to all other ‚Äòmodern‚Äô systems of thought. In particular, the Aristotelianism of Thomas was seen in contrast to the thought of Kant (itself seen as representative of ‚Äòmodern‚Äô thought).For example, Boutroux thought that Aristotle's system might well serve as an offset to Kantism and evolution. Aristote, Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie, (Paris, 1901, 202). Moreover, Paulsen, ‚ÄòKant der Philosoph des Protestantismus‚Äô, Kantstudien, (1899) and Eucken, Thomas von Aquino u. Kant, Ein Kampf zweier Welten, loc. cit., 1901 declared neo-Thomism the rival of Kantism, and the conflict between them the \\"clash of two worlds\\". Adolf Harnack, Lehrbuch d. Dogmengesch, III, 3rd. ed., 327, Seeberg, Realencyklop√§die f. Prot. Theol. 5. v. \\"Scholastik\\" and others argued against underrating the value of scholastic doctrine. Other ‚Äòmodern‚Äô forms of thought, including Ontologism, Traditionalism, the dualism of Anton G√ºnther, and the thought of Descartes, were also seen as flawed in comparison to Thomism. The movement also spread into other countries. It found supporters in Germany,Such as Kleutgen (1811‚Äì83) and St√∂ckl (1823‚Äì95), and the authors of the \\"Philosophia Lacensis\\" published at Maria Laach by the Jesuits (Pesch, Hontheim, Cathrein), Gutberlet, Commer, Willmann, Kaufmann, Glossner, Grabmann and Schneid. Spain,Such as Gonzalez (1831‚Äì92), Orti y Lara, Urr√°buru, and G√≥mez Izquierdo the Netherlands,Such as de Groot Belgium,Such as de San (1832‚Äì1904), Dupont and Lepidi England,Clarke, Maher, John Rickaby, Joseph Rickaby, Boedder (Stonyhurst Series) Switzerland,Such as Mandonnet at Freiburg. France,Such as Farges, Dormet de Vorges (1910), Vallet, Gardair, Fonsegrive and Piat Hungary,Kiss and P√©csi. the United States,Such as Coppens, Poland, Brother Chrysostom, and the professors at the Catholic University (Shanahan, Turner, and Pace). Argentina,Julio Meinvielle and Nimio de Anqu√≠n Mexico,Garcia and Brazil.Santroul In Belgium, a particularly important moment was the establishment by Leo XIII at Louvain (then still a francophone university) in 1891 of the \\"Institut de philosophie\\" for the special purpose of teaching the doctrine of St. Thomas together with history and the natural sciences.The Institute was placed in charge of Mgr (later Cardinal) Mercier whose \\"Cours de philosophie\\" was translated into many major European languages. It was endorsed by four Catholic Congresses: Paris (1891); Brussels (1895); Freiburg (1897); Munich (1900). Early-20th-century development In the early 20th century, neo-Thomism became official Catholic doctrine, and became increasingly defined in opposition to Modernism. In July 1907, Pope Pius X issued the decree Lamentabili sane exitu, which condemned 65 Modernist propositions. Two months later, he issued the encyclical Pascendi Dominici Gregis, in which he unequivocally condemned the agnosticism, immanentism, and relativism of Modernism as the 'synthesis of all heresies'.Hans Boersma, Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology: A Return to Mystery, (Oxford: OUP, 2009), p18. The anti-Modernist oath of 1910 was very important; this remained in force until 1966. In 1914, Pope Pius X acted against Modernism by ordering, though the Sacred Congregation of Studies, the publication of a list of 24 philosophical propositions, propositions summarising the central tenets of neo-scholasticism to be taught in all colleges as fundamental elements of philosophy, which was intended to promote a purer form of Thomism; in 1916, these 24 propositions were confirmed as normative. In 1917, the Church's new Code of Canon Law (Codex Iuris Canonici) insisted that the doctrine, methods, and principles of Thomas should be used in teaching philosophy and theology.J√ºrgen Mettepenningen, Nouvelle Th√©ologie - New Theology: Inheritor of Modernism, Precursor of Vatican II, (London: T&T; Clark, 2010), p25. Thomist thought therefore became reflected in the manuals and textbooks widely in use in Roman Catholic colleges and seminaries before Vatican II. Variation within the tradition While writers such as Edouard Hugon, R√©ginald Garrigou-Lagrange, and Henri Grenier were maintaining the tradition of the manuals this did not mean that there was no variation or disagreement among thinkers about how best to formulate Thomism, especially in response to contemporary trends. Variation within the tradition of neo-scholastic Thomism is represented by Martin Grabmann (1875‚Äì1949), Amato Masnovo (1880‚Äì1955), Francesco Olgiati (1886‚Äì1962), and Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges (1863‚Äì1948).Battista Mondin's Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti (2002) Authors such as √âtienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Joseph Mar√©chal investigated alternative interpretations of Aquinas from the 1920s until the 1950s. Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English- speaking Catholic philosophers. The growth in historical investigation into Thomas's thought led some to believe that neo-Thomism did not always reflect the thought of Thomas Aquinas himself. This historically oriented theology was particularly carried out by writers such as √âtienne Gilson, Marie-Dominique Chenu, and Henri de Lubac. At Vatican II, traditional neo-Thomist thought was opposed by such exponents of the nouvelle th√©ologie. Many Thomists however continue in the neo-scholastic tradition. Some relatively recent proponents are treated in Battista Mondin's Metafisica di san Tommaso d'Aquino e i suoi interpreti (2002), which treats Carlo Giacon (1900‚Äì1984), Sofia Vanni Rovighi (1908‚Äì1990), Cornelio Fabro (1911‚Äì1995), Carlo Giacon (1900‚Äì1984),http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/carlo-giacon_(Dizionario- Biografico)/ Accessed 9 April 2013 Tomas Tyn (1950‚Äì1990), Abelardo Lobato (1925‚Äì2012), Leo Elders (1926‚Äì), and Enrico Berti (1935‚Äì), among others. Due to its suspicion of attempts to harmonize Aquinas with non-Thomistic categories and assumptions, neo-scholastic Thomism has sometimes been called \\"strict observance Thomism.\\" Also Edward Feser in discussing anglophone authors has indicated that proponents of the more traditional Thomist perspective such as Ralph McInerny foster the possibility of a contemporary revival of neo-scholastic Thomism.http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2008/11/neo- scholastic-revival.html Feser could be included along with these thinkers and other such as Brian Davies as engaging in a contemporary polemic in defense of the traditional system of Thomistic metaphysics in response to modern philosophy.

Akbar, a citizen of both Afghanistan and the United States, attended Diablo Valley College and transferred to Yale University. Akbar is from a political family, including Said Shamsoudin Majroh, who was the architect of Afghanistan's first constitution in 1964 and who had served as the Minister of Justice and Head of Tribal Affairs; Said Bahaoudin Majroh, who had served as Governor and was considered one of Afghanistan's leading intellectuals; and another influential member of the family was Shal Pacha, a tribal leader whose influence was particularly strong in the eastern region as well as the FATA areas of Pakistan. His father is Said Fazal Akbar, a former governor of the Kunar Province of Afghanistan. While assisting US forces, Akbar encouraged an Afghan man, Abdul Wali, to turn himself in and assured Wali he would not be mistreated. Akbar accompanied Wali to a US base, and served as a translator for David Passaro, a former special forces soldier, whom the CIA had hired, on contract, to serve as an interrogator‚Äîeven though he had no background in interrogation. Akbar later described Passaro as \\"full of rage\\" and \\"a big a--hole\\". He said he had to stop translating because Passaro became too aggressive. After Akbar left, Wali was beaten by Passaro and later died from his injuries. Based in part on Akbar's testimony and a letter from his father, who said Passaro created distrust and set back reconstruction efforts, Passaro was convicted of assault and sentenced to eight years and four months imprisonment on February 14, 2007..

Akbar has also made two documentaries for This American Life, a Peabody-winning NPR program, both broadcast during 2003 (episodes 230 and 254). The first documentary focused on life in Kabul in post-Taliban Afghanistan and the challenges that faced the central government. The second was based on time spent in Kunar, Afghanistan ‚Äì a volatile province on the border with Pakistan. Akbar's work on NPR received a National Journalism Award, a Third Coast International Silver Prize and an Overseas Press Club citation. Akbar has appeared on Morning Edition, PBS and BBC World News among others. He has also been featured in GQ, New York Magazine, and The Los Angeles Times and various other publications. Akbar has also authored articles for The New York Times and Slate. Along with his work in the media, Akbar has also been involved with Stanford University's Hoover Institution in archiving and keeping records of Afghanistan's current events. Akbar was also the co-director of Wadan Afghanistan, an NGO that he founded to focus on quick impact reconstruction projects in his native province of Kunar. The NGO rebuilt schools and helped villages with access to water among other things. Akbar is fluent in English, Pashto, Dari, Hindi, and Urdu. While at Yale, Akbar became the subject of controversy when he and two other students were arrested for arson after he burned an American flag.

Publication history The character first appeared in Fantastic Four #113 (Aug 1971). Fictional character biography The Overmind is an alien belonging to the Eternals of Eyung. He was born uncounted millennia ago on the planet Eyung (\\"Eternus\\") as Grom. Acting as one of their warlords, he led massacres of entire species. He was also the reigning champion in their gladiatorial arenas. When his race had engaged the Gigantians in a war about to lead to mutual absolute destruction, Grom was chosen for his physical prowess as the receptacle for their entire population of several hundred million minds. He was launched in a protective capsule, unconscious for thousands of years while assimilating them into one single mind. In recent years he awoke and piloted his ship to the nearest inhabited planet, Earth. There he came into contact with the Fantastic Four, who had been warned by Uatu the Watcher. The Overmind took over the mind of Mister Fantastic, and battled the Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom, who proved unable to stop him until the Stranger intervened and shrank the Overmind into a subatomic microverse on a dust mote, where he was left completely isolated with no available conquests, and went mad from the strain.Fantastic Four #113‚Äì116 He was later discovered by another collective consciousness known as Null the Living Darkness. In his current broken state Null took control of him and sent him on a campaign against a parallel universe, Earth, inhabited by the Squadron Supreme. The Overmind mentally enslaved both the Squadron and that Earth's leaders while posing as the U.S. president Kyle Richmond, and began construction of an interstellar armada to invade other worlds. When Hyperion brought the Defenders to assist him, they freed the Squadron. Meanwhile, Null had leeched away the Overmind's mental energies, but yet another psychic composite entity of seven human telepaths empowered by the assembled heroes, defeated him and inhabited the weakened Grom.Defenders #112‚Äì115 The Overmind returned with the Defenders to their Earth.Defenders #115 For a while this entity was welcomed into the Defenders' ranks, and the loose ends of the seven psychics' old lives were tied up.Defenders #117 He assisted the Defenders in the rescue of Daimon Hellstrom from the Miracle Man.Defenders #120‚Äì121 The Overmind grew uncomfortable and eventually left the Defenders, and made them forget he was ever one of them. He tried to find a purpose by attempting to help Millwood, New Hampshire, a town of 800 people dying of chemical poisoning, by controlling their minds to foster the illusion that they were well. The Overmind was convinced to cancel the illusion and allow them to live in reality.Marvel Comics Presents #40 When the Squadron transferred to this Earth, the Overmind's original psyche was stirred into awareness and absorbed the telepaths into his own billion-wide whole. His psychic powers were replenished and his true mind reasserted itself. He once more mind-controlled and kidnapped the Squadron to take revenge against the Stranger by organizing a raid against the latter's laboratory world.Quasar #13 He freed many of the Stranger's superhuman captives to fuel his enslaved ranks. He locked the Stranger in a stalemated mental battle. When several Watchers arrived on an unrelated business the Overmind was wrought by paranoia, believing the Stranger to have summoned them for assistance, inducing psychosis, and enabling the Stranger to capture him as a subject of study.Quasar #16 The Overmind's future counterpart travels back in time to present-day Squadron-Earth to aid the Scarlet Centurion in repulsing the expanding Nth Man. His head explodes from the effort and he dies.Squadron Supreme Graphic Novel He later apparently managed to escape and declined participation in the Mad Thinker's quest for vengeance against the Fantastic Four. Civil War Shortly afterwards Grom was affected by the Purple Man's mind-controlling pheromones, and used to both monitor New York's population, as the latter's chemicals spread in the water supply, as well as control potential threats like the Avengers, but disappeared after the Purple Man's defeat. He was eventually located by Baron Zemo and his Thunderbolts, during the Civil War event, and coerced to join the group or face jail time. Powers and abilities The Overmind possesses vast psychic powers derived from the synthesized intellects of the billion Eternals of Eyung composing his essence, including telepathy, telekinesis, or illusion-casting, and can use them over great distances. The Overmind can scan the thoughts of others and project his thoughts into others' minds within an unrevealed radius. His victims are completely unaware of his influence unless he allows them. Even when severely weakened, with his mind comatose and his body under the influence of the 7 telepaths, whose assembled might was likened to a drop in the ocean compared to his own, he was able to control the minds of 800 people, and at full power he managed to push the Stranger, a cosmic entity rivaling Galactus in scope, to his mental limits.

The Survey School was completed on 17 May 1794, with an initial intake of eight students. In 1858 it became the Civil Engineering School and the College of Engineering in 1861. Topping was also the first full-time modern professional surveyor of India having surveyed the seas off the Coromandel Coast, India's south-east coast. Topping came to Madras in 1785 as a marine surveyor, at the suggestion of Alexander Dalrymple, and conducted a triangulation survey of the Coromandel Coast from Madras to Masulipatnam in 1788, making us of a sextant. Topping suggested that this triangulation could be done across India, however this approach was only taken up much later by William Lambton. Topping was appointed from 1794 to survey water reservoirs and in order to conduct his \\"tank surveys\\" he sought to train (in his survey school) youths of mixed, that is, of European-Indian parentage from the Madras orphanage, and deploy them across southern India at a sixth of the allowances needed for military surveyors and without the need for interpreters. Topping persuaded astronomer William Petrie to transfer his private observatory to the government and set up the first modern astronomical observatory, the Madras Observatory, in Nungambakkam. Topping succeeded Petrie as the director of the observatory from 1789 to 1796 when he died. Topping was succeeded by John Goldingham.

In 1842, Adrien Philippe invented a mechanism for watches which allowed them to be wound and set by means of a crown rather than a key. His patented invention earned him a Bronze Medal at the French Industrial Exposition of 1844 (World's Fair). At the Exhibition, Adrien Philippe first met Antoni Patek and a year later became head watchmaker at Patek & Co. in Geneva under an agreement that entitled him to one third of all company profits. Adrien Philippe proved to be very capable at his craft and a product innovator whose value to the firm was such that by 1851 he was made a full partner and the firm began operating as Patek Philippe & Co. In 1863 he published a book in Geneva and Paris on the workings of pocket watches titled Les montres sans clef.

The clandestine organisations continued their armed struggle against the communist regime of Poland well into the 1950s. The guerrilla warfare included an array of military attacks launched against the communist regime's prisons and state security offices, detention facilities for political prisoners and concentration camps that were set up across the country. Most of the Polish anti-communist groups ceased to exist in the late 1950s, as they were hunted down by agents of the Ministry of Public Security and Soviet NKVD assassination squads. However, the last known \\"cursed soldier\\", J√≥zef Franczak, was killed in an ambush as late as 1963, almost 20 years after the Soviet take-over of Poland. The best-known Polish anti- communist resistance organisations operating in Stalinist Poland included Freedom and Independence (Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá, WIN), National Armed Forces (Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne, NSZ), National Military Union (Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe, NZW), Konspiracyjne Wojsko Polskie (Underground Polish Army, KWP), Ruch Oporu Armii Krajowej (Home Army Resistance, ROAK), Armia Krajowa Obywatelska (Citizens' Home Army, AKO), NIE (NO, short for Niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá), Armed Forces Delegation for Poland (Delegatura Si≈Ç Zbrojnych na Kraj), and Wolno≈õƒá i Sprawiedliwo≈õƒá (Freedom and Justice, WiS). Similar Central and Eastern European anti-communists fought on in other countries that were occupied by the Soviet Union. The operations and history of \\"cursed soldiers\\" has been controversial, as they have been accused of antisemitism and war crimes. Barbara Engelking suggested that the groups used anti-semitic tropes such as ≈ªydokomuna. They also committed cases of mass murder, such as the 1946 pacification of villages by PAS NZW. Historical background Monument to the Armia Krajowa in Sopot, Poland In the summer of 1944, as Soviet forces fighting against Nazi Germany advanced into Poland, the USSR set up a provisional puppet regime of Poland called the Polish Committee of National Liberation. The new regime was aware that the Polish Resistance (whose chief component was the Armia Krajowa or Home Army) and Underground State loyal to the Polish government-in-exile would have to be destroyed before they could gain complete control over Poland. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, future General Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, said that \\"Soldiers of the Armia Krajowa (AK) are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy\\". Another prominent communist, Roman Zambrowski, said that the AK had to be \\"exterminated\\". The Armia Krajowa officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 to prevent a slide into armed conflict with the Red Army and the increasing threat of civil war over Poland's sovereignty. However, many resistance units decided to continue with their struggle for Polish independence, regarding Soviet forces as new occupiers. Soviet partisans in Poland had already been ordered by Moscow on 22 June 1943 to engage Polish Le≈õni partisans in combat.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust, McFarland & Company, 1997, . Google Print, pp. 88, 89, 90. According to Marek Jan Chodakiewicz's review of Bogdan Musial's Sowjetische Partisanen book, \\"Musial‚Äôs study suggests that the Soviets seldom attacked German military and police targets. They preferred to assault the poorly armed and trained Belarusan and Polish self-defense forces. The guerrillas torched and leveled Polish landed estates much more frequently than they blew up military transports and assaulted other hard targets.\\"Review of Sowjetische Partisanen in Wei√üru√üland, by Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, in Sarmatian Review, April 2006. The main forces of the Red Army (Northern Group of Forces) and the NKVD began conducting operations against the Armia Krajowa (AK) during and directly after the launch of Operation Tempest, the aim of which was for the Polish resistance to seize control of cities and areas occupied by the Germans while the latter were preparing their defenses against the advancing Soviets.Andrzej Kaczy≈Ñski (2 October 2004), Wielkie polowanie: Prze≈õladowania akowc√≥w w Polsce Ludowej Great hunt: the persecutions of AK soldiers in the People's Republic of Poland, Rzeczpospolita, Nr 232, last accessed 21 March 2016 via Internet Archive. The Soviet leader Joseph Stalin planned to ensure that an independent Poland would never reemerge in the postwar period.Judith Olsak-Glass, Review of Piotrowski's Poland's Holocaust, in Sarmatian Review, January 1999. Formation of the anti-communist underground Uniform of a Polish anticommunist fighter, with breast badge displaying image of the Black Madonna of Czƒôstochowa The first AK structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat was NIE (short for niepodleg≈Ço≈õƒá \\"independence\\", and also meaning \\"no\\"), formed in mid-1943. NIE's goal was to observe and conduct espionage while the Polish government-in-exile decided how to deal with the Soviets, rather than to engage in combat. At that time, the exiled government still believed that negotiations could result in a solution leading to Poland's post-war independence. On 7 May 1945, NIE was disbanded and transformed into the Delegatura Si≈Ç Zbrojnych na Kraj (\\"Armed Forces Delegation for Homeland\\"). This organization lasted only until August 8, 1945, when the decision was made to disband it and to stop partisan resistance on Polish territory. In March 1945 a staged trial of 16 leaders of the Polish Underground State, who had been captured and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, took place in Moscow (the Trial of the Sixteen).Prazmowska, A.

(1946) Poland, Russia and Great Britain 1941-1945 Hollis & Carter Pages 467-468 The Polish Committee of National Liberation declined jurisdiction over former AK soldiers. Consequently, for more than a year, Soviet agencies such as the NKVD dealt with the AK. By the end of the war, approximately 60,000 soldiers of the AK had been arrested, and 50,000 of them were deported to the Soviet Union's prisons and prison camps. Most of those soldiers had been captured by the Soviets during or in the aftermath of Operation Tempest, when many AK units tried to cooperate with the Red Army during their nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other veterans were arrested when they approached the communist authorities after being promised amnesty. In 1947, the regime of the People's Republic of Poland proclaimed an amnesty for most of the wartime resistance fighters. The authorities expected around 12,000 people to give up their arms, but the total number of partisans to come out of the forests eventually reached 53,000. Many of them were arrested despite the promises of freedom. After repeated broken promises during the first few years of communist rule, former AK members refused to trust the government. After the Delegatura Si≈Ç Zbrojnych na Kraj (\\"Armed Forces Delegation for Homeland\\") was disbanded, another post-AK resistance organisation was formed, called Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá (\\"Freedom and Sovereignty\\"). Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá (WiN) was most concerned with helping former AK soldiers make the transition from a life as partisans to that of civilians, rather than any type of combat. Continued secrecy and conspiracy were necessary in light of the increasing persecution of AK veterans by the communist regime. WiN was, however, much in need of funds to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and entire life-savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, WiN was far from efficient. A significant victory for the NKVD and the newly created Polish secret police, UrzƒÖd Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa (UB), came in the second half of 1945, when they convinced several leaders of WiN that they truly wanted to offer amnesty to AK members. Within a few months, intelligence gathered by the authorities led to thousands more arrests. The primary period of WiN activity lasted until 1947. The organisation finally disbanded in 1952. Persecution communist propaganda poster showing a soldier of the Polish People's Army striding over a partisan of the Armia Krajowa (Home Army). The NKVD and UB used brute force and deception to eliminate the underground opposition. In the autumn of 1946, a group of 100‚Äì200 \\"cursed soldiers\\" of Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne (National Armed Forces, NSZ) were lured into a trap and massacred. In 1947, Colonel Julia (\\"Bloody Luna\\") Brystiger of the Polish Ministry of Public Security proclaimed at a security briefing that: \\"the terrorist and political underground\\" had ceased to be a threatening force for the UB, although the \\"class enemy\\" at universities, offices and factories still had to be \\"found out and neutralised.\\" The persecution of AK members was only one aspect of the reign of Stalinist terror in postwar Poland. In the period from 1944 to 1956, at least 300,000 Polish civilians were arrested. Some sources claim numbers up to two million arrested. Approximately 6,000 death sentences were issued, and the majority of them were carried out. It is probable that more than 20,000 people died in communist prisons including those executed \\"in the majesty of the law\\", such as Witold Pilecki, a hero of Auschwitz. A further six million Polish citizens (i.e., one out of every three adult Poles) were classified as suspected members of a 'reactionary or criminal element' and subjected to investigation by state agencies. During the Polish October of 1956, a political amnesty freed 35,000 former AK soldiers from prisons. But, some partisans remained in service, unwilling or simply unable to rejoin the civilian community. The cursed soldier Stanis≈Çaw Marchewka \\"Ryba\\" (\\"The Fish\\") was killed in 1957, and the last AK partisan, J√≥zef Franczak \\"Lalek\\" (\\"Doller\\"), was killed in 1963 ‚Äî almost two decades after the Second World War ended. In 1967, long after the abolition of Stalinist terror, Adam Boryczka, the last member of the elite British-trained Cichociemny (\\"The Silent and Hidden\\") intelligence and support group, was finally released from prison. Until the end of the People's Republic of Poland, former AK soldiers were under constant investigation by the secret police. It was only in 1989, after the fall of communism, that the convictions of AK soldiers were finally declared invalid and annulled by Polish law. The largest operations and actions The biggest battle in the history of the National Military Union (Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe, NZW) took place on 6‚Äì7 May 1945, in the village of Kury≈Ç√≥wka in southeastern Poland. In the Battle of Kury≈Ç√≥wka, the partisans fought against the Soviet 2nd Border Regiment of the NKVD, gaining a victory for the underground forces commanded by Major Franciszek Przysiƒô≈ºniak (\\"Marek\\"). The anti-communist fighters killed up to 70 Soviet agents. The NKVD troops retreated in haste, only to return to the village later and burn it to the ground in retaliation, destroying over 730 buildings.Norman Davies, No Simple Victory, Viking Penguin, 2006. On 21 May 1945, a heavily armed AK unit led by Colonel Edward Wasilewski, attacked and destroyed the NKVD camp located in Rembert√≥w on the eastern outskirts of Warsaw. The Soviets had incarcerated hundreds of Polish citizens there,Norman Davies, Rising '44, 2004, Viking Penguin, , p. 495Norman Davies, Rising '44, 2003, Macmillan, , p. 495Norman Davies, Rising '44, 2004, Pan, , p. 497 including members of the Armia Krajowa.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust: Ethnic Strife, Collaboration with Occupying Forces and Genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947, McFarland & Company, 1998, , p.131 ( Google Print) Pacification One of the biggest anti-partisan operations by the communist authorities took place from 10‚Äì25 June 1945, in and around the Suwa≈Çki and August√≥w regions of Poland. The \\"August√≥w roundup\\" () was a joint operation of the Red Army, the Soviet NKVD, and SMERSH battalions, with assistance from Polish UB and LWP units, against Armia Krajowa resistance fighters. The operation extended into the territory of occupied Lithuania. More than 2,000 suspected anti-communist Polish fighters were captured and detained in Soviet internment camps. About 600 of the \\"Augustow Missing\\" are presumed to have died in Soviet custody, their bodies buried in unknown mass graves on the present territory of Russia. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance has declared the 1945 August√≥w roundup to be \\"the largest crime committed by the Soviets on Polish lands after World War II.\\" Anti- communist resistance organizations Among the best-known Polish underground organizations, engaged in guerrilla warfare were: # Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá (\\"Freedom and Independence\\", WIN) founded on September 2, 1945, active to 1952. # Narodowe Si≈Çy Zbrojne (\\"National Armed Forces\\", NSZ) created on September 20, 1942, split in March 1944. # Narodowe Zjednoczenie Wojskowe (\\"National Military Union\\", NZW) established in mid-to-late 1940s, active until mid-1950s. # Konspiracyjne Wojsko Polskie (\\"Underground Polish Army\\", KWP) which existed from April 1945 to as late as 1954. # Ruch Oporu Armii Krajowej (\\"Resistance of the Home Army\\", ROAK) formed in 1944 against UB collaborators. # Armia Krajowa Obywatelska (\\"Citizens' Home Army\\", AKO) founded in February 1945, incorporated into Wolno≈õƒá i Niezawis≈Ço≈õƒá in 1945. # NIE (\\"NO\\") formed in 1943, active till 7 May 1945. # Delegatura Si≈Ç Zbrojnych na Kraj (\\"Delegature of the Polish Forces at Home\\") formed on May 7, 1945, dissolved on August 8, 1945. # Wolno≈õƒá i Sprawiedliwo≈õƒá (\\"Freedom and Justice\\", WIS) founded in early 1950s.

It has dense brown/black fur, short wooly ears, and a plush muzzle. It is often under reported because of its small size, strict nocturnal activity, and elusiveness. This species is not sexually dimorphic in color but there are slight differences in size. Martinoli et al. Tail is wide and bushy, They and their other closely related cousin, the Black- footed mongoose, have large posterior cusps on their p3 tooth. These expanded molars indicate that it is primarily an insectivore, although other carnivorous habits have been documented. To reveal more information on the size of these animals, Martinoli et al. caught 5 individuals that were then marked and recaptured in Arusha NP. After taking measurements, averages revealed: Head- Body length (mm): 407 M/ 383 F; Tail-length (mm): 230 M&F; Foot length (mm): 77.7 M/ 74.9 F; and body mass (g): 1273 M/ 1300 F (M being males and F being females). Overall it is usually long and weighs around .  Phylogeny  The ancestral state of the mongoose family had all of these attributes: a strong sagittal crest, presence of superior premolar, absence of posterior cusp on P3, and short claws on the forefoot. The bushy tailed mongoose is closely related to the black-footed mongoose (Bdeogale nigripes). Perez's study of genes within the family Herpestidae showed the genus Bdeogale is monophyletic. Close cousins of this clade include the genera Ichneumia and Cynictis. Evolution has selected for foot specialization within the Bdeogale family. Suppression of pollex and hallux bones and shortening of other digits have led this family to have only 4 toes on both the hindlimbs and forelimbs (symmetrical toes). Subspecies * B. c. crassicauda, central Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia * B. c. nigrescens, Central Kenya (Nairobi) * B. c. omnivora, found in northern coastal Tanzania and Kenya, is classified by the IUCN as endangered (as B. omnivora) * B. c. puisa, northern Mozambique and southern Tanzania * B. c. tenuis, found in Zanzibar, is classified as lower risk/least concern.  Preferred Habitat  Because of this animals size and stealthiness, the range in which they occur is not completely known. Although, it has been documented that they prefer locations that are easy for them to hide in that are also near rivers. An experiment by Pettorelli et al. was carried out in northern Tanzania using camera traps to find out total species distribution. Bushy tailed mongooses were spotted in over 31 different trap locations. The study even showed the Bushy tailed mongoose persists in locations not previously known (Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Biharamulo- Burigi-Kimisi Game Reserve, and Mahale Mountains National Park). In the locations recorded, the camera trap data shows this species prefers Acacia woodlands and riparian zones. An interesting thing to note is they also showed avoidance to croplands and open areas. Capture- mark- recapture experiments by Martinoli et al. showed that Bushy Tailed mongooses used open shrubland 14.3% of the time and multilayered forest 85.7% of time. These areas where the animals were caught have low environmental variance like temperature, humidity, etc. The researchers inferred that Bushy tailed mongooses have a low tolerance to environmental change. For this information to true, they suggested repeating the experiment in other places this species is known to be found.  Conservation Strategies  As said by Petteorelli et al. and Martinolli et al., this species has a strict range of tolerance and specific habitat preference. Although this species is listed by the IUCN as of least concern, habitat degradation and fragmentation could cause many problems for this species including land use dynamics (shifting its territory to grazing area for cattle) and prey depletion. The potential for illicit harvesting of its own species could become a concern as well. In Martinoli et al. they assumed that by decreasing areas of National Parks, it might force increased predation by larger predators (servals, caracals, and other canid predators).

The Macau Basic Law guarantees freedom of religion and the residents of Macau have the right to practice a religion of their choice. Based on Article 3:34, \\"the people in Macau are free to participate in religious activities and to preach as they wish\\". In Article 3:120, \\"the Macau Special Administrative Region embraces the principle of freedom of religion and belief; the government will not interfere in the internal workings of a religious body or organization and the believers are free to maintain ties and to develop relationships with overseas religious organizations outside Macau\\". Religious organizations can found religious colleges or other schools, hospitals and welfare organizations in accordance with the law. Schools operated by religious institutions can teach their religion. Religious organizations have the right to use, handle, inherit and obtain financial contributions in accordance with the law. Their right to wealth is protected by the law. Chinese folk religion or Shenism The A-Ma Temple. Kun Iam Temple. The Chinese folk religion, also named Shenism, is the indigenous religion of the Han Chinese. Its focus is the worship of the shen (Á•û \\"expressions\\", \\"gods\\"), that are the generative powers of nature, also including, in the human sphere, ancestors and progenitors of families or lineages, and divine heroes that made a significant imprinting in the history of the Chinese civilisation. In Macau, one of the most worshipped deities is Mazu. The name \\"Macau\\" itself derives from a Portuguese version of the local name of Mazu, Maa Gok Â™ΩÈñ£ (pinyin: MƒÅg√©; Jyutping: Maa1 Gok3). Confucianism The culture of Macau is influenced by Confucian values and morality. In 1909, the Macau Confucian Association was created. The organization was at first an offshoot of the Beijing Confucian Association, but later gained independence. The purpose of the Macau Confucian Association is to \\"respect the principles of Confucianism, to spread the holy virtue, provide education for those with aptitude and promote the culture\\". To this end, in 1913 the organization started a small school in Macau. In 1960, the organization printed a selection of the sayings of Confucius for use in secondary schools. It has collected about 74 sayings from the Analects of Confucius, Mencius (Book) and other Confucian classics, in order to help students to memorize and recite them. On the birthday of Confucius, which is celebrated on 27 August of the lunar calendar, the organization holds a ceremony of commemoration and sacrifice at which school students are invited to take part. Taoism Taoism was first introduced to Macau in the third century. Elements of it have since largely been practiced alongside Buddhism. Buddhism The Government Information Bureau reports that nearly 80% of the population practices Buddhism. Buddhism is the predominant religion in Macau as the cultural and historical backgrounds support or reflects Buddhism. Most of the people in Macau hold a great belief towards Buddhism, despite only practicing occasionally. Other estimates shows that Buddhism and folk religions together make 92% of the total population. Christianity Catholic Church St. Dominic's Church. St. Joseph's Church Catholicism is a lasting legacy of the Portuguese colonial control of Macau. The Catholic Church in Macau is organized through the Diocese of Macau, which follows the Roman (or Latin) Rite. This Catholic diocese was established on 23 January 1576 by Pope Gregory XIII, and is currently limited in extent to the territory of the Special Administrative Region (MSAR) of the People's Republic of China. Since 2016, Bishop Stephen Lee Bun-sang has been at the head of this diocese. Macau became a diocese of the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century, after the arrival of the Portuguese. At its foundation, the Diocese of Macau was given a wide jurisdiction over various ecclesiastical territories in the Far East, such as China, Japan, Vietnam and Malaysia (but not the Philippines). It became a major training and departure point for Catholic missionaries to different countries in Asia. To further strengthen this role, a college was founded in S√£o Paulo in the sixteenth century, the first Western college in Asia for the training of missionaries. In the eighteenth century, the Seminary of St. Joseph was also established to train missionaries and priests. According to the Pontifical Yearbook 2004, there were about 18,000 practicing Catholics in Macau in that year (representing about 4% of the total population), 24 secular priests, 52 religious priests (members of religious orders), 62 brothers and 183 sisters in the territory. According to government statistics, Catholics in Macau, in 2005, numbered about 27,000 (about 5.6% of the total population) and most of them were members of the Chinese community, with some Portuguese, people of the Eurasian community with Portuguese descent and thousands of other foreigners, including many Filipinos. There has been a progressive decline in the use of the Portuguese language in the liturgy and increasingly, Mass and other sacraments are celebrated in other languages. For example, as of 2019, Mass is celebrated 30 times every Sunday in Macau: 16 times in Cantonese, 7 times in English, 4 times in Portuguese, 2 times in Mandarin and 1 time in Vietnamese. Recent government surveys have indicated that Catholicism is declining among Macau's population. Although the Catholic Church is not the predominant religion in Macau, it continues to influence and engage in areas such as social work and education. The Diocese of Macau has six parishes and 24 social institutions, made up of eight daycare centres, six nursing homes for the elderly, five rehabilitation centres for the mentally and physically disabled and five children's homes. In the field of education, in the 2004/2005 school year, the Catholic Church taught in 31 schools, to over 36,000 students and over the years, a large number of influential non- Christians have received a Christian education. In addition, there is a Portuguese Catholic university, an educational institution of higher education known as the Inter-University Institute of Macau. Among the important annual events are the Good Friday procession and the Feast of Our Lady of Fatima procession. Protestantism Macau Protestant Chapel, an Anglican parish church. In 1807, the Reverend Dr Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary to China, landed at Macau. Morrison's main objective was to reach the Chinese living in Guangzhou and he started his missionary work there straight away. It was only later that he founded a Chinese Protestant church in Macau itself. Following the Opium War of 1842, the Qing Dynasty gave Hong Kong to the United Kingdom and most Protestant missionaries and British subjects who lived in Macau moved to Hong Kong. As most of the British were Protestants, the Macau Protestant population was reduced to only a handful for a long time. By the 20th century, some Chinese Protestants were meeting in people's homes. The most famous Chinese Christians to open their homes for meetings were Mr Lui De Shan and Dr Yu Mei De. With the support of churches in Hong Kong, Ji Dou Church was founded. This was the first Chinese Protestant church in Macau (its original name was Ji Dou Hall). It was registered with the Portuguese colonial government in 1905 and the church building was constructed at Hei Sha Huan. The Macau Baptist Church, the second Chinese Protestant church in Macau, was built soon after and following this, a number of Chinese Protestant churches were founded. When the Victoria Diocese of the Anglican Communion was established in 1849, it included Macau as well as Hong Kong. When the Province of Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui was established in 1912, Macau was included with Hong Kong and Guangdong. In 1951, following the communist take over in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau left the Diocese and established the Sheng Kung Hui Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau. Following the end of the British administration of Hong Kong in 1997, in 1998 the Diocese was succeeded by the Province of Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (commonly called the Hong Kong Anglican Church). Today there are about 4,000 practicing Protestants in Macau with an average of just 50 people participating and worshipping in services at each church. Many churches in Macau were founded by different communities from Hong Kong and other countries, representing the Anglican Church, the Baptist Church and the Lutheran Church, but historically there was little cooperation between them. When the Union of Christian Evangelical Churches in Macau was founded in 1990, a new era of cooperation began. In 2006, the 7th Chinese Congress on World Evangelization was held in Macau, further inspiring the Protestant churches in Macau to unite. Due to pressure in the past from the Portuguese colonial government and the Roman Catholic Church, Protestant churches were allowed to do only limited social, pastoral and educational work. They were also limited by poor funding and many Protestant schools were closed after the \\"3/12 movement\\", which reduced even further the role of the Protestant churches in education in Macau. There are only seven remaining Protestant primary and secondary schools in Macau. There are, however, some rehabilitation programmes run by Protestant organisations that receive government support. A Protestant counselling service was started by the Macau Chinese Christian Mission in 2005. Missionaries are free to conduct missionary activities and are active in Macau.  Other religions   Islam  Macau Mosque Islam has been present in Macau since before the Ming Dynasty. Although the exact period and manner of its introduction is disputed, it is traditionally held that it was brought to the area by Arab and Persian traders. During World War II, a large number of ethnic Hui Muslims fled to Macau to escape the devastation in the rest of the country. In 2007, Macau had one mosque and Muslim cemetery, the Macau Mosque and Cemetery, to serve the city's more than four hundred Muslims that associate under the name of \\"The Macau Islamic Society\\". This mosque was under renovation in the late months of 2007 and planned to double in size in order to provide a more modern mosque in the heart of Macau. Both Muslims and Roman Catholics sometimes choose to name one of their children Fatima, Omar or Soraya.

Birth/background Andresen was born in Deerfield, Michigan on April 8, 1907. She was the daughter of Reverend Earl Rice, a Methodist minister, and Josephine Mills. Her parents motivated their seven children to be highly focused and productive, particularly with education. By the time Andresen was fourteen, she had read and consumed the Harvard Classics and the entire works of Shakespeare, which her father encouraged her to read. She was very lively in high school and had participated in sports, drama, and music; she was also an accomplished pianist. Her nickname at Adrian High School was \\"Rollicking Rachel\\". She also did the unthinkable: she bobbed her hair, much to the dismay of her conservative parents. She graduated top of her class when she was sixteen years old. It was also at this time that she met her future husband, Henry Rose. Andresen attended the Detroit Conservatory of Music and received a BFA in music. Marriage After Andresen and Rose were married, she helped to support their income by giving piano lessons while he attended the University of Michigan. They were one of the few married couples on campus. They had three children and Rose was beginning to establish himself in engineering when tragedy struck. Rose died in the encephalitis epidemic of 1934, at the height of the Great Depression. Andresen was left with three children to raise alone and not many people opted to spend money on piano lessons at that time. Andresen decided that the only way she could make it was by returning to school. She decided to study social work, and received her MSW (Master's in Social Work) in a year and a half. YWCA Andresen began her work with the YWCA in Detroit and also became the director of Camp Talahi. During the rest of the year she did a lot of inner-city work in Detroit. In 1942 she purchased a large farm house on 82 acres near South Lyon, Michigan; this would become known as Pinebrook. It was transformed into both a summer camp and a hostel for international travelers year around. Andresen met her second husband, Arvid Andresen, a Danish landscape architect, who was on excursion and stayed at the hostel. She became involved with the Michigan Council of Churches. By the end of World War II, the Council was responsible for helping to re-build Europe by providing Michigan cattle and humanitarian assistance. Andresen was approached by the Ann Arbor Rotarians to set up an exchange student program in 1951 to help bridge the enormous rift of post-war hatred. This began with a handful of German students who would live in Michigan for one year. Andresen was apprehensive of how well the concept of American families taking in students of a former enemy would be received. She managed to place all the students, many of whom barely had enough clothes to fit into one small suitcase. At the beginning of the school year they stayed at Pinebrook before they went to their host families to attend high schools in various communities in Michigan. At the end of their academic year they stayed at Pinebrook again, speaking perfect English and having been enveloped by American culture. YFU On the day the students left for home, hundreds of people - host families, teachers, and students from their schools - turned out to say goodbye. The students left with suitcases of new clothes, lifelong friends, and understanding. Andresen realized it was impossible to hate someone (or even a country) one actually knows and understands on a family and community level. This was the basic concept of Youth For Understanding. Andresen was YFU's founder and first executive director. The YFU program began at a very grassroots level, and evolved and snowballed into a giant organization in the 25 years Andresen was at the helm. What began with a small group of students from one country ended up as a vast and global network of peace and understanding. She called the participants student ambassadors. She championed volunteerism, local politics and empowerment programs but she also relished having more time with her family and with her piano and her gardening. She continued to travel extensively abroad and in the states. When she was 78 she even rode the mechanical bull at Gilley's Club, wearing a cowboy hat, while visiting her eldest son. Death and posthumous honours Andresen died on November 3, 1988, aged 81. In 1991, she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.

It appears to be rare and has been classified as Near Threatened since 2008. Its long and dense fur is grizzled black and white. The cheeks, throat and sides of the neck are yellowish. The legs are dark brown or black, and the bushy tail is white. With a head and body length of more than and a body weight of , it is a large mongoose. It is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular and possibly solitary. It feeds on rodents and insects.  Taxonomy Galeriscus jacksoni was the scientific name proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1894 based on a skin of a badger-like animal collected by Frederick John Jackson in Kenya. He specified the type locality as Mianzini in Maasailand at an elevation of . The generic name Galeriscus was recognised as a valid taxon by Paul Matschie, Glover Morrill Allen and Donovan Reginald Rosevear. Jackson's mongoose was placed in the genus Bdeogale by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1916, who recognised that the animal was a mongoose and considered Galeriscus a synonym of Bdeogale. This classification has been widely followed.  Characteristics  Jackson's mongoose is silvery grey with yellowish cheeks, throat and sides of the neck, a grizzled grey crown, but a brownish white muzzle and chin and a few brown hairs around the eyes. Its round ears are grizzled grey outside and yellowish inside. Its belly is light grey, its legs blackish brown or black, and the tip of the tail white. The dorsal hair is long with black and white rings, and it has dense and woolly underfur. The muzzle is blunt. The rhinarium is large, and the hairless extension of the median groove divides the upper lip. The fore and hind feet have only four digits without hallux and pollex. The soles are naked, and the claws are thick and strong. It is a large mongoose with a head and body length of and a long bushy tail. Its hind foot is long and its ear long. It weighs [. The dental formula is , with three incisors, one canine, four premolars and two molars on either side of the jaw. Young but already breeding animals may be markedly smaller than adults. From the black-footed mongoose, it is distinguishable by its much longer fur, especially on the tail, and yellowish tints on neck and throat.  Distribution and habitat  Jackson's mongoose is distributed in central and southern Kenya and southeastern Uganda, where it was recorded in the Aberdare Range, Mount Kenya and the Mount Elgon mountains at elevations from . It inhabits lowland forests, bamboo and montane forests. In Tanzania's Udzungwa Mountains, it was first recorded in 2002 in the Matundu Forest.  Behaviour and ecology  Jackson's mongoose is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular. In the Udzungwa Mountains, most of the 25 camera trap photos were taken by night. It is possibly solitary, but was also recorded in pairs and occasionally in groups of four. Nothing is known about its reproduction. It probably hunts frequently in the thick herbaceous vegetation around swamps. It is an omnivore. Analysis of 40 feces samples collected in the Aberdare Mountains revealed that they contained remains of army ants, beetles, weevils, millipedes and caterpillars, rodents including Otomys, Dasymys and Praomys, as well as snails, lizards, and snake eggs. The diet of juveniles consisted foremost of rodents and insects. Feeding on army ants may be a recent evolutionary adaptation to this diet.  Conservation  Jackson's mongoose occurs in isolated populations and appears to be rare. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2008, assuming a declining population size within the last 10 years due to habitat destruction. Given its dependence on forest habitat, its main threat is likely to be ongoing forest loss. It has been recorded in protected areas such Aberdare National Park, Mount Kenya National Park and Udzungwa Mountains National Park. It is suspected to also live in Mount Elgon National Park and probably more widely distributed than currently known. Full protection of forests adjacent to the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and a survey in other groundwater-dependent forests in the region has been recommended.

In 1871 he won a place at St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated MA before continuing multiple postgraduate studies, gaining several doctorates. He spent his entire career at Cambridge University, beginning as a Demonstrator in lectures in 1875.

Langley is known as one of the fathers of the chemical receptor theory, and as the origin of the concept of \\"receptive substance\\". In 1901, he advanced research in neurotransmitters and chemical receptors, working with extracts from adrenal glands. These extracts elicited responses in tissues that were similar to those induced by nerve stimulation. He died in Cambridge on 5 November 1925.

He held a Ph.D. in musicology and was considered one of the so-called \\"new comedy\\" performers, a new generation of unabashed intellectuals that also included Mort Sahl, Nichols and May, and Lenny Bruce. Gottlieb's trademark on stage was a burlesquing of the university pedant, the sort of teacher who knocks himself out over the jokes in Chaucer while his class has nothing on its collective mind earlier than last night's date. \\"Many of the things I have been enthusiastic about,\\" said Gottlieb, \\"mean absolutely nothing to most people.\\" Early life Gottlieb grew up in La Crescenta, California, completed his B.A. at UCLA, performed as jazz pianist, then sang with the Gateway Singers, whom he left to take a Ph.D. in music at U.C. Berkeley in 1958. Gottlieb had completed his doctoral thesis on 15th century cyclic masses when he heard Alex Hassilev and Glenn Yarbrough sing together at Hollywood's Cosmo Alley nightclub. He joined the group, which they named The Limeliters after the Limelite Club in Aspen, Colorado. The Limeliters In July 1959, The Limeliters appeared as a trio for the first time at the hungry i in San Francisco, with Gottlieb as \\"the comic-arranger- musicologist, Glenn the golden-voiced tenor and guitarist, and Alex the instrumental virtuoso\\" (to quote from one of their song collections, \\"Cheek In Our Tongue\\"). San Francisco music critic John L. Wasserman said the Limeliters \\"attained a stature equalled perhaps only by The Kingston Trio and The Weavers.\\" The group's biggest hit was \\"A Dollar Down\\" in 1961, but it was well known for its 15 albums and its concerts during the 1960s. The group disbanded after a near- fatal plane crash near the Provo airport in December 1962. During the 1970s, The Limeliters embarked on a series of yearly reunion tours with Glenn Yarbrough. These were so successful that Gottlieb and Hassilev decided in 1981 to get back into the mainstream of entertainment. It was then they introduced a new tenor, Red Grammer, and another come-back began. After a brief stint reviewing concerts for the San Francisco Chronicle, Gottlieb moved to Morning Star Ranch, his ranch in Sonoma County, in 1966. Folk singer Malvina Reynolds and her husband Bud had alerted him to the property, which was also known as \\"The Digger Farm\\". Gottlieb referred to himself as the \\"resident piano player\\". He attempted to leave the land he owned to God, but a series of court appeals culminated in the 9th district court ruling that he could not. The ruling centered around the fact that if God was named owner on a quit claim deed, there would be no recourse for the collection of property taxes. Movie roles Gottlieb performed in the 1968 movie I Love You, Alice B. Toklas with Peter Sellers, and in Blume in Love with George Segal in 1973. World Folk Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award In 1995, Gottlieb received the World Folk Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award.

Most live in the funnelwebs of spiders in the family Dipluridae. M. archeri lives on webs of a species in the family Pholcidae, M. capae and M. cienga have been observed living in Cyrtophora (Araneidae) webs. One reason why diplurid webs are preferred seems to be that they are persistent in time and space, sometimes spanning several years. The monotypic genus Isela is closely related. Mysmenopsis furtiva from Jamaica lives as a kleptoparasite and commensal in webs of Ischnothele xera. It steals portions of its host's prey, but also consumes minute trapped insects that are not sought after by the host. In order not to be recognized, it moves only slowly when the host does not move; else it synchronizes its rapid movements with the movements of the host. M. furtiva has been observed to feed on one end of a prey animal, while the host feeds on the other. When feeding, its legs and pedipalps remain motionless, but its abdomen sways slowly and slightly. One feeding bout can double its abdominal volume. The host shows anti-kleptoparasite behavior, amongst others by adding silk between the kleptoparasite and the feeding site. The closely related M. furtiva and M. monticola parasitize two spider species that are also closely related, and it is believed that the two groups coevolved.

Typically used for looking for small changes relative to a known DNA sequence. PDF The binding of one strand of DNA to its complementary strand in the DNA double-helix (known as hybridization) is sensitive to even single-base mismatches when the hybrid region is short or if specialized mismatch detection proteins are present. This is exploited in a variety of ways, most notably via DNA chips or microarrays with thousands to billions of synthetic oligonucleotides found in a genome of interest plus many known variations or even all possible single- base variations. The type of sequencing by hybridization described above has largely been displaced by other methods, including sequencing by synthesis, and sequencing by ligation (as well as pore-based methods).

The language is used to write the operating system and other system utilities, although it can also be used to write user software as well. Several constructs separate it from extended ALGOL on which it is based. Language operators such as \`MEMORY\` which allows direct memory access are strictly used by programs running as the MCP. Main constructs NEWP is a block-structured language very similar to Extended ALGOL. It includes several features borrowed from other programming languages which help in proper software engineering. These include modules (and later, super-modules) which group together functions and their data, with defined import and export interfaces. This allows for data encapsulation and module integrity. Since NEWP is designed for use as an operating system language, it permits the use of several unsafe constructs. Each block of code can have specific unsafe elements permitted. Unsafe elements are those only permitted within the operating system. These include access to the tag of each word, access to arbitrary memory elements, low-level machine interfaces, etc. If a program does not make use of any unsafe elements, it can be compiled and executed by anyone. If any unsafe elements are used, the compiler marks the code as non-executable. It can still be executed if blessed by a security administrator. Folklore NEWP is rumored to really stand for \\"Nearly Every Word Pascal\\" after a West coast engineering initiative to move Burroughs languages such as ALGOL over to a more Pascal-like syntax. Stories were also told that it stands for \\"No Executive Washroom Privileges,\\" supposedly after its designers fell out of favor with management. Alternately, NEWP was chosen as the name of the compiler/language at the spur of the moment, by the designer, when pressed for a name under which the compiler code would be managed. It stood for \\"NEW Programming language\\", an essentially dull name, with the unhappy property that the \\"new\\" part of the name would quickly become inappropriate. The original designer of the project was a Texan and soon started to describe the name as the answer to the question, \\"Is it done yet?\\". NEWP sounded like a West Texas version of \\"nope\\". Once the project was released, the name was \\"redefined\\" to stand for \\"No Executive Washroom Privileges\\" - a description of the type of person who would likely use the language. For a while a contest ran to come up with a better name for the compiler and language, but by that time the name NEWP had sunk its roots too deeply.

Scriptorum veterum nova collectio , III, 2, p. 183 sq. who died in 546 or 547. Biography Little is known of his early life. At the end of his life, he was a deacon of the Church of Carthage, and a renowned theologian, consulted in 546 by the Roman deacons Pelagius and Anatolius on the affair of the Three Chapters which had just broken out. Ferrand's reply was retained, but Facundus of Hermiane, writing in the winter of 546/47 Facundus d'Hermiane, Pro defensione trium capitulorum , IV, 3. recounts this consultation by referring to Ferrand as \\" [...] laudabilis in Christo memori√¶ Ferrando Carthaginiensi diacono scripserunt\\". He probably accompanied his master and patron, Fulgentius of Ruspe, to exile in Sardinia, when the bishops of the African Church were banished from their sees by the Arian King of the Vandals, Thrasamund. After the death of Thrasamund and the accession of Hilderic, in 523, the exiles were permitted to return, and Fulgentius, although only a deacon, soon gained a position of great importance in the African Church. He was frequently consulted in regard to the complex theological problems of the time and was known as one of the most redoubtable champions of orthodoxy in Western Christendom. Through no desire of his own, he was forced to take an active part in the controversy brought about through the condemnation of the Three Chapters by the Emperor Justinian. At the request of Pope Vigilius the Roman deacons Pelagius and Anatolius submitted the questions involved in the emperor's censure of the works of Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret of Cyrus and Ibas of Edessa, to their Carthaginian confrere, requesting him at the same time to lay the matter before the African bishops. Ferrandus at once declared himself in the most emphatic manner against yielding to the schemes of the emperor (Ep. vi, ad Pelagium et Anatolium diaconos). His decision met with the approval of Rusticus, Archbishop of Carthage, and was subsequently ratified by the council of African bishops over which Rusticus presided, and in which it was agreed to sever all relations with Pope Vigilius. Ferrandus died shortly after this event and before the Second Council of Constantinople was convened in 553. Writings His works are mostly of a doctrinal character. He defended the Trinitarian doctrines against the Arians and dealt besides with the question of the two natures in Christ, with baptism, and with the Eucharist. He drew up a \\"Breviatio Canonum Ecclesiasticorum\\" in which he summarized in two hundred and thirty-two canons the teaching of the earliest ecumenical councils concerning the manner of life of bishops, priests, deacons and other ecclesiastics, and of the conduct to be observed towards Jews, pagans and heretics. He also wrote at the request of the Comes Reginus (who was probably military governor of North Africa) a treatise on the Christian rule of life for soldiers, in which he laid down seven rules which he explained and inculcated and gave evidence of his piety and practical wisdom. Life of Fulgence of Ruspe Since Pierre Pithou wrote in 1588 he was generally considered the author of the Life of Fulgence of Ruspe. However, this attribution is not based on any indication of the many manuscripts. Two letters of Ferrand about Fulgence are preserved, where he questions him on points of religion, and there are corresponding answers from Fulgence. At the end of a letter to the Abbe Eugippe , written just after the death of Fulgence ( 532 ), Ferrand evokes the projected drafting of a Life, but without positively saying the author. If Ferrand is the author of this Life, we learn in the prologue that he lived in the little monastery which Bishop Fulgence had founded during his relegation to Sardinia . But one of the last editors of the text, Antonino Isola, casts doubt on his authorship to the point of talking about \\"Pseudo-Ferrand\\".Antonio Isola, \\"Sulla paternit√† della Vita Fulgentii \\", Vetera christianorum , vol. 23, 1986, p. 63-71. and choosing to nominate Redemptus a monk of Telepte as the author. Letters Also Ferrand preserves seven lettersPierre Pithou (ed.), Fulgentii Ferrandi Carthaginiensis Ecclesi√¶ diaconi Breviatio canonum , Paris , 1588.Pierre-Fran√ßois Chifflet (ed.), Fulgentii Ferrandi Carthaginiensis Ecclesi√¶ diaconi opera , Dijon , 1649. transmitted in bulk: the two by which he interrogates Fulgence de Ruspe (the first on the question of whether an Ethiopian catechumen, died while administered baptism, was saved, the second on dogma Of the Trinity and the question of whether the divinity of Christ suffered on the cross), and five others, some very long, which are true little treatises on theology (notably the answer to the deacons Pelagius and Anatolius on the Three Chapters, by which he pronounced against the edict of Justinian, or the very long letter to Count Reginus on the duties of a Christian officer, presented in the form of seven rules. The letter to Eugippe, formerly known in a truncated version (still reproduced in PL ), was published for the first time in its integral version in 1828 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, according to a manuscript of Mount Cassin. On the other hand, Ferrand is the author of the Breviatio canonum ecclesiasticorum, a collection of 232 canons enacted by the oldest Greek and African councils, first published by Pierre Pithou.

It occurred on 4 July 1843 at the Beacon Course racetrack in Hoboken, New Jersey, when she was more than ten years old. One author attributed the song to Stephen Foster, although the composer is usually listed as unknown.

Born in Farranree, Cork, O'Sullivan first played competitive Gaelic games during his schooling at the North Monastery. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of sixteen when he first linked up with the Cork minor teams as a dual player before later joining the under-21 sides. He made his senior hurling debut during the 1982 championship. O'Sullivan immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and won three All-Ireland medals, seven Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on three occasions. As a member of the Munster inter- provincial team on a number of occasions, O'Sullivan won one Railway Cup medal on the field of play. At club level he is a two-time championship medallist with Na Piarsaigh. O'Sullivan's career tally of 1 goals and 143 points ranks him as one of Cork's highest championship scorers of all-time. Throughout his career O'Sullivan made 39 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1995 championship. In retirement from playing O'Sullivan became involved in team management and coaching. He has served as a selector with the Cork under-21 and senior teams. During his playing days, O'Sullivan won five All-Star awards as well as being named Texaco Hurler of the Year in 1990. O'Sullivan was also chosen as one of the 125 greatest hurlers of all-time in a 2009 poll, while he was also selected as one of Cork's greatest players of the era in a 2013 selection. Playing career College During his schooling at the North Monastery, O'Sullivan established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team. In 1980 he won a Harty Cup medal following a 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì5 replay defeat of St. Colman's College. On 27 April 1980 the North Mon faced St. Brendan's Community School in the All-Ireland decider. A 5‚Äì11 to 3‚Äì7 victory gave O'Sullivan an All- Ireland medal. Club After enjoying championship success in the minor and under-21 grades with Na Piarsaigh, O'Sullivan subsequently joined the senior team. After losing the 1987 championship decider to Midleton, the club qualified for the final again in 1990. Southside kingpins St. Finbarr's provided the opposition, however, the game ended level. The replay was also a close affair, however, a narrow 2‚Äì7 to 1‚Äì8 victory gave O'Sullivan a Cork Senior Hurling Championship medal. Na Piarsaigh failed to retain their title, while the club also faced defeat at the hands of Erin's Own in 1992. Three years later O'Sullivan lined out in a fourth championship decider as North Cork minnows Ballyhea provided the opposition. A 1‚Äì12 to 3‚Äì1 victory gave O'Sullivan a second championship medal. Minor and under-21 O'Sullivan first played for Cork as a member of the minor hurling team on 9 July 1979 when he was introduced as a substitute in Cork's 3‚Äì17 to 4‚Äì4 provincial final defeat of Limerick. It was his first Munster medal. On 2 September 1979 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. O'Sullivan scored 0‚Äì2 from right wing-forward and collected an All-Ireland medal as Cork recorded a 2‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì9 victory. This game marked the end of the most successful period for minor hurling in Cork. After making his debut with the Cork minor football team on 3 May 1980, O'Sullivan won a Munster medal in that code in 1981 following a narrow 0‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì5 defeat of Kerry. On 20 September 1981 Cork faced Derry in the All-Ireland decider. A comfortable 4‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì7 victory gave O'Sullivan an All-Ireland medal in that code. O'Sullivan's performances with the Cork minor footballers saw him added to the starting fifteen of the under-21 side for the All-Ireland final replay with Galway on 8 November 1981. That game failed to live up to the excitement of the replay, however, a 2‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì6 victory gave O'Sullivan an All-Ireland medal in the under-21 grade. As a dual under-21 player in 1982, O'Sullivan enjoyed mixed fortunes. With the hurlers he won his first Munster medal following a 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì4 provincial decider defeat of Limerick. On 12 September 1982 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. Cork came from behind in the closing stages to win by a single point scored from long range by Kevin Hennessy. The 0‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11 victory gave O'Sullivan an All-Ireland medal. He had earlier won a Munster medal with the under-21 footballers following a 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì4 trouncing of old rivals Kerry. In 1984 O'Sullivan was in his final year with the under-21 teams. He won a second Munster medal with the footballers as Limerick were accounted for by 1‚Äì18 to 0‚Äì4. On 26 August 1984 Cork faced Mayo in the All-Ireland decider. A narrow 0‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì6 victory gave O'Sullivan a second All-Ireland medal. Senior =Early defeats= O'Sullivan made his senior hurling championship debut for Cork on 30 May 1982 when he scored 0‚Äì7 in a 1‚Äì19 to 2‚Äì8 Munster quarter- final defeat of Tipperary. Cork powered their way through the provincial campaign and a massive 5‚Äì21 to 3‚Äì6 defeat of Waterford in the decider, with O'Sullivan scoring 0‚Äì12, gave him a first Munster medal. On 5 September 1982 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. \\"The Cats\\", who many viewed as the underdogs, surprised all on the day, with Christy Heffernan scoring two goals in a forty-second spell just before the interval to take the wind out of Cork's sails. Ger Fennelly got a third goal within eight minutes of the restart, giving Kilkenny a 3‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì15 victory. In spite of this defeat O'Sullivan ended his debut year by claiming a first All-Star. Illness limited O'Sullivan's involvement in Cork's 1983 championship campaign. In spite of this he won a second Munster medal after being introduced as a substitute in Cork's 3‚Äì22 to 0‚Äì12 defeat of Waterford. The All-Ireland final on 4 September 1983 was a replay of the previous year with Cork hoping to avenge the defeat by Kilkenny. O'Sullivan started the game on the bench but was introduced as a substitute. Billy Fitzpatrick was the star with ten points, giving Kilkenny a 2‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì9 lead with seventeen minutes left, however, they failed to score for the remainder of the game. A stunning comeback by Cork just fell short and they were defeated by 2‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì12. =First All-Ireland successes= Cork were the dominant force in Munster once again in 1984, with O'Sullivan winning a third successive Munster medal following a memorable 4‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì14 defeat of Tipperary in the provincial showpiece. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1984, played at Semple Stadium in Thurles, saw Cork take on Offaly for the first time ever in championship history. The centenary-year final failed to live up to expectations and Cork recorded a relatively easy 3‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12 victory. It was O'Sullivan's first All-Ireland medal. In 1985 O'Sullivan added a fourth successive Munster medal to his collection as Cork defeated Tipperary by 4‚Äì17 to 4‚Äì11 in the provincial decider once again. Cork made it five-in-a-row in Munster in 1986 as they defeated Clare by 2‚Äì18 to 3‚Äì12 to take the provincial title. It was O'Sullivan's fifth successive Munster medal. This victory paved the way for an All-Ireland final meeting with Galway on 7 September 1986. The men from the west were the red-hot favourites against a Cork team in decline, however, on the day a different story unfolded. Four Cork goals, one from John Fenton, two from Tom√°s Mulcahy and one from Kevin Hennessy, stymied the Galway attack and helped the Rebels to a 4‚Äì13 to 2‚Äì15 victory. It was O'Sullivan's second All-Ireland medal while a second All-Star quickly followed. A controversial disallowed goal by O'Sullivan denied Cork a record-breaking sixth successive Munster medal in 1987, while Cork faced defeat by Tipperary once again in the 1988 decider. In spite of this O'Sullivan won a third All-Star at the end of that season. =A third All- Ireland medal= In 1990 Cork bounced back after a period in decline. O'Sullivan won a sixth Munster medal that year following a 4‚Äì16 to 2‚Äì14 defeat of Tipperary. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 2 September 1990 pitted Cork against Galway for the second time in four years. Galway were once again the red-hot favourites and justified this tag by going seven points ahead in the opening thirty-five minutes thanks to a masterful display by Joe Cooney. Cork fought back with an equally expert display by captain Tom√°s Mulcahy. The game was effectively decided on an incident which occurred midway through the second half when Cork goalkeeper Ger Cunningham blocked a point-blank shot from Martin Naughton with his nose. The umpires gave no 65-metre free, even though he clearly deflected it out wide. Cork went on to win a high-scoring and open game of hurling by 5‚Äì15 to 2‚Äì21. It was a third All-Ireland medal for O'Sullivan. He finished off the year by winning a fourth All-Star before being named Texaco Hurler of the Year. Cork surrendered their titles in 1991, however, O'Sullivan claimed his seventh and final Munster medal in 1992 following a 1‚Äì22 to 3‚Äì11 of Limerick. On 6 September 1992 Cork faced Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. At half-time Cork were two points ahead, however, two second-half goals by John Power and Michael \\"Titch\\" Phelan supplemented a first-half D. J. Carey penalty which gave Kilkenny a 3‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì12 victory. =Decline= O'Sullivan won a National Hurling League in 1993 following a 3‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì12 defeat of Wexford. Cork's hurling fortunes took a downturn over the next few years and O'Sullivan retired from inter-county hurling following Cork's exit from the 1995 championship. Inter-provincial O'Sullivan was first chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team in 1983, however, the southern province lost out to Connacht in the semi-final. After being omitted from the team in 1984, O'Sullivan was included at left corner-forward the following year as Munster faced Connacht in the decider. A narrow 3‚Äì6 to 1‚Äì11 victory gave O'Sullivan a Railway Cup medal. Munster faced defeat over the course of the next four championships, however, the team bounced back in 1992. O'Sullivan was a non-playing substitute that year as Munster defeated Ulster by 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8.

He won a bronze medal in the 800 m at the 2006 European Athletics Championships. He is coached by Alan Hastey and is on the World Class Podium funding programme. Ellis attended Penistone Grammar School and is a graduate from Sheffield Hallam University in Architecture. National and international career Ellis was a member of Barnsley Athletics Club before joining City of Sheffield Athletic Club in 2007 and was formerly a 400m international, achieving a bronze medal at this distance in the 2000 Commonwealth Youth Games held in Edinburgh. In 2004 he was a surprise winner of the 800m at the AAA National Championships, claiming his first senior AAA gold. Despite the win at the AAAs, which were also used as the Olympic trials, Ellis was not picked for the Olympics that year as he had not achieved the qualifying standard. Two years later, in 2006, Ellis had another successful run at the AAAs, this time winning the silver medal. Earlier in the season Ellis had set a new personal best at 800m of 1:45.67 which was within the qualifying mark for the European Championships held that year. The new personal best and the silver at the AAAs secured Ellis a place at the Europeans in Gothenburg: his first time representing Great Britain at a senior major championships. At the Europeans, after initially having a poor run in the first round of the competition, only scraping through as a fastest loser in a time 1:47.72 Ellis was more impressive in his semifinal qualifying by right for the final in third place. A tactically well run race in the final and a strong finish lead him to third place and his first major senior medal. Following on from his performance at the 2006 European Championships, Ellis was picked to represent the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team in the 800m at the Norwich Union International Great Britain v U.S. v Russia v China meeting in Birmingham, held on 19 and 20 August 2006. In the race Ellis finished third for Great Britain, behind an American and a Russian runner, with a time of 1:47.98. Ellis' highest IAAF world ranking for the 800m is 44, achieved 26 March 2007. Personal bests Ellis set his 800 m personal best on 10 June 2006 at Watford.

It was the eighth novel in his long-running series of adventures featuring secret agent Matt Helm. Plot summary Matt Helm is sent to Canada where his assignment is to stop a scheme to bring a Soviet submarine within striking distance of the United States. Film adaptation plans In the 1960s, a series of popular motion pictures based upon the Matt Helm series were produced starring Dean Martin. These films only loosely adapted their source material, choosing to adopt a comedic tone, rather than the serious tone of Hamilton's books. At the end of the fourth film, 1969's The Wrecking Crew, it is announced that Matt Helm's next cinematic adventure would be The Ravagers (presumably based upon this novel). Martin, however, declined to return to the role for a fifth time and the film was never made. Sharon Tate, his co-star in the fourth film, was to have co-starred in The Ravagers (the first of Helm's female companions to make a return appearance) but was murdered by the Manson Family in August 1969. Martin had pre-approval of his co-star and was not happy with the alternatives that Columbia Pictures presented and wanted Goldie Hawn to co-star. Hawn wanted $150,000 to appear which Columbia weren't prepared to pay. An alternate account by Martin biographer Nick Tosches suggests Martin pulled out of the film due to being upset at Tate's death.Tosches, Nick Dino Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams 1999 Delta References External links *Synopsis and summary 1964 American novels Matt Helm novels Novels set in Canada ","title":"The Ravagers (novel)"},{"id":"6433191","text":"The flat-headed kusimanse (Crossarchus platycephalus) is a mongoose species endemic to West African rainforests.
