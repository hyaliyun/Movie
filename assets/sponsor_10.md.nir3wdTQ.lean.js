It is part of the Black Bass series. The player attempts to rise up from an amateur tournament to the bass fishing championship in both versions. In the North American version, the player must compete and win against Hank Parker for the championship.  Setting  The game takes place in an unknown State, in three lakes and one river. * Green Valley Lake - The location of the Local Amateur Tournament, Green Valley Lake appears to be a glacial lake, due to its general appearance and name. Green Valley Lake is fairly shallow, and as such supports a large amount and variety of plant life, including water lilies, reeds or cat tails and weed beds. * Onyx River - The location of the Amateur Bass Championship, Onyx River gets its name from thick sediment, making for very low visibility water. This, combined with flowing, moderately deep water makes for little plant growth. The river flows from SSE to N, with rock slides in a small, eroded oxbow in the northern portion of the east arm of the river. * Bronze Lake - Bronze Lake is the site of the Pro Bass Tournament. Bronze Lake was formerly a farm valley before the river was dammed, as evidenced by the underwater buildings. A man- made reservoir, the largest signs of humanity are the dam at the southern end, and a garbage dump in a cove in the north east corner. Dead trees, flooded when the river was dammed, are located near the dam, on either side of the lake. * Bluestone Lake - Chosen as the site of the Bassin' World Championship, Bluestone Lake likely gets its name from its depth, from which it receives its deep blue coloring. Its many features include dense water lilies, a road bridge running through the center of the lake, a garbage dump, and sunken weeds and cars. Reception GamePro gave the game a positive review, saying it \\"hits the water with enough competition for anglers of all ages to enjoy.\\" They praised the game's strategic decision-making and realistic graphics with changing weather. A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that after producing three SNES fishing games in as many years, Hot B \\"has it down to a pure science.\\" He cited the depth and realism of the game's fishing experience and the exceptional graphics, but nonetheless gave it only three out of five stars.

A team of 200 policemen, under orders from the Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, laid siege to kampung (village) houses in Memali, near Baling in Kedah. The houses were occupied by an Islamic sect of about 400 people led by Ibrahim Mahmud a.k.a. Ibrahim Libya. The siege resulted in the deaths of 14 villagers and 4 policemen.  Background  The Memali Incident followed severely strained relationships between UMNO and PAS, two major political parties in Malaysia. Some PAS leaders had concluded that UMNO members were apostate. In 1981, Hadi Awang, (who was then PAS state commissioner for Terengganu, and has been PAS President since 2002) claimed that UMNO perpetuated the unIslamic rule of colonialism, and therefore the struggle of PAS and its supporters against UMNO is jihad, Briefly summarizes \\"Amanat Haji Hadi\\" Contains full text of \\"Amanat Haji Hadi\\", along with an English translation and that those who died in the struggle are al-shahid (martyrs). In the wake of Hadi's claims, there was a serious rift in the Malay Muslim community. In Besut, Terengganu for example, communities were split to the extent that communal prayers were done separately for UMNO and for PAS congregations.  Ibrahim Mahmud  Ibrahim was a local religious teacher who had received part of his education at the University of Tripoli in Libya, hence his nickname Ibrahim Libya. The police wanted to arrest Ibrahim Mahmud under the Internal Security Act, for creating discord and disharmony, but he refused to give himself up. Ibrahim was also accused of harbouring two brothers, Yusof Che Mit and Ramli Che Mit, who were fugitives. Revered by the village folks, who called him Ustaz Ibrahim, they vowed to defend him to the death. Ibrahim attended Sekolah Rendah Kebangsaan Weng in Baling before furthering his studies in Islamic studies at Sekolah Agama Ittifaqiah, Kg Carok Putih, Weng and later Pondok Al-Khariah, Pokok Sena, Seberang Perai. Ibrahim Mahmud attended the University of Tripoli in Libya. He had also studied in India and at Al-Azhar University in Cairo. Upon his return, he worked as a preacher with Pusat Islam. He appeared on television to lecture on topics of Islam. Allegedly, Ibrahim was involved in the 1974 Baling Demonstrations along with Anwar Ibrahim. Ibrahim Mahmud's politics drifted towards those of PAS. His close association with PAS worried the government of Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. In 1978, Ibrahim contested the elections for the seat of Bayu-Baling as a PAS candidate. Ibrahim polled 5,081 votes as opposed to the Barisan Nasional candidate who polled 6,169 votes. In 1982, Ibrahim again contested for the same seat but lost by 100 votes. Pusat Islam looked into his teachings and thereafter banned him from lecturing in the media or to give lectures in mosques and suraus throughout the nation. Pusat Islam also started making allegations of 'deviationist acts' against him. Ibrahim was called a fanatic who challenged the integrity of the Government.  Aftermath   Death toll  The police action left 14 civilians and 4 policemen dead. The villagers were armed with a few guns, machetes, sharpened bamboo rods, and other rudimentary weapons. The police used heavy vehicles. At the height of the assault, some villagers, men and women, came out in the open in a state of frenzy and hysteria. Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, who was also Home Affairs Minister, announced to the media that 14 'criminals' had been killed in Kampung Memali in clashes with security forces. Arrests Police detained 159 people, including women and children. Thirty-six persons involved in the incident were arrested under the Internal Security Act in January 1986 but later released in June.  Government White Paper  The government published a white paper and showed an official video recording of the incident on national television. The White Paper on the incident said the extremists tried to spread deviationist teachings and disrupt public order. The Malaysian Government released video footage culled from police tapes of the operation on prime time television on TV1, the primary government television station.LAWASIA human rights bulletin, Volumes 5‚Äì10, Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific The video showed villagers armed with parangs, slingshots and Molotov cocktails taunting and protesting the actions of the Federal Reserve Unit troopers. The video also showed a mortally wounded police sergeant writhing in pain while awaiting help. In February 2002, TV1 showed the confessions of a man involved in the Memali incident. The Information Ministry's Zainuddin Maidin explained that the man would relate how he was influenced to participate. Zainuddin said the intention of the broadcast was to show the truth. PAS was concerned over plans to air the video clip as it may have implications on a pending court case involving the families of those killed in the incident. A PAS official said they were not worried about the political impact of the video clip because PAS believes the people would not blindly accept it.  Consequences  PAS called those who died as al- shahid, those who have achieved shahid (martyrs). Ibrahim Mahmud is called al- Shahid Ibrahim. This was in stark contrast to the Government's stand of calling those who dies as \\"criminals\\". Dr. M: \\"The Memali incident occurred on November 19, 1985...Four policemen were killed and 16 criminals.\\" The Kedah State Fatwa Council took the dramatic step of issuing a Fatwa saying that those who died were not al-shahid as claimed by PAS. The National Fatwa Council on 3 February 1986 also ruled that the deaths of Ibrahim Libya and his followers were not martyrdom. Al-Mau'nah founder and leader, Mohamed Amin Mohamed Razali was allegedly present during part of the Memali Incident. The incident became part of his motive for the Al-Ma'unah establishment, to overthrow the Malaysian government. Kamaruzaman Yusoff views that the \\"Memali Incident entailed the interpretation and materialisation of the concepts of jihƒÅd and syahid. A re-interpretation of these two concepts has manifested itself in the recent Al-Mau'nah Incident and the activities of the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (Malaysian Militant Group) that tried to effect political changes through unconstitutional means; and this is certainly in contrast to PAS' willingness to participate in the Malaysian electoral process.\\" At the time of the incident, media reported Dr. Mahathir Mohamad was away on a visit to China, and identified Musa as the Acting Prime Minister. That story remained unchanged until 2014, nearly 29 years later, when Musa revealed that Dr. Mahathir was in fact still in his office in Malaysia. Musa categorically denied he was the Acting Prime Minister at that time. In response, Dr. Mahathir confirmed that, contrary to past news reports, he was in Malaysia on the day of the siege. Following these revelations, PAS called for formation of a Royal Commission of Inquiry (RCI) to probe the Memali incident and to retract the white paper on the incident, but this was rejected by Parliament. As of April 2014, survivors were continuing to seek an explanation of the incident from the government.  Memali fund  A fund known as the Memali Fund was set up to collect donation for the next-of-kin of Ibrahim Libya and those who died during the Memali Incident. PAS through Harakah had urged generous donations to the fund to help the families of Ibrahim and his men which the party regarded as martyrs. A PAS member lodged a police report against alleged misappropriation. This led to a public outcry and prompted PAS president Fadzil Noor to investigate.

She served as a commissioned ship for seven years. Electra (AK-21) was launched 18 November 1941 as Meteor by Tampa Shipbuilding Co., Tampa, Fla., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. C. O. Andrews, wife of the Senator from Florida; transferred to the Navy 16 April 1941; and commissioned 17 March 1942, Commander J. J. Hughes in command. She was reclassified AKA-4, 1 February 1943. Service history World War II After a fast voyage from Norfolk, Va., to Wellington, New Zealand, between 10 May and 18 July 1942, to deliver men of the 1st Marines, Electra, upon her return trained in the Chesapeake Bay with troops assigned to the initial north African landings. On 23 October she sailed for French Morocco and saw action during the invasion landings off Safi on 8 November. Although several of her landing boats were lost under intensive fire from the beach, she unloaded her cargo by the 14th and got underway with wounded soldiers on board. Bound for Fedhala, she was torpedoed on the starboard side by German U-boat U-173 . took off all of Electra's crew and passengers except for a ship's salvage party, and with the assistance of several ships, Electra was beached at Casablanca two days later. Her remaining cargo was discharged, and her ship's company with the aid of salvage facilities ashore performed a herculean repair job which enabled her to return to Charleston 30 April 1943. Following an overhaul and permanent repairs, Electra carried out amphibious training in Chesapeake Bay until the end of the year, then sailed from Norfolk on 11 December 1943 for the Pacific. She departed Pearl Harbor 23 January 1944 for the invasion of the Marshalls, and during the capture of Kwajalein furnished her boats for the occupation of the small islands north of the atoll, and refueled minecraft and small craft of the invasion force. After discharging part of her cargo, she sailed to Eniwetok where she supplied boats and equipment for the initial landings 18 February. After unloading the remainder of her cargo, Electra returned to Pearl Harbor 8 March. In June 1944, Electra served in the assault landings on Saipan, debarking her troops 15 June and unloading cargo and embarking casualties for return to Pearl Harbor until 26 June. She arrived at Guadalcanal in August to stage for the invasion of the Palaus, and on 15 September took part in the feint assault on Babelthuap to divert attention from the main landings on Peleliu. Two days later she was engaged as control boat for the initial assault on Angaur, remaining there to unload cargo until the 23d. After a brief respite at Manus, Electra sortied for the invasion of the Philippines, landing her troops and cargo at Tacloban, Leyte, 20 October 1944, sailing 2 days later for the Palaus. She lifted troops from Guam for support landings on 23 November, then sailed to Hollandia, New Guinea, to prepare for the next invasion. On 9 January 1945, Electra arrived at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon for the initial assault, made under air attack, and successfully offloaded her troops and cargo by the 17th. She returned to New Guinea briefly to embark Army troops for transfer to support operations at Mindoro, then sailed to Ulithi, arriving 19 February. On 18 March 1945, Electra arrived off Iwo Jima to embark men of the fighting 5th Marines for transportation to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 April. The transport then continued on to the West Coast of the United States for overhaul. When the war ended, Electra was back at Pearl Harbor. She carried occupation troops to Wakayama and Hiro Wan from Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, then embarked returning veterans for the States, arriving at San Francisco 10 November 1945. She was placed out of commission in reserve 19 March 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission 1 July 1946. Korea Reacquired from the Maritime Commission 16 October 1951 as a result of the Korean War, Electra was recommissioned 3 May 1952. She operated along the West Coast of the United States, taking part in amphibious exercises and acting as a submarine target vessel. In June 1953 she loaded cargo at Long Beach for a supply mission in the Arctic, then sailed from Seattle 10 July with TF 9 to arrive at Icy Cape on the 21st. Electra furnished provisions, fuel, and water to other ships in the force, as well as unloading cargo for northern bases. She returned to San Diego 2 September, and except for a supply mission to the Pribilof Islands from 10 July to 7 September 1954, Electra continued training and upkeep along the west coast until placed out of commission in reserve again 13 May 1955.

Campers take turns driving a breakdown-prone bus to gather ICKY animalsNOTE: ICKY animals are similar in size and composition to Mattel's 1965 Creepy Crawlers activity toy from various summer camp locations to be the first to leave the real rotten camp NOTE: The TV commercial describes the following: > (singing)Hello Muddah -- la la la > Hello Fadduh -- la la la > Here's a game called -- la la la > Camp Granada -- la la la > All us children -- la la la > love it madly -- la la la > Manufactured by my uncle Milton Bradley -- la la la > > (conversation) It's a real good game, too > It's all about this uh, real rotten camp, Camp Granada > and the object of the game is to get home from camp, anyway you can -- try > to escape > > And you get this uh rotten board > and all these rotten cards > and everybody gets a rotten bunkhouse > and then there's this rotten camp bus > and it can bus, uh you go, see, > the motor falls out right in the middle > and you get these icky, icky animals -- they're disgusting, yech > that's a frog > and here's a (ooh ooh ooh) a crazy lizard or something like that > > (singing) Hello Muddah -- la la la > Hello Fadduh -- la la la > Get this game called -- la la la > Camp Granada -- la la la > It's a game that -- la la la > should be gotten -- la la la > Milten Bradley's game about a camp that's rotten -- blah for home. The game board depicts spikes on the diving board, an octopus in the swimming hole, and a lover's leap into a volcano. Gameplay Camp Granada Bus cards have an image of a blue bus in disrepairNOTE: The image on the Camp Granada Bus card is similar to the box image, with a smoking tailpipe, a steam-spewing radiator, a broken window, a patched roof, and loose parts flying. and, on the reverse, a humorous reason to either drive the bus to a camp location and pick up an ICKY animalNOTE: Instructions in addition to \\"GO TO...\\" on the Camp Granada Bus cards do not have to be completed, e.g., the \\"and wash the floor\\" text on the HOSPITAL card is only for humor. :NOTE: The reference to \\"x-ray machine\\" on a HOSPITAL card is similar to the use of X-Ray Specs, a 1960s novelty. or to receive a SPECIAL PRIVILEGE and \\"take one ICKY animal from any player\\". After drawing a Camp Granada Bus card, the player then moves the toy bus along the road to the camp location specified by the card. The challenge is that the front axle of the bus can slide side-to-side and \\"the motor falls out right in the middle\\". In particular, if the front wheels move too far from the side of the bus, a small cam on the middle of the axle will contact one of two miniature lever arms connected to the bus's radiator, which is hinged and will be deflected to fall forward ‚Äî the \\"breakdown\\" that ends a player's turn. For success, a player must carefully watch that neither front wheel moves too far beyond the corresponding bus fender.NOTE: A comparable action/dexterity children's game to Camp Granada is the 1965 Milton Bradley Operation (game), which requires players to carefully remove objects (e.g., \\"wrenched ankle\\") from the patient depicted on the board without contacting the sides of holes containing the objects. A tactic to negotiate turns without a breakdown is to steer by carefully sliding the rear of the bus. An alternate tactic is to 'cut the corner' to more easily negotiate sharp turns, but a rule requires at least one wheel be on the road (at some points, the road is narrower than the track width of the wheels). Players also learn to watch other players who drive the bus with their fingers close to the front wheels and to ensure such players don't touch a front wheel to prevent the axle from sliding. For the SPECIAL PRIVILEGE to \\"take one ICKY animal\\", a rule requires reaching into a competitor's bunkhouse without looking, so a game skill is to remember which competitor had acquired particular ICKY animals, and then by touch, recognize the shape of the needed ICKY animal. The player who first acquires the required three ICKY animals and exits the camp is the winner. Equipment and setup Equipment includes the 23‚Öùx 19¬Ω\\" tri-fold game board, a plastic toy bus, 4 cardboard bunkhouses, 12 rubber ICKY animals (2 each Crawfish, Frog, Lizard, Mouse, Snake, Spider), 16 ICKY animal cards (2 for each of the 6 animals, plus 4 for the Boating, Bunkhouse, Handicrafts, and Hiking Awards), and 48 of the 2‚Öùx1¬æ\\" Camp Granada Bus Cards (6 SPECIAL PRIVILEGE, plus 3 for each of 12 of the locations and only 2 for First Aid Training, Bunk House, & Hospital) Setup requires ICKY animals be placed at camp locations and the bunkhouses be assembled and placed at each corner of the game board for players to subsequently conceal ICKY animals. ICKY animal cards are then divided among the players to identify which ICKY animals need to be gathered.

S. city of Sauk Rapids, Minnesota. Construction began on September 26, 2005; the bridge was completed in September 2007 and opened to traffic on October 23, 2007. The official dedication and ribbon-cutting ceremony took place on November 16, 2007. The bridge replaced the former Sauk Rapids Bridge, located a short distance downriver, which was demolished in the fall and winter of 2007-2008. The new bridge spans the BNSF Railway on the east bank of the river. Traffic flow is no longer disrupted during train crossings; this was a frequent problem with the former bridge. The new span relied heavily on steel for its construction rather than concrete to reduce the number of piers needed to be placed in the river. This design choice increased the project cost by $2.3 million USD to a total cost estimated at $56.63 million. Construction of the bridge of itself cost an estimated $20.46 million, with other costs including right-of-way purchases, road construction, and a program to help businesses affected by the project relocate elsewhere in downtown Sauk Rapids. The entire project was large in scope, due to the amount of business and residential properties that were affected by its chosen location. When the Sauk Rapids Bridge project began, it was considered to be the first downtown transportation project of its kind nationwide in terms of the scale of relocations of businesses that were necessary. The success of the project may set a precedent for future bridges. The original design of the bridge was hotly contested between Benton County and the City of Sauk Rapids, and the dispute was nearly taken to court. The county had wished that the bridge land beyond Benton Drive (Sauk Rapids' \\"main street\\") on Second Avenue and connect with Second Street North. The city feared that such a design would adversely affect businesses in the downtown area and desired instead that the bridge land on Benton Drive. Benton County's stake in the project (Stearns County being the other contributor) was eventually handed over to the city, and it was elected that the bridge pass over the BNSF Railway, land on Benton Drive, and connect with Second Street North. The Sauk Rapids Regional Bridge features a spiral walkway on the Sauk Rapids side of the bridge that allows pedestrians to access the city parking lot under the bridge.

He lives in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. The son of Douglas Austin Reed and his wife Mary Ellen Philpott, he was educated at Gresham's School in Norfolk and University College, Oxford. Reed served his National Service with the Royal Navy from 1956 to 1958, and from 1963 to 1966 worked and studied the EEC at Brussels, Bruges, Leiden, Luxembourg, Strasbourg, Paris, Rome, Bologna and Geneva. He worked at the Public Sector Research Unit from 1967 to 1970, and was elected as Member of Parliament for Bolton East in 1970, serving until 1974. In September, 1971, in a telegram to the prime minister of the day, Edward Heath, Reed proposed the forcible repatriation of citizens of the Republic of Ireland living in the UK as a means of persuading the Irish premier, Jack Lynch, to act against terrorists. Part of his telegram read: \\"Bolton and Lancashire would take a poor view of any show of weakness over the continuing use of the Republic as a base for the IRA gunmen.\\" Laurance Reed joined the Royal Navy for his National Service and as a young naval officer he took part in Operation Grapple, Britain's first series of thermonuclear tests held in the Central Pacific in 1957. His ship was 26 miles from ground zero. He wore a hood, dark goggles and protective clothing but still saw the flash and felt the heat on his back and shoulders. Looking back he always used to say that the test were fascinating to observe but that it was terrifying to think what such weapons could do to a city and its inhabitants. In 1960 he went up to University College Oxford to read Law. During his time as an undergraduate he joined the editorial staff of the magazine 'Isis', campaigned for the abolition of capital punishment and held office in the Oxford University Conservative Association. He also became the Treasurer of the Oxford Union debating society but resigned from that position in protest when the Oxford Union refused to accept women as full members. Immediately after graduating, Laurance went to Europe for two years to study the workings and the institutions of the EEC, or the Common Market as it was called. He visited each of the six member states but spent most of his time in Brussels and Strasbourg. He met politicians, diplomats, civil servants, businessmen, economists, lawyers and academics. They were all keen that Britain should join. On his return home he wrote a book on the subject, 'Europe in a Shrinking World', which put the economic and political case for British membership. It was only in 1969 that the green light was given to negotiations for British membership. The United Kingdom joined the European Economic Community (as it then was) on 1 January 1973 with Denmark and Ireland. This was the first of a number of books Laurance Reed researched and wrote over the years. One of them was about marine pollution which was written when he was a director of the Association Europ√©enne Oc√©anique (Eurocean), an organisation founded to promote European cooperation in the exploration of the deep sea. Another book told the history of Soay, an island just off Skye in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, where he owned a house and lived for fourteen years. Laurance Reed was elected MP for Bolton East in June 1970, winning the seat from Labour. The following year he became Secretary of the Conservative Backbench Committee on the Environment and persuaded the Government to finance an environmental improvement scheme in Britain's old industrial cities. On Britain's accession to the EEC he was made the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister for Europe. He lost his seat in the election of February 1974 when Ted Heath's Government was defeated by Harold Wilson. He wrote a brief account of his time in Parliament. Among interesting people Laurance Reed met and got to know in the course of his life were: John Inman, also known as Mr Humphries, with whom he worked in the display department at Austin Reed of Regent Street; Jacques Cousteau, the French underwater explorer who was the driving force behind Eurocean; and Fred Dibnah, the steeplejack and engineer who lived in Bolton East, his former UK Parliament constituency.

Jolicoeur, Vincent Mason and Kelvin Mercer were friends who attended the same high school in the Amityville area of Long Island during the 1980s. After they decided to form a rap group, each member re-christened themselves with an outlandish name (Trugoy the Dove, P.A. Pasemaster Mase and Posdnuos, respectively). Early on, Jolicoeur sported a unique style of African medallions, peace signs and uneven dreadlocks (known as the \\"De La Do\\"). Paired with the positive messages of the group's debut effort, 3 Feet High and Rising, the image led to critics and journalists labelling the members as \\"the hippies of hip hop\\" (a title that the group was quick to refute with the release of the second album De La Soul Is Dead in 1991). Jolicoeur is also a member of the Spitkicker collective. Jolicoeur is most known and recognized for his rap in the second verse of the popular Gorillaz song Feel Good Inc.. Biography Jolicoeur is American of Haitian descent. Aliases All three members of De La Soul have a variety of known aliases and nicknames used throughout the group's career. The following are the most significant: * Trugoy ‚Äì The word \\"Trugoy\\" is backwards for \\"yogurt\\", because he likes yogurt. Jolicoeur once said in a video that, \\"I enjoyed eating yogurt. I mean, I eat it a lot.\\" Also Trugoy The Dove. * Plug Two ‚Äì An early concept for 3 Feet High and Rising involved music being transmitted from Mars by three microphone plugs (each one representing a member of the group). Though this idea was abandoned, the titles \\"Plug One\\", \\"Plug Two\\" and \\"Plug Three\\" still became relevant on the album. * Dove - The full \\"Trugoy the Dove\\" name is shortened to just \\"Dove\\" and sometimes expanded to \\"Dove Love\\". * Dave - Some liner notes list him as simply the short version of his given name David. * JD Dove - First used by Posdnous in the song \\"Stakes is High\\" References 1971 births American dance musicians American male musicians Record producers from New York (state) American rappers of Haitian descent Grammy Award winners Living people Rappers from New York (state) Rappers from Brooklyn Alternative hip hop musicians De La Soul members 21st-century American rappers 21st-century American male musicians ","title":"David Jude Jolicoeur"},{"id":"6445678","text":"Istana Pasir Pelangi is a royal palace of the Tunku Mahkota (Crown prince) of Johor.

They are owned by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and are operated by the Nazarat Taleem Sadr Anjuman Ahmadiyya Pakistan (ŸÜÿ∏ÿßÿ±ÿ™ ÿ™ÿπŸÑ€åŸÖ ÿµÿØÿ± ÿßŸÜÿ¨ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ€å€Å Ÿæÿß⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ). These schools were established under and named after the Nusrat Jahan Scheme; a scheme launched by the community for the educational betterment of its members. These institutions offer programmes of primary, secondary, higher secondary and undergraduate and postgraduate education. Majority of the students enrolled in these schools are Ahmadi Muslims, mostly the residents of Rabwah though these institutions are not exclusively for Ahmadi Muslims and also enroll non-Ahmadi students from Rabwah and its surrounding areas. History The first educational institution to be established under the Nusrat Jahan Scheme was named Nusrat Jahan Academy. It was founded in the year 1987 at Darul Rehmat East, adjacent to the Aqsa Mosque. The Nusrat Jahan Academy had one campus partitioned into two sections; one for boys and the other for girls. The medium of instruction at Nusrat Jahan Academy was Urdu in the four years after its inception. In 1991, English medium of instruction was introduced at the Nusrat Jahan Academy. For this purpose, both sections of the school were further divided into Urdu and English medium sections. Higher secondary education was later introduced in the section for boys and hence the name of the school was changed to Nusrat Jahan Academy and Inter College. In 2005, a new campus called Nusrat Jahan Academy Urdu Medium Boys was established at Darul Nasr West, to provide secondary education exclusively to boys. The medium of instruction at this school was Urdu. The Urdu medium sections at the Darul Rehmat East campus were then abolished. In September 2011, Nusrat Jahan College was established to provide higher secondary and higher education to young men and women. For the next two years it provided higher education exclusively to women; until September 2014. Classes for the undergraduate programmes were taught in evening in the Nusrat Jahan Academy Girls School campus. In August 2013, a separate building for the Nusrat Jahan Girls College was put into operation. In September 2014, following certain changes in the national educational policy of the Government of Pakistan, Nusrat Jahan Academy Urdu medium boys was abolished which gave way to Nusrat Jahan Boys College. It was established at the Darul Nasr West campus.  Nusrat Jahan Academy  Nusrat Jahan Academy (NJA) was established in 1987. It has separate campuses for boys and girls. It has an estimated worth of 7 million Pakistani Rupees. Nusrat Jahan Academy Boys School Nusrat Jehan Academy Boys School is an all boys high school. It provides secondary education to boys. The medium of instruction at Nusrat Jehan Academy Boys School is English. It is located in Darul Rehmat East; adjacent to the Aqsa Mosque. It was established in the year 1991 but became a separate English medium school in 2005. Currently 702 students are enrolled in the Nusrat Jehan Academy Boys School. Nusrat Jahan Academy Girls School Nusrat Jahan Academy Girls School provides primary and secondary education to girls and primary education to boys. It is located adjacent to the Nusrat Jahan Academy Boys school in Darul Rehmat East. It was established in the year 1991. Nusrat Jehan Academy Girls School has 1,500 students enrolled, at present. Nusrat Jahan College Nusrat Jahan Academy Boys High School Nusrat Jahan College Nusrat Jahan College (NJC) was established in September 2011. It has separate campuses for boys and girls. Nusrat Jahan Boys College Nusrat Jehan Boys College (NJBC) is an all boys college located in Darul Nasr West, Rabwah. It provides higher secondary education to boys. It also offers a number of undergraduate programmes. For this purpose it is affiliated with University of the Punjab. Efforts to affiliate NJBC with University of the Sargodha are underway. Nusrat Jahan Girls College Nusrat Jahan Girls College is located in Central Darul Rehmat. It is dedicated to providing higher secondary and higher education to girls and young women. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, for which it is affiliated with the University of the Punjab and University of Sargodha. It has 1495 students.  Affiliation with Aga Khan University Examination Board  Nusrat Jahan Academy Boys School and Nusrat Jahan Academy Girls School were affiliated with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Faisalabad since their inception, up until the year 2011. Students of classes nine, ten, eleven and twelve would write an annual examination conducted by the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Faisalabad. Whereas students of classes five and eight would write an annual, external examination conducted by the Punjab Education Commission (PEC).In February 2011, the PEC issued admit cards for the students writing these exams but the admit card of every student of these two schools said 'non-Muslim' as opposed to 'Ahmadi' as their religion. This blatant violation of the terms of their contract impelled the Sadr Anjuman Ahmadiyya Pakistan (ÿµÿØÿ± ÿßŸÜÿ¨ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ€å€Å Ÿæÿß⁄©ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜ)‚Äî the central governing council of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community‚Äî to terminate all affiliations between all Nusrat Jahan Schools and BISE, Faisalabad and PEC. These schools were then affiliated with the Aga Khan University Examination Board (AKU-EB) in March and April 2011. Aga Khan University Examination Board is a private examination board founded by the Aga Khan University in Karachi. AKU-EB has no history of religious intolerance or sectarian persecution. Students of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC) write the AKU-EB examinations in April and May every year. Supplementary and improvement examinations are held in the month of September every year. Major Events * ÿ¨ŸÑÿ≥€Å ÿ≥€åÿ±ÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ®€å All teachers and most students at Nusrat Jahan Schools are Ahmadi Muslims and as dictated by their religious beliefs ÿ≥€åÿ±ÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ®€å programmes are held on Rabbee ul avval 12, every year. * Exhibitions Exhibitions including book exhibitions are held from time to time in Nusrat Jahan Academy Boys School and Nusrat Jahan Academy Girls School.

For comparison, the catastrophic Spanish flu Pandemic of 1918-19 took an estimated 2.5%‚Äì5% mortality worldwide; about 28% of the U.S. population contracted the Spanish flu.(1) Boyd (2) Billings Like many Northwest Coast natives, the D _kh_ w'Duw'Absh and Xacuab≈° relied heavily on fishing for their well-being and their livelihood: the Pacific Northwest fisheries were once one of the richest in the world, second only to the Grand Banks. Remnants of D _kh_ w'Duw'Absh fishing gear were found near the abundant tide pools of sbuh-KWAH-buks (\\"shaped like a bear's head\\", the West Seattle peninsula). The site is in what is now called Me-Kwa-Mooks Park, where dense trees provide habitat for many birds including screech owls.(1) Tate (8 July 2001, Essay 3428) (2) Me-Kwa-Mooks Park is about 1 mi.

The fragment of forest in Schmitz Park (1908‚Äì1912) is a living reminder of what much of Seattle looked like before the City of Seattle.Tate (8 July 2001, Essay 3428) From the 1800s the Maritime Fur Trade opened access to European goods for rival northern tribes from Vancouver Island and the Georgia Strait). Having guns prompted their more effective raiding south, deep into recently named Puget Sound, in turn prompting social and organizational change. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) established Fort Langley (1827), then Fort Nisqually (1833) near present-day Dupont, within easy range and prompting keen interest in trade. As a young man, Si'a _hl_ (later called Chief Seattle) made himself both well-known and notorious around Fort Nisqually. Catholic missionaries began arriving in 1839, settlers in earnest from 1845. In 19th century maneuvering with European Great Powers, the United States assumed regional sovereignty in 1846.(1) Harmon in Hoxie (1996), pp. 522-3 (2) Miller in Hoxie (1996), p. 575 White settlements at sbuh-KWAH-buks (Alki) and what is now Pioneer Square in Downtown Seattle were established in 1851 and 1852. The latter settlement was right upon and between prominent villages on Elliott Bay and villages on the Duwamish River estuary.(1) Map key 32, Dailey footnotes 2, 5, 9, 10; map key 33, Dailey footnotes 2, 9, 10. (1.1) Dailey (2006-06-14) (2) See also Seattle before the city #Downtown and lower Duwamish River.  1855-1920s  By the time Coast Salish began to realize the implications of the changes brought by Europeans at ever-increasing rates, the time was late. After just five years, lands were occupied; the harsh Treaty of Point Elliott was signed in 1855. There is question about the legitimacy of the treaty, from the lack of understanding of whether the Natives signing the treaty were legitimate representatives of their peoples and whether the written treaty accurately matched what they were told they were signing. Squalli-Absch (\\"People of the Grass Country\\", Nisqually) si'ab Lescay (Chief Leschi, 1808-1858) urged and led resistance, with Yakama Chief Kamiakim. Si'ahl warned his white friend and sub-Indian Agent 'Doc' Maynard, possibly saving some 30 white people in early Seattle by sending a messenger to warn of a raid by Lescay and Kamiakim's war party (1856).Hilbert, p. 261 Note that Native Americans warred for complicated conceptions of prestige and for resources, and did not comprehend the European war for conquest or annihilation.Holm, p.666-668 The blockhouse was sturdy timber with breastworks and ravines, defended by 57 armed volunteers‚Äîat least six Marines‚Äîand overshadowed by the 150 man, 566 ton, 16 gun sloop-of-war Decatur and the bark Bronte, anchored and cannon zeroed (bearing and range laid in) at close range out on Elliott Bay. The Battle of Seattle (1856) ended more a skirmish, somewhat more farce than tragedy.(1) Speidel (1978) (2) Whites asserted that the Point Elliott Treaty required the DwamishThe names change. The D _kh_ w'Duw'Absh and Xacuab≈° people were \\"Dwamish\\" in the treaty; they became the Duwamish tribe of today. who were living in what became metropolitan Seattle to move onto reservations established for other tribes, most of whom (with the exception of the D _kh_ w'Suqw'Absh [Suquamish from c. 1855]) were long-time competitors if not rivals. The Duwamish tribe maintains that the terms of the treaty require a Duwamish reservation-- explicitly blocked at local behest in 1866, in contravention of the superseding and precedent treaty. Some followed si'ab Si'ahl to the Suquamish reservation at Port Madison. Others moved to the Tulalip or Muckleshoot reservations. Many refused to move, or shuttled back and forth between reservations.(1) Tate (8 July 2001, Essay 3428) (2.1) L _a_ kw' _a_ l _a_ s (Speer) (2.2) Castro & Barber Among losses due to introduced diseases, a smallpox epidemic broke out among the Northwest tribes in 1862 and killed roughly half the affected native populations. Documentation in archives and historical epidemiology demonstrates that governmental policies furthered the progress of this epidemic among the natives, and did little or nothing about the waves of other introduced epidemics. Mean population decline 1774-1874 was about 66%.(1) Lange (2003-02-04, Essay 5171) (2) Boyd (1999) (2.1) A smallpox vaccine was discovered in 1801. Russian Orthodox missionaries were a remarkable exception to general policy, vaccinating significant at-risk Native populations in what is now SE Alaska and NW British Columbia. [Boyd] The name \\"Seattle\\" for the city (c. 1853)Speidel (1978) is an Anglicization of si'√°b Si'a _hl_ , the Duwamish and Suquamish chief (si'√°b, high status man).L _a_ kw' _a_ l _a_ s (Speer) The name for the city is attributed to 'Doc' Maynard, a complex figure, who named the city after Chief Seattle, an enigmatic one.Morgan (1951, 1982), Maynard pp. 11-57; Si'a _hl_ , pp. 41, 54 True names and images of people contain a measure of the sacred for many indigenous peoples, particularly for Coast Salish (in contrast to social names, true names are only revealed intimately). Social names are considered sacred personal property, exclusive to the particular family. Consequently, Si'ahl, the Duwamish, and Suquamish were initially not pleased with the naming of the city. Eventually an accommodation was developed, with Si'ahl being accorded due honor in both Native and White cultures, and Seattle, the city, incurred another social obligation to the Duwamish people.(1) Bates, Hess, & Hilbert p. 379 (2) L _a_ kw' _a_ l _a_ s The trustees of the first incorporation of Seattle (January 1865) later passed an ordinance calling for the removal of Indians and providing for the punishment of those who might harbor them.Lange & Tate A Duwamish reservation was blocked in 1866. The commitments made by the United States government in the Treaty of Point Elliott have not yet been met.(1) L _a_ kw' _a_ l _a_ s (2) Wilma (24 January 2001, Essay 2955) Seaettle waterfront with moored Indian canoes, Seattle, c. 1892 Seattle waterfront at Washington Street c. 1890-1892, with Indian canoes moored at the boat launch. A steam launch and two small sailboats are seen, as well as a crowd on the pier. With the regional diaspora of the Treaty, some Duwamish retreated to the West Seattle peninsula, where they carried on‚Äîat least for a while‚Äîtheir traditional ways of life. What was apparently their last enclave in West Seattle was destroyed by arson in 1893 when a white man identified only as \\"Watson\\" set fire to eight makeshift homes on the banks of what is today the East Waterway. Nearly all other remaining longhouses were destroyed by non- native arson by 1910. The demographic shift had become exponential after 1880.Harmon in Hoxie (1996), pp. 522-3 In the 1900s, Native families came by canoe to the Seattle waterfront, where they camped on their way to work in the hops fields upriver. They were allowed to stay on Ballast Island, a bleak strip of land just offshore at what is now Alaskan Way, created by the ballast dumped from ships that took on cargoes of lumber or grain. Canvas tents were adopted in place of their native cattail mat shelters for traveling. Poverty was severe.Wilse Hops agriculture along the river valleys blossomed in the 1880s. Native men continued working in the lumber mills and in fishing; women sold shellfish, basketry, and made other adaptations.(1) Speidel (1978) Many longtime residents of West Seattle tell stories about finding middens full of clam scrapers, arrowheads, and other artifacts in the 1920s and 1930s‚Äîarcheological sites were not protected until 1906, and then only on public land.

The series follows the adventures and missions of a special \\"Rescue Police\\" team known as Special Police Winspector, as they stop crimes and respond to dangerous events where regular police force is not sufficient. The team is made up of one human (a hero clad in armor) and two robotic assistants. The opening catchphrase of the series is . Story Special Rescue Police Winspector takes place in a near- future Japan of the year 1999. As the country is facing a great threat from criminals, new methods of protecting people are created. The Winspector squad, consisting of the robot brothers Walter and Bikel, along with Ryouma (wearing the Fire Tector armor), defend against super powered threats, ranging from mob attacks to scientific experiments gone terribly wrong. Team *: 23 years old. Ryoma is the leader of the team and the only human member. Like Masaki, he is also a Police Superintendent. Kagawa is an orphan skilled in martial arts and knows five languages. His primary means of transportation is a purpose-built car named Winsquad. When initiating his transformation to Fire he calls out . He is then equipped with an energy sword - his primary all- purpose weapon - and a suit of red armor named the , which enhances his strength and can protect its wearer from poisonous gas, heavy gunfire, and oxygen deprivation, but can only be worn for five minutes at a time due to the stress it puts on his body. There are also other, more specialized weapons and tools available. Ryoma has a sister. He later joined the Solbrain team as Knight Fire. *: Walter's \\"twin brother\\", Bikel is one of two robots who assist Ryouma. His primary means of transportation is his motorcycle. However he also has a wheel integrated into his chest section which he can use to \\"land-surf\\" when no vehicle is available. His weaponry consists of twin lances, which can be combined into a longer staff and can alternatively function as the handles of his motorcycle or coin bombs. Bikel's armor is yellow. Being a master of jokes and sometimes a little inane, he's often subject to Walter's anger. He speaks in a Nagoya dialect. *: Bikel's \\"twin brother\\", Walter is the other of the two robots in the team. Being equipped with wings enables him to fly, thus requiring no special vehicle. His armor is turquoise. Walter loves children and he is generally the type of \\"person\\" who enjoys life. *: Shunsuke is Winspector's commander and founder. He usually remains in the headquarters of Winspector, but if necessary, for example when a member falls into a pinch, he goes to the site himself and takes command. After the series, he established another rescue team called Solbrain and made a comeback in the last few episodes of Exceedraft. *: Junko is an information G-man. She is an expert with handguns. *: Hisako is a secret G-man. She usually works in a coffee shop. Her father, , was a colleague of Masaki until he was killed in action six years ago. *: Shin'ichi is Winspector's mechanic. He develops rescue tools and maintains Bikel and Walter. Likes playing chess *: Madocks is Winspector's supercomputer. Madocks holds data on every criminal and can analyze it in an instant. *: Demitasse is a small robot. His main work is to repair Bikel and Walter during emergencies, as well as secret investigation activity. Arsenal *: strongest weapon of the team, first used in episode 31 to defeat a robot cop named Brian, who was created by the same system as Biker and Walter, but was reprogrammed to be a killing machine. GigaStreamer has two modes depending on which of two tops (drill or plasma minigun) is put onto it. Its strongest attack is a plasma minigun blast called Maxime Mode which needs Fire to insert his MaxCalibur to the gun. Later Daiki (SolBraver) used it to defeat a chameleon-robot. *: a sword-like gauntlet weapon belonging to Fire, it also shoots lasers. *: Bikel's two sticks, which can be combined to form a long rod and are used as the handlebars of WinChaser. *: Walter's wings, which can transform into a shield.

Scottish texts are often called Bonnie Annie or The Green Banks of Yarrow, English texts are most often called The Banks of Green Willow. Other titles include The Undutiful Daughter, The High Banks O Yarrow, The Watery Grave, Green Willow, There Was a Rich Merchant that Lived in Strathdinah and The Merchant's Daughter.Francis James Child, English and Scottish Popular Ballads, \\"Bonnie Annie\\"Roud Folk Song Index, Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website http://vwml.org/search?ts=1486337459743&collectionfilter;=RoudFS;RoudBS&advqtext;=0rn172# Retrieved 2017/03/09 The ballad has been collected from traditional singers in Britain, Ireland, and the USA. Synopsis A young woman, either a lord's or a merchant's daughter, in some versions called Annie but often nameless, is seduced by a man who is sometimes a sea captain or a squire, or his occupation isn't mentioned. She falls pregnant. He suggests she steals \\"some of your father's goodwill and some of your mother's money\\".Palmer R, (ed); Bushes and Briars, Folk Songs collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams; Llanerch, 1999 In other versions she steals gold from her father. They go aboard a ship. On the voyage she needs \\"women's help\\", presumably to help deliver her child, but this is not available. In some variants the ship will not sail, and either the lot falls on Annie or she asks to be thrown overboard \\"both me and my baby\\", in others her lover volunteers to throw her and the baby overboard for no apparent reason. He watches her swim, in some versions until she reaches the banks of green willow. He orders her to be buried, either in a coffin made of gold, or in a coffin with golden nails. \\"Oh make my love a coffin, Of the gold that shines yellow, And she shall be buried By the banks of green willow.\\"Vaughan Williams, R and LLoyd, A L, Penguin Book of English Folk Songs, Harmondsworth, 1959. (Collected from Mrs Overd, Langport, Somerset by Cecil Sharp in 1904.) Motifs The motif of the lots and throwing a person from the ship may be derived from the tale of Jonah. Another ballad featuring these motifs is \\"Brown Robyn's Confession\\", (Child 57, Roud 3882).Francis James Child, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, v 1, p 245, Dover Publications, New York 1965 Early versions Broadsides and early printed versions Child published two versions, both from Scottish sources. The song doesn't seem to have been printed by broadside publishers. Versions collected from traditional singers The Banks of Green Willow variant was popular with traditional singers across the south of England, where 33 versions were collected in the early twentieth century (14 in Somerset, 8 in Devon). One version was collected in Gloucestershire and another from the Shropshire singer Fred Jordan. 11 versions under various titles were collected in Scotland, one in Ireland and two in the US, both in Maine. Cecil Sharp reported the song as \\"very generally sung throughout Somerset\\".Vaughan Williams, R., and Lloyd, A.

Discussion George Ritchie Kinloch, Child's source for one of his versions, states in his notes to \\"Bonnie Annie\\" that \\"There is a prevalent belief among sea-faring people, that, if a person who has committed any heinous crime be on ship-board, the vessel, as if conscious of its guilty burden, becomes unmanageable, and will not sail till the offender is removed: to discover whom, they usually resort to the trial of those on board, by casting lots; and the individual upon whom the lot falls is declared the criminal, it being believed that Divine Providence interposes in this manner to point out the guilty person.\\"Kinloch, G R; Ancient Scottish Ballads; London; 1827 Adaptations Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould adapted the tale as The Undutiful Daughter in Old English Fairy Tales: a vain and haughty princess consults with a \\"gypsy\\" or witch character, who prophecizes she will marry a king, be carried in carriage driven by thousand white-maned horses, be attended by servants in blue, sleep in a golden bed beneath \\"a curtain of living green\\".

After the demise of The Misunderstood, Juicy Lucy was formed by steel guitarist Glenn Ross Campbell, and prolific Blackburn saxophonist Chris Mercer. The group later recruited vocalist Ray Owen, guitarist Neil Hubbard, bassist Keith Ellis, and drummer Pete Dobson. The band name was inspired by a character in The Virgin Soldiers (1966) by Leslie Thomas. Career The band immediately notched a UK Top 20 hit with their cover version of the Bo Diddley composition \\"Who Do You Love?\\" Their eponymous debut album then fell just shy of the Top 40 in the UK Albums Chart. The album's cover featured a burlesque dancer named Zelda Plum, naked except for a covering of fruit. Line-up changes ensued, as former Zoot Money singer Paul Williams (born Paul William Yarlett, 1940), guitarist Micky Moody, and drummer Rod Coombes replaced Ray Owen (who joined Killing Floor, before embarking on a solo career), Neil Hubbard and Pete Dobson, prior to the recording of 1970's Lie Back and Enjoy It (#53 ‚Äì UK Albums Chart). In May 1970, the band appeared at the annual NME poll-winners concert. Another bassist, Jim Leverton, assumed Ellis' duties for the follow- up, 1971's Get a Whiff a This. In August 1971, Juicy Lucy appeared on the bill at the Weeley Festival near Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. The constant turnover took its toll on the group both creatively and commercially, with co-founders Campbell and Mercer, plus Coombes exiting prior to the fourth Juicy Lucy album, 1972's Pieces. This was recorded by a makeshift line-up of Williams, Moody, keyboardist Jean Roussel, and the former Blodwyn Pig rhythm section of bassist Andy Pyle and drummer Ron Berg. Juicy Lucy disbanded shortly thereafter. Micky Moody was a member of Snafu between 1973 and 1976, and he later joined the inaugural Whitesnake line-up in 1978. A 1996 album called Blue Thunder was released under the Juicy Lucy name by Paul Williams and Micky Moody, featuring guest musicians Mick Taylor and Andy Summers. Moody and Williams also released an album called Smokestacks, Broomdusters and Hoochie Coochie Men in 2002. Juicy Lucy's version of the song \\"Who Do You Love?\\" was subsequently featured in the video game Shellshock: Nam '67. In 1995, Ray Owen resurrected the band's name and recorded the album Here She Comes Again. The line-up for this recording also included Mike Jarvis (guitar), Andy Doughty (bass), and Spencer Blackledge (drums). This version of the band broke up in 1997, but Owen persevered and joined up with guitarist Steve 'Mr Fish' Fishwick. Although legal problems would not allow them usage of the name Juicy Lucy, the outfit performed as Ray Owen's Moon (Moon being the title of Ray Owen's 1971 solo album). In 2004, bassist Colin Fudge and drummer Paul Fletcher joined the band, after the legal situation had been resolved. This version of Juicy Lucy released the album Do That And You'll Lose It in 2006 and toured the UK with Nazareth. They played at the Cambridge Rock Festival in 2008. In 2009, a new line-up of Juicy Lucy was formed as ‚Äì due to health problems ‚Äì Owen was unable to continue touring on a regular basis. The band was then fronted by singer/guitarist Steve 'Mr Fish' Fishwick, with Paul Fletcher on drums and James Morris on bass, and this line-up continued to tour throughout the UK. In September 2012, Frank Cokayne (on bass guitar) joined Fishwick and Fletcher in the UK-based version of the band. The songs \\"Mississippi Woman\\" and \\"Who Do You Love?\\" (from the band's first album) were regularly performed live by this trio, until they parted ways in 2018. Ray Owen (14 July 1947 - 31 October 2018) occasionally played live in France under the moniker \\"Ray Owen's Juicy Lucy\\", accompanied by Mike Jarvis and Spencer Blackledge from the 1990s incarnation of the band, and latterly with Sylvain Galesso on drums and Rosie Woodland on bass guitar. He also performed solo acoustic sets around the UK, including regular engagements at the Lewes Con Club, before his death from cancer in 2018, aged 71. \\"Ray Owen\\", MarshalAmp.com.

Sold exclusively in Japan via Toyota Store locations, the Mega Cruiser was also used by prefectural police, the Japan Auto Federation and fire/rescue departments. As of 2020, it was reported that Toyota had produced 3,000 units before production was halted. A total of 133 Mega Cruisers were sold to civilians. History A prototype of the Toyota Mega Cruiser was first presented to the public at the 30th Tokyo Motor Show in October 1993. Production began in late 1995 at Toyota's Gifu Auto Body subsidiary before sales began in 1996. All Mega Cruiser production was reported to have been halted in 2001 while sales officially ended in 2002. The reason being slow sales due to strict vehicle taxes and Japan having a lot of narrow streets. Some Mega Cruisers were sold overseas from Japan as gray imports. Development The Mega Cruiser was designed as a 4-door full-size SUV and features a 4.1 L turbo diesel inline-4 engine. The engine was rated at and of torque at 1,800 rpm while also being very robust.

It has since been passed to new management, and operates in 2018, with a $1.1 million dollar budget. Primarily Primates employs 16 people for management and care staff, and a full-time veterinarian to assure high standards, excellent animal care and rescue, enrichment, and nutrition.  Background  Animals at the shelter include primates formerly used in animal research, chimpanzees retired from the United States Air Force (mostly Holloman Air Force Base) and the NASA space program, and Oliver, a chimpanzee exhibited around the world for many years and often referred to as the \\"humanzee,\\" because of speculation in the past that he might be part human.

An Austin probate court put the sanctuary into temporary receivership and appointed a primate expert, Lee Theisen-Watt, to evaluate the animals' condition and supervise their care. The attorney general asked the court permanently to remove Wally Swett and his associates, and require them to repay some of the funds that were allegedly misspent. In April 2007, a settlement was reached appointing a new board of directors, which placed Priscilla Feral, president of Friends of Animals, a Connecticut-based animal-rights group that funded Primarily Primates as its president of the board. At the conclusion of the Receivership, spokesman Kelly for the attorney-general's office said in a statement that \\"[t]he troubling conditions at Primarily Primates have been remedied.\\" Temporary receivership The controversy began when a former volunteer of the sanctuary set up undercover footage showing sick animals and primates confined in small cages.Smith, Jordan.

The courts dismissed the lawsuit, but the controversy continued. Both sides made serious allegations against the other, with PETA maintaining a highly critical website called Primarily Primates: Hell On Earth For Animals. The Texas attorney general's office ordered the takeover of the sanctuary on Friday, October 13, 2006, and the appointment of a temporary receiver. Lee Theisen-Watt, a primatologist, was placed in charge of the sanctuary. Confirming overcrowding and claiming inadequate conditions, she began relocating animals to appropriate facilities, and after Friends of Animals took over management of the sanctuary, some of the animals were returned.

She has lived in Duluth and currently St. Paul, Minnesota. In 2009, she moved to Portland, Oregon, where she spent a year writing songs for her album Golder, which was released April 19, 2011. She plays acoustic guitar, baritone electric guitar, electric guitar, and Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano, either solo or with her Twin Cities-based band, including Jeremy Ylvisaker, Robert Skoro, and Jacob Hanson. Life and work Haley in 2016 In 2003 Haley's album . . . The Size of Planets (Chairkicker's Union) received favorable reviews in the Twin Cities press. The album spawned the single \\"Am I Allowed,\\" which was played on college radio stations. McCallum was 20 years old when the album was released, and did a number of tours with Duluth band Low upon its release. She also toured with Mason Jennings, Richard Buckner, Rivulets, and Mary Lou Lord, who was also Haley's manager for a time. In 2006 she released the album Lure the Fox, originally on Mary Ellen Recordings, whose owner, Mary Lewis, decided to help her pay to record the album at Pachyderm Studio after reading a Star Tribune article about her in 2005. Dave King of Happy Apple and The Bad Plus plays drums, Chris Morrissey plays bass, and the album features Low's Alan Sparhawk on the track \\"Give it Up.\\" Also on that track is David Frankenfeld, Haley's former drummer, who played on The Size of Planets. One year after Lure the Fox was recorded, Haley signed with local label Afternoon Records, who then released the album nationally in October 2006. Lure the Fox earned Haley two Minnesota Music Awards, one for Best American Roots recording, and another for Best American Roots artist. The album also topped many Twin Cities year-end favorite lists, including those of the Star Tribune, City Pages, The Onion, and Pulse magazine. Haley was also featured on the cover of Metro magazine. Big Star, released in June 2008 on Afternoon Records, gained Haley a broader audience with songs like \\"Big Star,\\" \\"Green Eyed Boy,\\" and \\"Arms of Harm,\\" which was featured on the credits for an episode of Showtime's The United States of Tara. Haley is featured on the 2007 Andrew Bird record Armchair Apocrypha and has frequently shared the stage with Bird over the past five years. She sang on the feature song \\"Quiet Breathing\\" from the independent film Sweet Land, directed by fellow Minnesotan Ali Selim. In recent years, she has also collaborated with Actual Wolf and Gary Louris. In 2009, McCallum's move from St. Paul to Portland, Oregon was noted by City Pages. She returned to the St. Paul in July 2010 and again became very active in the Twin Cities music scene. Upon completion of her album Golder, released in 2011, she also started a side project band called Gramma's Boyfriend, a \\"no-wave, new wave, punkish kind of thing that sounds like the Twin Peaks High School prom band.\\" Jeremy Ylvisaker (Andrew Bird, Alpha Consumer, Guitar Party), Jacob Hanson (Halloween, Alaska, Guitar Party, Minneapolis Dub Ensemble), Haley Bonar, Luke Anderson (Rogue Valley, Alpha Centauri), and Mike Lewis (Happy Apple, Fat Kid Wednesdays, Andrew Bird, Gayngs) are all members of Gramma's Boyfriend, though the band's website states that \\"sometimes they all play together, sometimes its whoever shows up.\\" They have released two albums on Graveface Records, 2013's Human Eye and 2015's Perm. Haley at a Hillary Clinton campaign event After two and a half years of writing and recording, Haley released the album Last War in May 2014. The album earned widespread critical acclaim, with Stephen Thompson of NPR calling Haley \\"a bright, subtle storyteller, [who] displays a mastery of pop-rock craftsmanship that keeps these songs as relentlessly catchy on the surface as they are alluringly complex underneath.\\" SPIN lauded the track \\"No Sensitive Man\\" as \\"dynamic, demanding,\\" while Consequence of Sound stated that \\"Bonar creates a whimsical masterclass of indie-pop songwriting.\\" The album earned spots on best-of-2014 lists from Rough Trade, NPR's All Songs Considered, Village Voice and Wondering Sound, the latter of which said of the album, \\"It‚Äôs a bold, confident statement, and it‚Äôs an early pick for one of the year‚Äôs best.\\" Her album 'Impossible Dream' was released in August 2016. Her latest album 'Pleasureland' is recorded under the name HALEY and was released in 2018.

Published 2 September 1871 in Harper's Weekly Anti-Irish sentiment, also called Hibernophobia, may refer to or include oppression, persecution, discrimination, or hatred of Irish people as an ethnic group or nation, whether directed against the island of Ireland in general or against Irish emigrants and their descendants in the Irish diaspora. It is traditionally rooted in the Middle Ages, Early Modern Age and in the Age of Enlightenment and is also evidenced in Irish immigration to Great Britain, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Anti-Irish sentiment can include social, racial and cultural discrimination in Ireland itself, such as sectarianism or cultural religious political conflicts in the Troubles of Northern Ireland. Perspective An Irishman depicted as a gorilla (\\"Mr. G. O'Rilla\\") The first record of Anti-Irish sentiment comes from the Greek geographer, Strabo, in his work Geographica: \\"Besides some small islands round about Britain, there is also a large island, Ierne, which stretches parallel to Britain on the north, its breadth being greater than its length. Concerning this island I have nothing certain to tell, except that its inhabitants are more savage than the Britons, since they are man-eaters as well as heavy eaters, and since, further, they count it an honourable thing, when their fathers die, to devour them, and openly to have intercourse, not only with the other women, but also with their mothers and sisters; but I am saying this only with the understanding that I have no trustworthy witnesses for it; and yet, as for the matter of man-eating, that is said to be a custom of the Scythians also, and, in cases of necessity forced by sieges, the Celti, the Iberians, and several other peoples are said to have practised it.\\"Strabo, Geographica 4.5.4 The most famous example of Anti-Irish sentiment comes from 1190 with the Norman chronicler Giraldus Cambrensis, also known as Gerald of Wales. To justify the Norman invasion of Ireland, he wrote disparagingly of the Irish. \\"Gerald was seeking promotion by Henry II within the English church. His history was therefore written to create a certain effect‚Äîof supporting Henry II's claims to Ireland.\\" Over the centuries, hostility increased towards the Irish, who steadfastly remained Roman Catholic in spite of coercive force by Edward VI and subsequent rulers to convert them to Protestantism.John Richardson, A Short History of the Attempts that have been Made to Convert the Popish Natives of Ireland, to the Establish'd Religion: with a Proposal for their Conversion, London, 1712, p. 15. Retrieved 8 August 1712. The religious majority of the Irish nation was ruled by a religious minority, leading to perennial social conflict. During the Great Famine in the middle of the 19th century, some evangelical Protestants sought to convert the starving Catholics as part of their relief efforts.\\"‚ÄòThe Widow‚Äôs Mite‚Äô: private relief during the Great Famine,\\" from 18th‚Äì19th Century Social Perspectives, 18th‚Äì19th ‚Äì Century History, Features, Issue 2 (Mar/Apr 2008), The Famine, Volume 16, reprinted online by History Ireland, 2015. Retrieved 8 August 2015. History Pre-Modern era Negative English attitudes towards the Gaelic Irish and their culture date as far back as the reign of Henry II of England. In 1155, Pope Adrian IV issued the papal bull called Laudabiliter, that gave Henry permission to conquer Ireland as a means of strengthening the Papacy's control over the Irish Church.Austin Lane Poole. From Domesday book to Magna Carta, 1087‚Äì1216. Oxford University Press 1993. pp. 303‚Äì304. Pope Adrian called the Irish a \\"rude and barbarous\\" nation. Thus, the Norman invasion of Ireland began in 1169 with the backing of the Papacy. Pope Alexander III, who was Pope at the time of the invasion, ratified the Laudabiliter and gave Henry dominion over Ireland. He likewise called the Irish a \\"barbarous nation\\" with \\"filthy practices\\".Hull, Eleanor. \\"POPE ADRIAN'S BULL \\"LAUDABILITER\\" AND NOTE UPON IT\\", from A History of Ireland and Her People (1931). Gerald of Wales accompanied King Henry's son, John, on his 1185 trip to Ireland. As a result of this he wrote Topographia Hibernica (\\"Topography of Ireland\\") and Expugnatio Hibernia (\\"Conquest of Ireland\\"), both of which remained in circulation for centuries afterwards. Ireland, in his view, was rich; but the Irish were backward and lazy: > They use their fields mostly for pasture. Little is cultivated and even less > is sown. The problem here is not the quality of the soil but rather the lack > of industry on the part of those who should cultivate it. This laziness > means that the different types of minerals with which hidden veins of the > earth are full are neither mined nor exploited in any way. They do not > devote themselves to the manufacture of flax or wool, nor to the practice of > any mechanical or mercantile act. Dedicated only to leisure and laziness, > this is a truly barbarous people. They depend on animals for their > livelihood and they live like animals.Gerald of Wales, Giraldus, John Joseph > O'Meara. The History and Topography of Ireland. Penguin Classics, 1982. Page > 102. Gerald was not atypical, and similar views may be found in the writings of William of Malmesbury and William of Newburgh. When it comes to Irish marital and sexual customs Gerald is even more biting: \\"This is a filthy people, wallowing in vice. They indulge in incest, for example in marrying ‚Äì or rather debauching ‚Äì the wives of their dead brothers\\". Even earlier than this Archbishop Anselm accused the Irish of wife swapping, \\"exchanging their wives as freely as other men exchange their horses\\". One will find these views echoed centuries later in the words of Sir Henry Sidney, twice Lord Deputy of Ireland during the reign of Elizabeth I, and in those of Edmund Tremayne, his secretary. In Tremayne's view the Irish \\"commit whoredom, hold no wedlock, ravish, steal and commit all abomination without scruple of conscience\\".James West Davidson. Nation of Nations: A Concise Narrative of the American Republic. McGraw-Hill, 1996. Page 27. In A View of the Present State of Ireland, circulated in 1596 but not published until 1633, the English official and renowned poet Edmund Spenser wrote \\"They are all papists by profession but in the same so blindingly and brutishly informed that you would rather think them atheists or infidels\\". In a \\"Brief Note on Ireland,\\" Spenser argued that \\"Great force must be the instrument but famine must be the means, for till Ireland be famished it cannot be subdued. . . There can be no conformity of government where is no conformity of religion. . . There can be no sound agreement between two equal contraries viz: the English and Irish\\".Hastings, Adrian (1997). The Construction of Nationhood: Ethnicity, Religion and Nationalism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. , . pp. 83‚Äì84. This \\"civilising mission\\" embraced any manner of cruel and barbaric methods to accomplish its end goal. For instance, in 1305, Piers Bermingham received a financial bonus and accolades in verse after beheading thirty members of the O'Conor clan and sending them to Dublin. In 1317, one Irish chronicler opined that it was just as easy for an Englishman to kill an Irishman or English woman to kill an Irish woman as he/she would a dog. The Irish were thought of as the most barbarous people in Europe, and such ideas were modified to compare the Scottish Highlands or G√†idhealtachd where traditionally Scottish Gaelic is spoken to medieval Ireland.Travels to terra incognita: the Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in early modern travellers accounts. c1600-1800.

Journal of Social History issn.36.2 pp.405‚Äì429 In the Early Modern period following the advent of Protestantism in Great Britain, the Irish people suffered both social and political oppression for refusing to renounce Catholicism. This discrimination sometimes manifested itself in areas with large Puritan or Presbyterian populations such as the northeastern parts of Ireland, the Central Belt of Scotland, and parts of Canada.The Irish in Atlantic Canada, 1780‚Äì1900IRISH IMMIGRANTS AND CANADIAN DESTINIES IN MARGARET ATWOOD'S \\"ALIAS GRACE\\" Ecaterina Han≈£iu University of Oradea. Thinly veiled nationalism under the guise of religious conflict has occurred in both the UK and Ireland.Irish society: sociological perspectives By Patrick Clancy Anti-Irish sentiment is found in works by several 18th-century writers such as Voltaire, who depicted the Catholic Irish as savage and backward, and defended British rule in the country.\\"Voltaire's writing, particular in this field of history, show by this stage in his career Ireland and the Catholic Irish had become shorthand reference to extreme religious fanaticism and general degeneracy\\".Gargett, Graham: \\"Some Reflections on Voltaire's L'lngenu and a Hitherto Neglected Source: the Questions sur les miracles\\" in The Secular City: Studies in the Enlightenment : Presented to Haydn Mason edited by T.

Hemming, Edward Freeman, David Meakin University of Exeter Press, 1994 . 19th century Irish racism in Victorian Britain and 19th century United States included the stereotyping of the Irish as violent and alcoholic. Some English illustrators depicted a prehistoric \\"ape-like image\\" of Irish faces to bolster evolutionary racist claims that the Irish people were an \\"inferior race\\" as compared to Anglo-Saxons.Wohl, Anthony S. (1990) \\"Racism and Anti-Irish Prejudice in Victorian England\\". The Victorian WebL.P. Curtis, Apes and Angels: The Irishman in Victorian Caricature (1971) However, Victorian cartoons of other relatively poor groups such as the \\"Skeleton Army\\" also show ape-like features, and arguably the \\"racism\\" was a disdain for all poor and therefore uncivilsed people. Similar to other immigrant populations, they were sometimes accused of cronyism and subjected to misrepresentations of their religious and cultural beliefs. Irish Catholics were particularly singled out for attack by Protestants. Anti-Catholicism, whether real or imagined, played to the Catholic respect for martyrdom, and was partly based on a fear of a reborn Inquisition whose methods clashed with the \\"Age of Enlightenment\\". Irish Catholics were not involved in formulating church dogma, but it became a stick to beat them with. Mostly they stayed with their church as it fostered a sense of community in an otherwise harsh commercial world. In Liverpool, England, where many Irish immigrants settled following the Great Famine, anti-Irish prejudice was widespread. The sheer numbers of people coming across the Irish sea and settling in the poorer districts of the city led to physical attacks and it became common practice for those with Irish accents or even Irish names to be barred from jobs, public houses and employment opportunities. In 1836, young Benjamin Disraeli wrote: In 1882, five people were murdered in the Maamtrasna, on the border between County Mayo and County Galway in Ireland. Covering the incident, London-based magazine The Spectator wrote the following: Nineteenth-century Protestant American \\"Nativist\\" discrimination against Irish Catholics reached a peak in the mid-1850s when the Know-Nothing Movement tried to oust Catholics from public office. Much of the opposition came from Irish Protestants, as in the 1831 riots in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Hoeber, Francis W. (2001) \\"Drama in the Courtroom, Theater in the Streets: Philadelphia's Irish Riot of 1831\\" Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography 125(3): 191‚Äì232. ISSN 0031-4587 During the 1830s in the U.S., riots for control of job sites broke out in rural areas among rival labour teams from different parts of Ireland, and between Irish and local American work teams competing for construction jobs.Prince, Carl E. (1985) \\"The Great 'Riot Year': Jacksonian Democracy and Patterns of Violence in 1834.\\" Journal of the Early Republic 5(1): 1‚Äì19. ISSN 0275-1275 examines 24 episodes including the January labor riot at the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, the New York City election riot in April, the Philadelphia race riot in August, and the Baltimore & Washington Railroad riot in November. Irish Catholics were isolated and marginalized by Protestant society, but the Irish gained control of the Catholic Church from English, French and Germans. Intermarriage between Catholics and Protestants was strongly discouraged by both Protestant ministers and Catholic priests. Catholics, led by the Irish, built a network of parochial schools and colleges, as well as orphanages and hospitals, typically using nuns as an inexpensive work force. They thereby avoided public institutions mostly controlled by Protestants. The Irish used their base in Tammany Hall (the Democratic Party machine in New York City) to play a role in the New York State legislature. Young Theodore Roosevelt was their chief Republican opponent, and he wrote in his diary that: :There are some twenty five Irish Democrats in the house.... They are a stupid, sodden and vicious lot, most of them being equally deficient in brains and virtue. Three or four however...seem to be pretty good men, and among the best members of the house are two Republican farmers named O'neil and Sheehy, the grandsons of Irish immigrants. But the average catholic Irishman of first-generation as represented in this Assembly, is a low, venal, corrupt and unintelligent brute. =\\"No Irish need apply\\"= After 1860, many Irish sang songs about signs and notices reading Help wanted ‚Äì no Irish need apply or similar. The 1862 song \\"No Irish Need Apply\\", written and performed by Mrs F. R. Phillips,\\"No Irish need apply\\", Folk Song and Music Hall. Retrieved 25 August 2020 was inspired by such signs in London. Later Irish Americans adapted the lyrics and the songs to reflect the discrimination they felt in America. Historians have debated the issue of anti-Irish job discrimination in the United States. Some insist that the \\"No Irish need apply\\" (or \\"NINA\\") signs were common, but others, such as Richard J. Jensen, argue that anti-Irish job discrimination was not a significant factor in the United States, and these signs and print advertisements were posted by the limited number of early 19th-century English immigrants to the United States who shared the prejudices of their homeland. In July 2015 the same journal that published Jensen's 2002 paper published a rebuttal by Rebecca A. Fried, an 8th-grade student at Sidwell Friends School. She listed multiple instances of the restriction used in advertisements for many different types of positions, including \\"clerks at stores and hotels, bartenders, farm workers, house painters, hog butchers, coachmen, bookkeepers, blackers, workers at lumber yards, upholsterers, bakers, gilders, tailors, and papier mache workers, among others.\\" While the greatest number of NINA instances occurred in the 1840s, Fried found instances for its continued use throughout the subsequent century, with the most recent dating to 1909 in Butte, Montana. Alongside \\"No Irish Need Apply\\" signs, in the post-World War II years, signs saying \\"No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs\\" or similar anti-Irish sentiment are reported to begin to appear in the United Kingdom. 20th century Ku Klux Klan cartoon (1926) depicting Saint Patrick being driven out of America, along with snakes marked \\"Rome in Politics\\", \\"Knights of Columbus\\", \\"superstition\\" and other evils associated with Irish Americans. The writer H.P. Lovecraft held very anti-Irish views. In 1921, concerning the possibility of an independent Irish state, he said the following: \\"If the Irish had the ‚Äòright‚Äô to independence they would possess it. If they ever gain it, they will possess it ‚Äì until they lose it again. England has the right to rule because she does‚Ä¶ It is not chance, but racial superiority, which has made the Briton supreme.

Priestley published the travelogue English Journey, in which he wrote \\"A great many speeches have been made and books written on the subject of what England has done to Ireland... I should be interested to hear a speech and read a book or two on the subject of what Ireland has done to England... if we do have an Irish Republic as our neighbour, and it is found possible to return her exiled citizens, what a grand clearance there will be in all the western ports, from the Clyde to Cardiff, what a fine exit of ignorance and dirt and drunkenness and disease.\\"J. B. Priestley, English Journey (London: William Heinemann, 1934), pp. 248‚Äì9 Since the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921, there has been tension and violence between its two main communities. Most of the Irish nationalist/republican community are Catholic and see themselves as Irish, while most of the unionist/loyalist community are Protestant and see themselves as British. Since the Troubles began in the late 1960s, loyalists have consistently expressed anti-Irish sentiment. Irish tricolours have been burnt on the yearly Eleventh Night bonfires.

The Provisional IRA's bombings in England led to fear, anti-Irish sentiment and attacks on the Irish community there. After the Birmingham pub bombings, for example, there were reports of isolated attacks on Irish people and Irish-owned businesses in the Australian press. In the 1990s, writers for the Daily Mail newspaper \\"called for Irish people to be banned from UK sporting events and fined for IRA disruption to public transport\\", one of numerous opinions expressed over many years which has led the Daily Mail to be accused by some in Ireland of publishing \\"some of the most virulently anti-Irish journalism in Britain for decades\\".\\"Anti-Irish newspaper plans to launch edition here\\".

It claimed that far-right British nationalist groups continued to use \\"anti-IRA\\" marches as \\"an excuse to attack and intimidate Irish immigrants\\". Shortly before the 2012 Summer Olympics, British athlete Daley Thompson was shown an image of a runner with a misspelt tattoo, and said that the person responsible for the misspelling must have been Irish. The BBC issued an apology. In March 2012 in Perth, Australia, one classified ad placed by a bricklayer stated \\"No Irish\\" should apply for the job. On 8 August 2012, an article appeared in Australian newspapers titled \\"Punch Drunk: Ireland intoxicated as Taylor swings towards boxing gold\\". The article claimed that Katie Taylor was not \\"what you'd expect in a fighting Irishwoman, nor is she surrounded by people who'd prefer a punch to a potato\\". The journalist who wrote it apologised for \\"indulging racial stereotypes\\". The following day, Australian commentator Russell Barwick asserted that athletes from Ireland should compete for the British Olympic team, likening it to \\"an Hawaiian surfer not surfing for the USA\\". When fellow presenter Mark Chapman explained that the Republic of Ireland was an independent state, Barwick remarked: \\"It's nothing but an Irish joke\\". On 25 June 2013, In an Orange Order HQ in Everton, an Irish flag was burned. This was seen by members of Liverpool's large Irish community as a hate crime. In December 2014 British broadcaster Channel 4 caused an \\"outrage\\" and \\"fury\\" in Ireland and the UK when it planned a comedy series about the Irish Famine. The sitcom named Hungry, was announced by writer Hugh Travers, who said \\"we‚Äôre kind of thinking of it as Shameless in famine Ireland.\\" The response in Ireland was quick and negative: \\"Jewish people would never endorse making a comedy of the mass extermination of their ancestors at the hands of the Nazis, Cambodians would never support people laughing at what happened to their people at the hands of the Khmer Rouge and the people of Somalia, Ethiopia or Sudan would never accept the plight of their people, through generational famine, being the source of humour in Britain,\\" Dublin councillor David McGuinness said. \\"I am not surprised that it is a British television outlet funding this venture.\\" The writer defended the concept saying, \\"Comedy equals tragedy plus time.\\" Channel 4 issued a press release stating that \\"This in the development process and is not currently planned to air...

In 2013, Irish journalist Jennifer O'Connell, writing in The Irish Times, wrote that \\"Our casual racism against Travellers is one of Ireland's last great shames\\". While there is a willingness to acknowledge that there is widespread prejudice towards Travellers in Irish society, and a recognition of discrimination against Travellers, there is still strong resistance among the Irish public to calling the treatment of Travellers racist. Extensive abuses of social systems like the housing scheme, welfare schemes, and resource teachers for Travellers in primary schools perpetuate the social conflict between Travellers and \\"the settled community\\", examples including the burning down of houses allocated to the Travellers by the state due to Traveller feuds. These feuds between large Traveller families often culminate in mass brawls where dozens of Travellers cause damage to themselves as well as public and private property. In 2013 a Traveller home in Ballyshannon, Co Donegal was destroyed by fire days before members of a Traveller family were due to move in. Local Councillor Pearse Doherty said the house was specifically targeted because it was to house a Traveller family and was destroyed due to a 'hatred of Travellers'. Another local Councillor Sean McEniff of Bundoran caused controversy and a complaint under the 'Incitement to Hatred Act' when he stated that, due to the house's initial purchase, Travellers \\"should live in isolation from the settled community.\\" and \\"I would not like these people (the family) living beside me\\". The British television series Big Fat Gypsy Weddings has been accused of bullying and an instigation of racial hatred against Irish Travellers in England. The series has faced a number of controversies, including allegations of racism in its advertising and instigating a rise in the rate of racially motivated bullying.

Career Kelvin Mercer (\\"Posdnuos\\", \\"Plug One\\", \\"Plug Wonder Why\\", \\"Mercenary\\") and David Jude Jolicoeur (\\"Trugoy the Dove\\", \\"Plug Two\\", \\"Dave\\") were already friends when Mason joined the pair to form De La Soul in 1987. The trio came to the attention of Prince Paul, then a member of Stetsasonic, with a demo recording of \\"Plug Tunin'\\". Paul facilitated a record deal for Mason and his colleagues with the Tommy Boy label and produced their first album, 3 Feet High and Rising. Mason's role in De La Soul is primarily that of a DJ, with Mason stating that he is ‚Äúa b-boy to my heart‚Äù, drawing inspiration from life experience and contemporary global events. However, Mason has also featured as a vocalist on songs such as \\"Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)\\" (from De La Soul Is Dead) and for De La Soul's guest appearance on the Jungle Brothers recording, \\"Doin' Our Own Dang\\". Mason also recorded the introductory laugh for De La Soul's collaboration with Gorillaz, \\"Feel Good Inc.\\".

He spent 13 years in the minor leagues and 23 years in the major leagues, a total of 36 years in professional baseball. Kaiser wore uniform number 21 when the AL adopted numbers for umpires in 1980. Umpiring career Kaiser officiated in the World Series in 1987 and 1997, as well as the All-Star Game in 1991. He also umpired in the American League Championship Series in 1980, 1988, 1993 and 1995 (Game 6), and in the American League Division Series in 1981, 1996 and 1997. He also worked the single-game playoff to decide the AL West champion in . On May 6, 1982, he was home plate umpire for Gaylord Perry's 300th career victory. Before reaching the major leagues, Kaiser worked as a professional wrestler, wearing a black hood and being known as \\"The Hatchet Man.\\" In his brief stint as a professional wrestler, he wrestled such famous opponents as Haystacks Calhoun. In 1986, Kaiser was voted the Most Colorful Umpire in the American League in a poll by The Sporting News. He was voted the worst umpire in the AL in a poll of players during 1999 spring training. Later that year, he was among the umpires who submitted their resignations in a failed gambit by the Major League Umpires Association, and he was not among those later re-hired following union negotiations and litigation. Weight During a period in which many umpires were criticized for their weights, Kaiser was the heaviest in the AL; he was listed at from 1983 through 1998. Apart from the unlikelihood that he maintained that precise weight for fifteen years, there are ample reasons to believe that his weight topped for much of that time. Although he noted in his 2003 autobiography that he already weighed in high school, the AL listed his weight at from 1977 to 1979 and at 200 from 1980 to 1982 before revising the figure to in 1983. Also, the heaviest umpires during that era in the National League‚ÄîJohn McSherry, listed at from 1992 to 1996, and Eric Gregg, listed at were both later noted as actually exceeding those figures significantly; McSherry, who died on the field of a heart attack in 1996, was believed to have approached and Gregg also conceded that his weight approached that level. After McSherry's death, Gregg took a two-month leave of absence in which he lost but was still listed at the following year. The major leagues strongly encouraged other umpires to reduce their weight during that period, though Kaiser's was still listed at for two more years before dropping to in his final season. In a June 2004 column for ESPN's MLB Insider, pitcher Tom Candiotti recalled that Kaiser \\"wouldn't move three steps to call a play.\\" Candiotti's assessment of Kaiser was seconded by one of his American League colleagues, Durwood Merrill, who noted that Kaiser usually \\"marched to the beat of his own drummer\\" in his autobiography, You're Out and You're Ugly, Too. Later years Kaiser's 2003 autobiography, written with the help of author David Fisher, is entitled Planet of the Umps: A Baseball Life From Behind the Plate.

Sigma factors are proteins that regulate transcription in bacteria. Sigma factors can be activated in response to different environmental conditions. rpoS is transcribed in late exponential phase, and RpoS is the primary regulator of stationary phase genes. RpoS is a central regulator of the general stress response and operates in both a retroactive and a proactive manner: it not only allows the cell to survive environmental challenges, but it also prepares the cell for subsequent stresses (cross-protection). The transcriptional regulator CsgD is central to biofilm formation, controlling the expression of the curli structural and export proteins, and the diguanylate cyclase, adrA, which indirectly activates cellulose production. The rpoS gene most likely originated in the gammaproteobacteria.  Environmental signal to activation: regulation of RpoS  Regulatory mechanisms that control RpoS exist at various levels of gene and protein organization: transcription, translation, degradation, and protein activity. These processes occur in response to stresses such as near-UV radiation, acid, temperature or osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation. While many key regulatory entities have been identified in these areas, the precise mechanisms by which they signal rpoS transcription, translation, proteolysis or activity remain largely uncharacterized.  Transcriptional control of rpoS  Transcription of rpoS in E. coli is mainly regulated by the chromosomal rpoSp promoter. rpoSp promotes transcription of rpoS mRNA, and is induced upon entry into stationary phase in cells growing on rich media via an unknown mechanism. Flanking rpoSp are two putative cAMP-CRP (cyclic AMP-cAMP receptor protein) binding sites that seem to control rpoS transcription in an antagonistic manner. The position of the first site upstream of the major rpoS promoter corresponds to a ‚Äúclassical activator‚Äù similarly found in the lac promoter thereby suggesting that its effects on transcription are activating (Lange and Hengge-Aronis, 1994); in contrast, the location of the second cAMP-CRP site is indicative of inhibitory action. In exponential phase, crp mutants exhibit high levels of rpoS expression, suggesting that cAMP-CRP inhibits rpoS transcription. Upon entry into stationary phase, on the other hand, cAMP-CRP may upregulate rpoS transcription (Hengge-Aronis, 2002). While these observations may explain the seemingly dual nature of the cAMP-CRP binding sites, they require an explanation of phase-dependent selection of cAMP-CRP site activation to fully account for the contradictory data. Additional regulatory controls for rpoS transcription include: BarA, a Histidine sensor kinase which can activate OmpR and thereby promote porin synthesis; levels of small molecules such as ppGppp which may hinder transcriptional elongation or stability in response to amino acid limitation, or carbon, nitrogen or phosphorus starvation (Gentry et al., 1993). Despite the numerous controls on rpoS transcription, cellular rpoS mRNA levels remain high during exponential phase and the majority of extracellular stimuli do not significantly affect rpoS transcription.  Translational control of rpoS  Most RpoS expression is determined at the translational level. sRNAs (small noncoding RNAs) sense environmental changes and in turn increase rpoS mRNA translation to allow the cell to accordingly adjust to external stress. The promoter of the 85 nucleotide sRNA DsrA contains a temperature-sensitive transcription initiation thermocontrol as it is repressed at high (42ÀöC) temperatures, but induces (perhaps by complementary binding to) rpoS at low (25ÀöC) temperatures. Another sRNA, RprA, stimulates rpoS translation in response to cell surface stress signaled via the RcsC sensor kinase. A third type of sRNA, OxyS, is regulated by OxyR, the primary sensor of oxidative shock. The mechanism by which OxyS interferes with rpoS mRNA translational efficiency is not known. However, the RNA-binding protein Hfq is implicated in the process. Hfq binds to rpoS mRNA in vitro and may thereby modify rpoS mRNA structure for optimal translation. Hfq activates both DsrA and RprA. In contrast, LeuO inhibits rpoS translation by repressing dsrA expression and the histone-like protein HN-S (and its paralog StpA) inhibits rpoS translation via an unknown mechanism. In addition, H-NS, LeuO, Hfq and DsrA form an interconnected regulatory network that ultimately controls rpoS translation. RpoS translation was also shown to be controlled in other bacterial species, beside Escherichia coli. E.g., in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa the sRNA ReaL translationally silences rpoS mRNA.  RpoS degradation  RpoS proteolysis forms another level of the sigma factor‚Äôs regulation. Degradation occurs via ClpXP, a barrel-shaped protease composed of two six-subunit rings of the ATP-dependent ClpX chaperone that surround two seven-subunit rings of ClpP (Repoila et al., 2003). The response regulator RssB has been identified as a œÉS-specific recognition factor crucial for RpoS degradation. Additional factors known to regulate RpoS proteolysis but via incompletely characterized mechanisms include: RssA which is found on the same operon as RssB; H-NS and DnaK, both of which also regulate rpoS mRNA translation, and LrhA; and acetyl phosphate affects RpoS proteolysis by possibly acting as a phosphoryl donor to RssB.  The RpoS regulon  Consistent with its role as the master controller of the bacterial stress response, RpoS regulates the expression of stress-response genes that fall into various functional categories: stress resistance, cell morphology, metabolism, virulence and lysis. Stress resistance Many genes under RpoS control confer stress resistance to assaults such as DNA damage, presence of reactive oxygen species and osmotic shock. The product of xthA is an exonuclease that participates in DNA repair by recognizing and removing 5‚Äô monophosphates near abasic sites in damaged DNA. Likewise, catalases HPI and HPII, encoded by katG and katE convert harmful hydrogen peroxide molecules to water and oxygen. The otsBA gene product trehalose functions as an osmoprotectant and is needed for desiccation resistance. Additional RpoS- dependent factors involved in oxidative stress include glutathione reductase (encoded by gor), and superoxide dismutase (encoded by sodC). It has also been found, using comparative proteomic analysis with B. pseudomallei, that rpoS regulates eight oxidative responsive proteins including ScoA (a SCOT subunit) not previously known for oxidative stress response involvement. The regulatory effect in this case is RpoS down regulation of SCOT expression in response to oxidative stress in B. pseudomallei.  Morphology  RpoS-dependent genes involved in changes in cell membrane permeability and general cell morphology mostly belong to the osm family of genes. osmB encodes an outer membrane lipoprotein that may play a role in cell aggregation (Jung et al., 1990) , whereas osmY encodes a periplasmic protein. Additional RpoS-dependent factors that determine the size and shape of the cell include the morphogene bolA and products of the ftsQAZ operon that play a role in the timing of cell division . Control of cell shape, cell division and cell-cell interaction are likely to be important in inhibiting cell proliferation and thus allocating resources to cell survival during periods of stress.  Metabolism  Metabolically- optimal survival conditions include RpoS-dependent decreased Krebs cycle activity and increased glycolytic activity to limit the reactive oxygen species that are byproduced as a result of essential cellular processes. Pyruvate entry into the Krebs cycle is inhibited by the product of the RpoS- dependent gene poxB. An overall slowdown in metabolic activity is consistent with energy conservation and reduced growth during periods of stress.  Virulence  As a defense mechanism, the host environment is hostile to invading pathogens. Therefore, infection can be a stressful event for pathogenic bacteria and control of virulence genes may be temporally correlated with the timing of infection by pathogens. Discovery of RpoS- dependent virulence genes in Salmonella is consistent with RpoS as a general regulator of the stress response: the spv gene found on a virulence plasmid in this bacterium is controlled by RpoS and is required for growth in deep lymphoid tissue such as the spleen and liver.  Lysis  RpoS also plays an important role in regulating cell lysis. Along with OmpR, it upregulates the entericidin (ecnAB) locus which encodes a lysis-inducing toxin . In contrast, ssnA is negatively controlled by RpoS but it also promotes lysis. Paradoxically, lysis is seen as a survival process in certain contexts.

It marked the directorial debut of John Glen, who had worked as editor and second unit director on three other Bond films. The screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson takes its characters and combines elements from the plots from two short stories from Ian Fleming's 1960 For Your Eyes Only collection: the title story and \\"Risico\\". In the plot, Bond attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents. Some writing elements were inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After the science fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and England, while underwater footage was shot in The Bahamas. For Your Eyes Only was released in the UK on 24 June 1981 and in the US two days later; it received a mixed to positive critical reception. The film's reputation has improved over time, with reviewers praising the more serious tone. The film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the company was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film's release. Plot The British information gathering vessel St Georges, which holds the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the system used by the Ministry of Defence to communicate with and co-ordinate the Royal Navy's fleet of Polaris submarines, is sunk after accidentally trawling an old naval mine in the Ionian Sea. MI6 agent James Bond is ordered by the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray and MI6 Chief of Staff, Bill Tanner, to retrieve the ATAC before the Soviets, as the transmitter could order attacks by the submarines' Polaris ballistic missiles. The head of the KGB, General Gogol, has also learned of the fate of the St Georges and already notified his contact in Greece. A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, who had been asked by the British to secretly locate the St Georges, is murdered with his wife by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales. Bond goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales. While spying on Gonzales' villa, Bond is captured by his men, but manages to escape as Gonzales is killed by a crossbow bolt. Outside, he finds the assassin was Melina Havelock, the daughter of Sir Timothy, and the two escape. With the help of Bond, Q uses computerised technology to identify the man Bond saw paying off Gonzales as Belgian underworld enforcer Emile Leopold Locque, and then goes to Locque's possible base in Cortina, Italy. There Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos, who tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, known as \\"the Dove\\" in the Greek underworld, Kristatos' former resistance partner during the Second World War. After Bond goes with Kristatos' prot√©g√©e, figure skater Bibi Dahl, to a biathlon course, a group of three men, which includes East German biathlete (and KGB agent) Eric Kriegler, chases Bond, trying to kill him. Bond escapes and then goes with Ferrara to bid Bibi farewell in an ice rink, where he fends off another attempt on his life by three men in ice hockey gear. Ferrara is killed in Bond's car, with a dove pin in his hand. Bond then travels to Corfu in pursuit of Columbo. There, at the casino, Bond meets Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, 'Countess' Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home with Kristatos' car and driver. The two then spend the night together. In the morning, Lisl and Bond are ambushed by Locque and his men, who run Lisl down, killing her. Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who was a double agent during the resistance and is currently working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. To prove his accusation, Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid on one of Kristatos' opium-processing warehouses in Albania, where Bond encounters Locque and uncovers naval mines similar to the one that sank the St Georges, suggesting it was not an accident. After the warehouse is destroyed, Locque escapes; but Bond gives chase and kills him. Bond then rendezvous with Melina on her yacht. Using her father's daily log, they locate the St Georges and recover the ATAC from the wreckage. However, Kristatos is already on location and is waiting for them when they surface and he takes the ATAC. After the two escape an assassination attempt through shark-infested waters, they discover Kristatos' meeting point with the KGB with the help of Melina's parrot, Max. With the help of Columbo and four of his men, Bond and Melina break into St Cyril's, an abandoned mountaintop monastery. As Columbo confronts Kristatos, Bond kills Kriegler. Bond retrieves the ATAC system and stops Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden flick knife, but is killed by a knife thrown by Columbo; Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond throws it off the cliff, destroying it and declaring D√©tente. Bond and Melina later spend a romantic evening aboard her yacht when he receives a call from the Prime Minister, leaving Max to flirt with the Prime Minister, much to the annoyance of Q, Grey and Tanner. Cast * Roger Moore as James Bond: MI6 agent 007, who is sent to retrieve a stolen \\"ATAC\\" system that could be misused for controlling British military submarines. * Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock: The daughter of marine archaeologists who are murdered while tracking down the ATAC's whereabouts. Bouquet had auditioned for the role of Holly Goodhead in Moonraker, but was unsuccessful. * Topol as Milos Columbo: Kristatos' enemy and former smuggling partner who assists Bond in his mission. Named after Gioacchino Colombo, the Ferrari engine designer, specifically Ferrari 125, which Fleming admired. Topol suggested the pistachios as a trademark of the character, which are used in a scene to orient Columbo's men on where to shoot. * Lynn-Holly Johnson as Bibi Dahl: An ice-skating prodigy with a crush on Bond, who is training with the financial support of Kristatos. Johnson was an ice skater before turning to acting, and achieved second place at the novice level of the 1974 United States Figure Skating Championships. * Julian Glover as Aristotle Kristatos: Initially shown as an ally, later as the main villain. A former war hero turned smuggler, planning to expand his fortune by selling the ATAC to the KGB. Glover had been shortlisted as a possible Bond for Live and Let Die, eventually losing out to Moore. * Michael Gothard as Emile Leopold Locque: A Belgian hired assassin and associate of Kristatos. * Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl von Schlaf: Columbo's mistress. At the time of filming Harris was married to future Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, and the couple lunched with the film's producer Albert R. Broccoli during filming. * John Wyman as Erich Kriegler: An East German Olympic class biathete and Kristatos' second in-command/KGB contact. The academic Jeremy Black said that he resembles Hans of You Only Live Twice and Stamper of Tomorrow Never Dies. * Desmond Llewelyn as Q, the head of MI6's technical department. * Jill Bennett as Jacoba Brink: Bibi's skating coach. * Jack Hedley as Sir Timothy Havelock: Melina's father and a marine archaeologist hired by the British Secret Service to secretly locate the wreck of St. Georges. * Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, M's secretary. * Geoffrey Keen as Sir Frederick Gray: The British Minister of Defence, a politician in the British government. The role, along with Bill Tanner as Chief of Staff, was used to brief Bond in place of M, following the death of Bernard Lee. * James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first appeared on film in The Man with the Golden Gun, although in an un-credited capacity. Villiers presumed he would play the role of M in subsequent films and was disappointed not to be asked; the producers thought him too young for the role and wanted an actor in his 70s. * John Moreno as Luigi Ferrara: 007's MI6 contact in northern Italy. * Walter Gotell as General Gogol: Head of the KGB. * Toby Robins as Iona Havelock: Melina's mother and wife of Sir Timothy. * Jack Klaff as Apostis: One of Kristatos's henchmen and chauffeur. * Stefan Kalipha as Hector Gonzales: A Cuban hitman hired by Kristatos to kill the Havelocks. * Charles Dance as Claus, an associate of Locque. The role was early in Dance's career; in 1989 he would play Ian Fleming in Anglia Television's Goldeneye: The Secret Life of Ian Fleming, a dramatised portrayal of the life of Ian Fleming. * Eva Reuber-Staier as Rublevich: General Gogol's secretary. * Janet Brown as the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who appears in the closing scene alongside John Wells as Denis. * John Hollis as the \\"bald villain in wheelchair\\", voiced by Robert Rietti. The character appears in the pre-credits sequence and is both unnamed and uncredited. The character contains a number of characteristics of Ernst Stavro Blofeld, but could not be identified as such because of the legal reasons surrounding the Thunderball controversy with Kevin McClory claiming sole rights to the Blofeld character, a claim disputed by Eon. * Bob Simmons, who previously portrayed Bond in the gun barrel sequences in the first three films and SPECTRE agent Colonel Jacques Bouvar in Thunderball, cameos as another villain as Gonzales' henchman who falls victim to Bond's exploding Lotus. * Paul Brooke as Bunky Production Eon Productions originally intended to produce For Your Eyes Only after The Spy Who Loved Me. However, after the success of Star Wars in 1977 the producers decided to produce Moonraker instead. For Your Eyes Only marked a change in the make up of the production crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for four subsequent films. The transition in directors resulted in a harder-edged directorial style, with less emphasis on gadgetry and large action sequences in huge arenas (as was favored by Lewis Gilbert). Emphasis was placed on tension, plot and character in addition to a return to Bond's more serious roots, whilst For Your Eyes Only \\"showed a clear attempt to activate some lapsed and inactive parts of the Bond mythology.\\" The film was also a deliberate effort to bring the series more back to reality, following the success of Moonraker in 1979. As co-writer Michael G. Wilson pointed out, \\"If we went through the path of Moonraker things would just get more outlandish, so we needed to get back to basics\\". To that end, the story that emerged was simpler, not one in which the world was at risk, but returning the series to that of a Cold War thriller; Bond would also rely more on his wits than gadgets to survive. Glen decided to symbolically represent it with a scene where Bond's Lotus blows itself up and forces 007 to rely on Melina's more humble Citro√´n 2CV. Since Ken Adam was busy with Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion of Glen, Lamont created realistic scenery, instead of the elaborate set pieces for which the series had been known. Writing Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson. According to Wilson, the ideas from stories could have come from anyone as the outlines were worked out in committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson and stunt coordinators. Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Ian Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only: Risico and For Your Eyes Only. Another set-piece from the novel of Live and Let Die ‚Äì the keelhauling ‚Äì which was unused in the film of the same name, was also inserted into the plot. Other ideas from Fleming were also used in For Your Eyes Only, such as the Identigraph which comes from the novel Goldfinger, where it was originally called the \\"Identicast\\". These elements from Fleming's stories were mixed with a Cold War story centred on the MacGuffin of the ATAC. An initial treatment for \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" was submitted by Ronald Hardy, an English novelist and screenwriter in 1979. Hardy's treatment included the involvement of a character named Julia Havelock whose parents were assassinated by a man named Gonzales. For Your Eyes Only is noted for its pre-title sequence, described variously as either \\"out-of place and disappointing\\" or \\"roaringly enjoyable\\". The scene was shot to introduce a potential new Bond to audiences, thus linking the new actor to elements from previous Bond films (see casting, below). The sequence begins with Bond laying flowers at the grave of his wife Tracy Bond, before a Universal Exports helicopter picks him up for an emergency. Control of the helicopter is taken over by remote control by a bald man in a grey Nehru jacket with a white cat. This character is unnamed in either the film or the credits, although he looks and sounds like Ernst Stavro Blofeld as played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas. Director John Glen referred to the identity of the villain obliquely: \\"We just let people use their imaginations and draw their own conclusions ... It's a legal thing\\". The character is deliberately not named due to copyright restrictions with Kevin McClory, who owned the film rights to Thunderball, which supposedly includes the character Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the organisation SPECTRE, and other material associated with the development of Thunderball. Eon disputed McClory's ownership of the Blofeld character, but decided not to use him again: the scene was \\"a deliberate statement by Broccoli of his lack of need to use the character.\\" Maibaum later said \\"We tried to return to the earlier films with For Your Eyes Only but we didn't have Sean to make it real. And I was very disappointed with the way the love story was handled. The whole idea was that the great lover James Bond can't get to first base with this woman because she was so obsessed with avenging her parents' death. Nothing was ever done with it. It was as if the director didn't feel there was a love story there at all.\\" Casting Roger Moore had originally signed a three- film contract with Eon Productions, which covered his first three appearances up to The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent to this, the actor negotiated contracts on a film-by-film basis. Uncertainty surrounding his involvement in For Your Eyes Only, considering his age, led to other actors being considered to take over, including Lewis Collins, known in the UK for his portrayal of Bodie in The Professionals; Ian Ogilvy, like Moore known by his role in Return of the Saint; Michael Billington, who previously appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me as Agent XXX's ill-fated lover, (Billington's screen test for For Your Eyes Only was one of the five occasions he auditioned for the role of Bond) and Michael Jayston, who had appeared as the eponymous spy in the British TV series of Quiller (Jayston eventually played Bond in a BBC Radio production of You Only Live Twice in 1985). Timothy Dalton was strongly considered but Dalton declined, as he disliked the direction the series was taking at the time. Eventually, this came to nothing as Moore agreed to play Bond once again. Bernard Lee died of cancer on 16 January 1981, after filming began on For Your Eyes Only, but before he could film his scenes as M, the head of MI6, as he had done in the previous eleven films of the series. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role as Broccoli refused to have the character recast and, instead, the script was re-written so that the character is said to be on leave, letting Chief of Staff Bill Tanner take over the role as acting head of MI6 and briefing Bond alongside the Minister of Defence. Chaim Topol was cast following a suggestion by Broccoli's wife Dana, while Julian Glover joined the cast as the producers felt he was stylish ‚Äì Glover was even considered to play Bond at some point, but Michael G. Wilson stated that \\"when we first thought of him he was too young, and by the time of For Your Eyes Only he was too old\\". Carole Bouquet was a suggestion of United Artists publicist Jerry Juroe, and after Glen and Broccoli saw her in That Obscure Object of Desire, they went to Rome to invite Bouquet for the role of Melina. Filming alt=A yellow car drives down a grassy road. Production of For Your Eyes Only began on 2 September 1980 in the North Sea, with three days shooting exterior scenes with the St Georges. The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, as well as the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage. On 15 September principal photography started on Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above Corfu Town, which acted as the location of the Spanish villa. Many of the local houses were painted white for scenographic reasons. Glen opted to use the local slopes and olive trees for the chase scene between Melina's Citro√´n 2CV and Gonzales' men driving Peugeot 504s. The scene was shot across twelve days, with stunt driver R√©my Julienne ‚Äì who would remain in the series up until GoldenEye ‚Äì driving the Citro√´n. Four 2CVs were used, with modifications for the stunts ‚Äì all had more powerful flat-four engines, and one received a special revolving plate on its roof so it could get turned upside down. In October filming moved to other Greek locations, including Meteora and the Achilleion. In November, the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, while the second unit shot underwater scenes in The Bahamas. On 1 January 1981, production moved to Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy, where filming wrapped in February. Since it was not snowing in Cortina d'Ampezzo by the time of filming, the producers had to pay for trucks to bring snow from nearby mountains, which was then dumped in the city's streets. Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater. Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre- existing health condition that prevented her from performing underwater stunt work. Aquatic scenes were done by a team led by Al Giddings, who had previously worked on The Deep, and filmed in either Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage or an underwater set built in the Bahamas. Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune, as well as a mock-up with a fake bottom. Roger Moore was reluctant to film the scene of Bond kicking a car, with Locque inside, over the edge of a cliff, saying that it \\"was Bond-like, but not Roger Moore Bond-like.\\" Michael G. Wilson later said that Moore had to be persuaded to be more ruthless than he felt comfortable. Wilson also added that he and Richard Maibaum, along with John Glen, toyed with other ideas surrounding that scene, but ultimately everyone, even Moore, agreed to do the scene as originally written. Monastery of the Holy Trinity in Meteora served as a locationalt=A monastery stands atop a large mountain. For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop was paid to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly critical of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, it was decided that the monks' only property were the interiors ‚Äì the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery with plastic bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood. Roger Moore said he had a great fear of heights, and to do the climbing in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves. Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling off the side of the cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: \\"From where we were [shooting], you could see the local cemetery; and the box [to stop my fall] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots.\\" The stunt went off without a problem. Bond veteran cameraman and professional skier Willy Bogner, Jr. was promoted to director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, and a set of skis that allowed him to ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, on the final day of filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob. The incident, which took place a week after the FIBT World Championships 1981 where USA-1 bobsled driver James Morgan was killed in a crash during the four-man sled competition, resulted in the shortening of the track for future FIBT events. The pre-credits sequence used a church in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen got the idea for the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made it seem as if the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model. Music The score of For Your Eyes Only was written by Bill Conti, who retained a number of John Barry-influenced brass elements in the score, but also added elements of dance and funk music. While one reviewer observed that \\"Bill Conti's score is a constant source of annoyance\\", another claimed that \\"In the end, For Your Eyes Only stands as one of the best James Bond film scores of the 1980s.\\" The title song, written by Conti and Michael Leeson, was sung by Sheena Easton, who holds the distinction of being the first title song artist to appear on screen in a Bond film, as designer Maurice Binder liked Easton's appearance and decided to add her to the opening credits. The producers of the film hired Debbie Harry to sing Conti and Leeson's song, but she quit when the producers refused to allow her band Blondie to write and perform an original song for the film. Blondie's rejected song, titled \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" can be found on their 1982 album, The Hunter. Release and reception For Your Eyes Only was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on , setting an all-time opening-day record for any film at any cinema in the UK with a gross of ¬£14,998 (¬£ in pounds). The film went on general release in the UK the same day. For Your Eyes Only had its North American premiere in Canada and the US on Friday 26 June, at approximately 1,100 cinemas. alt=An oblong-shaped digital watch. Above the face is the name \\"JAMES BOND\\". Below the face are a stylised \\"007\\" and the logo of the film, \\"FOR YOUR EYES ONLY\\". The film grossed $54.8 million in the United States, (equivalent to $101.5 million at 2011 ticket prices or $ million in dollars, adjusted for general inflation) and $195.3 million worldwide, becoming the second highest grossing Bond film after its predecessor, Moonraker. This was the last James Bond film to be solely released by United Artists, as by this time its owner Transamerica Corporation finalized the sale of the brand to MGM. Following the MGM and United Artists merger, later runs including future entries were released under \\"MGM/UA Distribution Co\\". The promotional cinema poster for the film featured a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left the bottom half of her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is the front of the suit. The poster caused some furor‚Äîlargely in the US‚Äîwith The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle. A number of items of merchandising were issued to coincide with the film, including a 007 digital watch and a copy of Melina's Citro√´n 2CV by Corgi Toys. Citro√´n itself produced a special \\"007\\" edition of the 2CV, which even had decorative bullet holes on the door. Marvel Comics also did a comic book adaptation (see section below). Contemporary reviews Derek Malcolm in The Guardian disliked the film, saying it was \\"too long ... and pretty boring between the stunts\\", although he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality. According to Malcolm, Bond \\"inhabits a fantasy- land of more or less bloodless violence, groinless sex and naivety masked as superior sophistication\\", with Moore playing him as if in a \\"nicely lubricated daze\\". Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success, he observed that he \\"can't quite see why the series has lasted so long and so strong in people's affections.\\" Writing in The Observer, Philip French commented that \\"not for the first time the pre-credits sequence is the best thing about the film.\\" French was dismissive of Moore's Bond, saying that Bond was \\"impersonated by Moore\\" and referred to Moore's advancing years. Ian Christie, writing in the Daily Express, said that it was not \\"much of a plot, but it has a touch of credibility which is a welcome change from some of its predecessors.\\" Overall, Christie thought, For Your Eyes Only was \\"one of the better Bonds, with a nice balance between humour and excitement and the usual bevy of beautiful girls.\\" Christie's colleague in the Sunday Express, Richard Barkley, praised the film, saying that For Your Eyes Only \\"is one of the most exciting yet\\". Barkley describes Moore's Bond as having an \\"accustomed debonair calm and quiet authority\\". All told, Barkley thought \\"this Bond movie is smashing entertainment.\\" David Robinson, writing in The Times bemoaned the fact that the \\"dramatic bits between the set pieces don't count for much.\\" Like other critics at the time his praise was more directed towards the stunt crews; they were \\"better than ever in this one.\\" The film critic for the magazine Time Out was brief and pithy: \\"no plot and poor dialogue, and Moore really is old enough to be the uncle of those girls.\\" For the US press, Gary Arnold in The Washington Post thought the film was \\"undeniably easy on the eyes\\", and further added \\"maybe too easy to prevent the mind from wandering and the lids from drooping.\\" Arnold was also critical of the large set pieces, calling them \\"more ponderous than sensational\\" and that there was \\"no equivalent of the classic action highlights that can be recalled readily from \\"From Russia, With Love\\" or \\"You Only Live Twice\\" or \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" or \\"Moonraker.\\" This is a Bond waiting for something inspired to push it over the top.\\" The New York Times critic Vincent Canby said that \\"For Your Eyes Only is not the best of the series by a long shot\\" although he did say that the film is \\"slick entertainment\\" with a tone that is \\"consistently comic even when the material is not.\\" Jack Kroll in Newsweek dismissed the film, saying it was \\"an anthology of action episodes held together by the thinnest of plot lines\\", although he did concede that these set pieces are \\"terrific in their exhilaratingly absurd energy.\\" For Time magazine, Richard Corliss concentrated on the stunts, saying the team \\"have devised some splendid optional features for For Your Eyes Only\\" whilst also commenting on Roger Moore, saying that his \\"mannequin good looks and waxed-fruit insouciance\\" show him to be \\"the best- oiled cog in this perpetual motion machine.\\" Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail included it on his list of the year's worst films, calling it \\"repellant\\" and \\"ambitiously bad\\". French filmmaker Robert Bresson admired the film. \\"It filled me with wonder because of its cinematographic writing ... if I could have seen it twice in a row and again the next day, I would have done.\\"The interview may be seen on New Yorker Films' DVD release of Bresson's film L'Argent. Elsewhere Bresson said he also loved the film's ski chase. Reflective reviews Opinion on For Your Eyes Only has improved with the passing of time, though some reviews are still mixed to positive: , the film holds a 73% 'fresh' rating from Rotten Tomatoes, being ranked eleventh among the 24 Bond films.In 2008, the film was ranked ninth with 73%; ever since the list was posted, For Your Eyes Onlys score fell to 69%, falling behind the ones that stood from 12th to 10th ‚Äì You Only Live Twice (70%), Licence to Kill (71%) and The Living Daylights (73%)() Ian Nathan of Empire gives the film only two of a possible five stars, observing that the film \\"still ranks as one of the most forgettable Bonds on record.\\" In 2006, IGN chose For Your Eyes Only as the sixth best Bond film, claiming it is \\"a good old-fashioned espionage tale\\", a placement shared by Norman Wilner of MSN, who considered it \\"the one Moore film that seems to reach back to Connery's heyday\\", and Entertainment Weekly chose it as the tenth best in 2008, saying it was a \\"return to low-tech, low-key Bond [with] ... some of the best stunts since the early days\\". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of For Your Eyes Only and observed that the film is \\"admirable in intent\\" but that it \\"feels a little spare\\", largely because the plot has been \\"divested of the bells and whistles that hallmark the franchise\\". James Berardinelli wrote that the film was \\"a solid adventure, although it could have been better\\", while Danny Peary thought \\"There are exciting moments, but most of it is standard Bond fare,\\" going on to describe For Your Eyes Only as \\"an attempt to mix spectacle with [the] tough, believable storylines of early Bond films ... [it] is enjoyable while you're watching it. Afterward, it's one of the most forgettable of the Bond series.\\" Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, thought For Your Eyes Only was Roger Moore's best Bond film. Although Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly ranks Carole Bouquet playing Melina as the \\"worst babe\\" of the seven Roger Moore James Bond films, his colleague, Joshua Rich disagreed, putting her tenth in the overall 10 Best Bond Girls listing from the 21 films released up to that point. Entertainment Weekly also ranked Lynn- Holly Johnson as Bibi Dahl as ninth on their list of the 10 worst Bond girls from the 21 films that had been released. After 20 films had been released, IGN ranked Bouquet as fifth in their 'top 10 Bond Babes' list, and The Times thought she was sixth on their list of the Top 10 most fashionable Bond girls after 21 films had been released. Accolades The song \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" was nominated for a Best Original Song at the 39th Golden Globe Awards and Best Original Song at the 1981 Academy Awards, losing out at both ceremonies to \\"Arthur's Theme\\" from the film Arthur. However, the 1981 Academy Awards ceremony did see the presenting of the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to producer Albert R. Broccoli. The Writers Guild of America nominated the script by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum for Best Adapted Screenplay ‚Äì Comedy or Musical Picture. In 2004 the American Film Institute nominated the song \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" from the film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs. Adaptations alt=Two comic books covers, both titled \\"FOR YOUR EYES ONLY\\". The cover on the left shows a man with a pistol, with a blonde woman in front of him. In front of both of them a brunette woman holds a crossbow. The cover on the right shows the same man and brunette woman abseiling on a cliff, with two guns in the foreground pointing at them. As part of the merchandising of For Your Eyes Only, Marvel Comics published an adaptation of the movie as issue 19 of Marvel Comics Super Special; this was also repackaged as a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film. The first issue was released in October 1981 and was soon followed by the second issue in November of the same year. The adaptation was written by Larry Hama, pencilled by Howard Chaykin, inked by Vincent Colletta, and edited by Dennis O'Neil. It was the second film in the series to have a comic book tie-in, following a Dr. No comic in 1962. Marvel Comics would go on to publish an Octopussy comic book adaptation in 1983. In a 2015 interview with CBC Radio One Lee Demarbre and Ian Driscoll announced their plans to make a Canadian film adaptation of For Your Eyes Only set in Ottawa, which they intend to be the first installment in a four-film series. The production of a film is possible because Canada enforces the Berne Convention and the Copyright Act automatically releasing an author's entire collected works to the public domain 50 years after their death, causing Ian Fleming's works to enter the public domain in Canada in 2014. Demarbre and Driscoll expressed interest in casting Ryan Reynolds as James Bond; Jessica Par√© as Judy Havelock; Donald Sutherland, Christopher Plummer, and Michael Ironside as supporting characters; and the Dead Obies as the performers of the title song. Although a film adaptation will not be releasable in the United States and Europe due to differing copyright law they believed it could recoup its profits through a release in Asia, including China.

It is based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. Starring Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Joseph Wiseman, and Jack Lord, it is the first film in the James Bond series, and was adapted by Richard Maibaum, Johanna Harwood, and Berkely Mather. The film was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, a partnership that continued until 1975. In the film, James Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from Cape Canaveral with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels. Casino Royale was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which was not introduced until the 1961 novel Thunderball. Produced on a low budget, Dr. No was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments. Dr. No also launched a genre of \\"secret agent\\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a comic book adaptation and soundtrack album as part of its promotion and marketing. Many aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in Dr. No: the film begins with an introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by Maurice Binder. It also established the iconic \\"James Bond\\" theme music. Production designer Ken Adam established an elaborate visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the film series.  Plot  John Strangways, an MI6 Station Chief based in Jamaica, is murdered by a trio of assassins, along with his secretary, before his home is ransacked. When news reaches M, the head of MI6, that Strangways has vanished, he assigns agent James Bond to investigate the matter and determine if it is related to Strangways' decision to co-operate on a CIA case involving the disruption of rocket launches from Cape Canaveral by radio jamming. When Bond arrives in Jamaica, he is immediately accosted by a man claiming to be a chauffeur sent to collect him, but who is really an enemy agent sent to kill him. Before Bond can interrogate him, following a struggle, the agent kills himself with a cyanide capsule. After visiting Strangways' house, Bond confronts a boatman that Strangways was acquainted with. The boatman, named Quarrel, reveals that he is aiding the CIA and introduces Bond to CIA agent Felix Leiter, who is also investigating Strangways' disappearance. Bond inquires about the CIA case and learns from Felix that the CIA traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica and that Strangways was helping to pinpoint its exact origins. Quarrel reveals that before Strangways disappeared, the pair collected mineral samples from an island called Crab Key. Upon finding a receipt from a local geologist, Professor R.J. Dent, Bond makes inquires with him about the samples and Crab Key but is suspicious of his answers when he claims the samples checked out as normal. Following the meeting, Dent travels to Crab Key to meet its reclusive owner, whom he works for, to inform him of Bond's visit. Under strict instructions, Dent attempts to have Bond killed with a tarantula. However, Bond kills the spider and then sets a trap for Dent. When the geologist arrives, Bond holds him at gunpoint, revealing that he believed Dent was asked to check Strangways' samples to see if they were radioactive, before killing him. After checking Quarrel's boat with a Geiger counter, Bond determines that he must have suspected that the radio jamming was coming from Crab Key, and so convinces Quarrel to take him out there. The following day, after arriving, Bond meets with Honey Ryder while she is collecting shells. Without warning, Bond is forced to take Ryder with him and escape with Quarrel into the swamp when armed men suddenly show up. When nightfall arrives, the group encounter a flamethrower-equipped tank that locals claimed was a \\"dragon\\", which incinerates Quarrel. In the chaos, Bond and Ryder are kidnapped and taken to a hidden base, whereupon they are swiftly put into decontamination after they learn the swamp was contaminated with radiation. After being led to some private quarters set up for them, the pair are rendered unconscious with drugged coffee. Upon awakening, the pair are escorted to dine with the base's owner Dr. No - a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has prosthetic metal hands due to radiation exposure. While dining with him, Bond learns that Dr. No was a former member of a Chinese crime Tong, until he stole $10 million in gold, and now works as an operative of the secret organisation SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counter- intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion). Bond learns that the radio jamming being conducted by Dr. No is being planned to disrupt the Project Mercury space launch at Cape Canaveral using a radio beam, in hopes of creating a war between the Americans and Russians. When Bond refuses to join SPECTRE, Dr. No has Ryder taken away and Bond imprisoned. However, Bond manages to escape his cell through an air vent and disguises himself as a worker, before infiltrating the base's control centre. Bond discovers that the radio beam being prepared to disrupt the launch is powered by a nuclear pool reactor, and quickly overloads it as the launch commences. Dr. No attempts to stop him but is knocked into the reactor pool and killed. As the base's personnel evacuate, Bond finds and frees Ryder before the two escape the island by boat, moments before the base is destroyed. Felix eventually finds the pair adrift at sea, after their boat runs out of fuel, and has them towed to safety by a Royal Navy ship. However, as Ryder shares a kiss with him, Bond lets go of the tow rope in order to embrace her.

Production  When Harry Saltzman gained the rights for the novel, he initially did not go through with the project. Instead, Albert R. \\"Cubby\\" Broccoli wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \\"too British\\" or \\"too blatantly sexual\\". Eventually the two received authorisation from United Artists to produce Dr. No, to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: Danjaq, which was to hold the rights to the films, and Eon Productions, which was to produce them. The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of The Man with the Golden Gun led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists. Initially Broccoli and Saltzman had wanted to produce the eighth Bond novel, 1961's Thunderball, as the first film, but there was an ongoing legal dispute between the screenplay's co-author, Kevin McClory and Ian Fleming. As a result, Broccoli and Saltzman chose Dr. No: the timing was apposite, with claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. The producers offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, but all of them turned it down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \\"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm.\\" The producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 to create the climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As a result of the low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only ¬£745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying that he did not want to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: > The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was > ¬£14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were > filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was > a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided > to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we > didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage > they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and > put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I > didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed > contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to > have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, > which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National > Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I > painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for > publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was > on display.  Writing  Broccoli had originally hired Richard Maibaum and his friend Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey. Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.Johanna Harwood Interview Movie Classics # 4 Solo Publishing 2012 During the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; Dr. No has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a giant squid, and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a centipede; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a bauxite mine instead of a guano quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt NASA space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating reactor coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book. Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character. Sometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \\"escape\\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.  Casting  = James Bond = While producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who played the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale. There are several apocryphal stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted. Reportedly, Fleming favoured actor Richard Todd. In his autobiography When the Snow Melts, Cubby Broccoli said Roger Moore had been considered, but had been thought \\"too young, perhaps a shade too pretty.\\" In his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, Moore says he was never approached to play the role of Bond until 1973, for Live and Let Die. Moore appeared as Simon Templar on the television series The Saint, airing in the United Kingdom for the first time on 4 October 1962, only one day before the premiere of Dr. No. Ultimately, the producers turned to 32 year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest set up to \\"find James Bond\\". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable to cope with the role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery \\"put on an act and it paid off\\" as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer Raymond Benson, Young educated the actor \\"in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool\\".. In . = Secondary cast = For the first Bond girl Honey Ryder, Julie Christie was considered, but discarded as the producers felt she was not voluptuous enough. Just two weeks before filming began, Ursula Andress was chosen to play Honey after the producers saw a picture of her taken by Andress' then-husband John Derek. To appear more convincing as a Jamaican, Andress had a tan painted on her and ultimately had her lines redubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl due to Andress' heavy Swiss-German accent. For Bond's antagonist Dr. No, Ian Fleming wanted his friend No√´l Coward, and Coward answered the invitation with \\"No! No! No!\\" Fleming considered that his step-cousin, Christopher Lee, would be good for the role of Dr. No, although, by the time Fleming told the producers, they had already chosen Joseph Wiseman for the part. Harry Saltzman picked Wiseman because of his performance in the 1951 film Detective Story, and the actor had special make-up applied to evoke No's Chinese heritage. Swedish actor Max von Sydow was also offered the role as Dr. No, but decided to turn it down. He would later appear as Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the unofficial James Bond film Never Say Never Again. The role as the first Felix Leiter was given to Jack Lord. This is Bond and Leiter's first time meeting each other on film and Leiter does not appear in the novel. Leiter returns for many of Bond's future adventures and in the 2006 reboot of the film series, Casino Royale, Leiter and Bond are seen meeting one another again for the first time. This was Lord's only appearance as Leiter, as he asked for more money and a better billing to return as Leiter in Goldfinger and was subsequently replaced. The cast also included a number of actors who were to become stalwarts of the future films, including Bernard Lee, who played Bond's superior M for another ten films, and Lois Maxwell, who played M's secretary Moneypenny in fourteen instalments of the series. Lee was chosen because of being a \\"prototypical father figure\\", and Maxwell after Fleming thought she was the perfect fit for his description of the character. Maxwell was initially offered a choice between the roles of Moneypenny or Sylvia Trench and opted for Moneypenny as she thought the Trench role, which included appearing in immodest dress, was too sexual. Eunice Gayson was cast as Sylvia Trench and it was planned that she would be a recurring girlfriend for Bond throughout six films, although she appeared only in Dr. No and From Russia with Love. She had been given the part by director Terence Young, who had worked with her in Zarak and invited Gayson saying \\"You always bring me luck in my films\\", although she was also cast due to her voluptuous figure. One role which was not given to a future regular was that of Major Boothroyd, the head of Q-Branch, which was given to Peter Burton. Burton was unavailable for the subsequent film, From Russia with Love, and the role was taken by Desmond Llewelyn. Anthony Dawson, who played Professor Dent, met director Terence Young when he was working as a stage actor in London, but by the time of the film's shooting Dawson was working as a pilot and crop duster in Jamaica. Dawson also portrayed Ernst Stavro Blofeld, head of SPECTRE, in From Russia with Love and Thunderball, although his face was never seen and his voice was redubbed by Austrian actor Eric Pohlmann. Zena Marshall, who played Miss Taro, was mostly attracted by the humorous elements of the script, and described her role as \\"this attractive little siren, and at the same time I was the spy, a bad woman\\", who Young asked to play \\"not as Chinese, but a Mid-Atlantic woman who men dream about but is not real\\". The role of Taro was previously rejected by Marguerite LeWars, the Miss Jamaica 1961 who worked at the Kingston airport, as it required being \\"wrapped in a towel, lying in a bed, kissing a strange man\\".  Filming  Dr. No's lair was this bauxite terminal near Oracabessa, Jamaica Dr. No is set in London, Jamaica and Crab Key, a fictional island off Jamaica. Filming began on location in Jamaica on 16 January 1962. The primary scenes there were the exterior shots of Crab Key and Kingston, where an uncredited Syd Cain acted as art director and also designed the Dragon Tank. Shooting took place a few yards from Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the author regularly visited the filming with friends. Location filming was largely in Oracabessa, with additional scenes on the Palisadoes strip and Port Royal in St Andrew. On 21 February, production left Jamaica with footage still unfilmed due to a change of weather. Five days later, filming began at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, England with sets designed by Ken Adam, which included Dr. No's base, the ventilation duct and the interior of the British Secret Service headquarters. The studio was used on the majority of later Bond films. Adam's initial budget for the entire film was just ¬£14,500 (¬£ in ), but the producers were convinced to give him an extra ¬£6,000 out of their own finances. After 58 days of filming, principal photography completed on 30 March 1962. The scene where a tarantula walks over Bond was initially shot by pinning a bed to the wall and placing Sean Connery over it, with a protective glass between him and the spider. Director Young did not like the final results, so the scenes were interlaced with new footage featuring the tarantula over stuntman Bob Simmons. Simmons, who was uncredited for the film, described the scene as the most frightening stunt he had ever performed. The book features a scene where Honey Ryder is tortured by being tied to the ground along with crabs, but since the crabs were sent frozen from the Caribbean, they did not move much during filming, so the scene was altered to have Honey slowly drowning. Simmons also served as the film's fight choreographer, employing a rough fighting style. The noted violence of Dr. No, which also included Bond shooting Dent in cold blood, caused producers to make adaptations to get an \\"A\\" rating ‚Äì allowing minors to enter accompanied by an adult ‚Äì from the British Board of Film Classification. When he is about to have dinner with Dr. No, Bond is amazed to see Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington. The painting had been stolen from the National Gallery by a 60-year-old amateur thief in London just before filming began. Ken Adam had contacted the National Gallery in London to obtain a slide of the picture, painting the copy over the course of the weekend, prior to filming commencing on the Monday. Editor Peter R. Hunt used an innovative editing technique, with extensive use of quick cuts, and employing fast motion and exaggerated sound effects on the action scenes. Hunt said his intention was to \\"move fast and push it along the whole time, while giving it a certain style\\", and added that the fast pacing would help audiences not notice any writing problems. As title artist Maurice Binder was creating the credits, he had an idea for the introduction that appeared in all subsequent Bond films, the James Bond gun barrel sequence. It was filmed in sepia by putting a pinhole camera inside an .38 calibre gun barrel, with Bob Simmons playing Bond. Binder also designed a highly stylised main title sequence, a theme that has been repeated in the subsequent Eon-produced Bond films. Binder's budget for the title sequence was ¬£2,000 (¬£ in ).  Soundtrack  Monty Norman was invited to write the soundtrack because Broccoli liked his work on the 1961 theatre production Belle, a musical about murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen. Norman was busy with musicals, and only agreed to do the music for Dr. No after Saltzman allowed him to travel along with the crew to Jamaica. The most famous composition in the soundtrack is the \\"James Bond Theme\\", which is heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits, and was written by Norman based on a previous composition of his. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the Bond theme but was uncredited‚Äîexcept for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. It has occasionally been suggested that Barry, not Norman, composed the \\"James Bond Theme\\". This argument has been the subject of two court cases, the most recent in 2001, which found in favour of Norman. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as \\"bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll ... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes.\\" The music for the opening scene is a calypso version of the nursery rhyme \\"Three Blind Mice,\\" with new lyrics to reflect the intentions of the three assassins hired by Dr. No. Other notable songs in the film are the song \\"Jump Up,\\" played in the background, and the traditional Jamaican calypso \\"Under the Mango Tree,\\" famously sung by Diana Coupland (then Norman's wife), the singing voice of Honey Ryder, as she walked out of the ocean on Crab Key. Byron Lee & the Dragonaires appeared in the film and performed some of the music on the later soundtrack album. Lee and other Jamaican musicians who appear in the soundtrack, including Ernest Ranglin and Carlos Malcolm, were introduced to Norman by Chris Blackwell, the owner of then-small label Island Records who worked in the film as a location scout. The original soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records in 1963 as well as several cover versions of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" on Columbia Records. A single of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" entered the UK Singles Chart in 1962, reaching a peak position of number thirteen during an eleven-week spell in the charts. Ranglin, who had acted as arranger on several tracks, and Malcolm sued Eon for unpaid fees, both settling out of court; Malcolm and his band performed a year later at the film's premiere in Kingston.  Release and reception   Promotion  As soon as late 1961, United Artists started a marketing campaign to make James Bond a well-known name in North America. Newspapers received a box set of Bond's books, as well as a booklet detailing the Bond character and a picture of Ursula Andress. Eon and United Artists made licensing deals revolving around the character's tastes, having merchandising tie-ins with drink, tobacco, men's clothing and car companies. The campaign also focused on Ian Fleming's name due to the minor success of the books. After Dr. No had a successful run in Europe, Sean Connery and Terence Young did a cross-country tour of the US in March 1963, which featured screening previews for the film and press conferences. It culminated in a well-publicised premiere in Kingston, where most of the film is set. Some of the campaign emphasised the sex appeal of the film, with the poster artwork, by Mitchell Hooks, depicting Sean Connery and four scantily clad women. The campaign also included the 007 logo designed by Joseph Caroff with a pistol as part of the seven. Dr. No had its worldwide premiere at the London Pavilion, on 5 October 1962, expanding to the rest of the United Kingdom three days later. The North American premiere on 8 May 1963 was more low-profile, with 450 cinemas in Midwest and Southwest regions. On 29 May it opened in both Los Angeles and New York City ‚Äì in the former as a double-bill with The Young and the Brave and the latter in United Artists' \\"Premiere Showcase\\" treatment, screening in 84 screens across the city to avoid the costly Broadway cinemas.  Critical response  Upon release, Dr. No received a mixed critical reception. Time called Bond a \\"blithering bounder\\" and \\"a great big hairy marshmallow\\" who \\"almost always manages to seem slightly silly\\". Stanley Kauffmann in The New Republic said that he felt the film \\"never decides whether it is suspense or suspense- spoof.\\" He also did not like Connery, or the Fleming novels. The Vatican condemned Dr. No describing it as \\"a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex\\", whilst the Kremlin said that Bond was the personification of capitalist evil ‚Äì both controversies helped increase public awareness of the film and greater cinema attendance. However Leonard Mosely in The Daily Express said that \\"Dr No is fun all the way, and even the sex is harmless\\", whilst Penelope Gilliatt in The Observer said it was \\"full of submerged self- parody\\". The Guardians critic called Dr. No \\"crisp and well-tailored\\" and \\"a neat and gripping thriller.\\" In the years that followed its release, it became more popular. Writing in 1986, Danny Peary described Dr. No as a \\"cleverly conceived adaption of Ian Fleming's enjoyable spy thriller ... Picture has sex, violence, wit, terrific action sequences, and colorful atmosphere ... Connery, Andress, and Wiseman all give memorable performances. There's a slow stretch in the middle and Dr. No could use a decent henchman, but otherwise, the film works marvelously.\\" Describing Dr. No as \\"a different type of film\\", Peary notes that \\"Looking back, one can understand why it caused so much excitement.\\" In 1999, it was ranked 41 on the BFI top 100 British films list compiled by the British Film Institute. The 2005 American Film Institute's '100 Years' series also recognised the character of James Bond himself in the film as the third greatest film hero. He was also placed at number eleven on a similar list by Empire. Premiere also listed Bond as the fifth greatest movie character of all time. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Dr. No has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating of 95% based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 9.23/10. The sites critical consensus reads: \\"Featuring plenty of the humor, action, and escapist thrills the series would be known for, Dr. No kicks off the Bond franchise in style.\\"  Popular reaction  In the United Kingdom, playing in 168 cinemas, Dr. No grossed $840,000 in just two weeks and wound up being the fifth most popular movie of the year there. The box office results in mainland Europe were also positive. The film ended up grossing $6 million, making it a financial success compared to its $1 million budget. The original North American gross rental was $2 million, increasing to $6 million after its first reissue in 1965, as a double feature with From Russia with Love. The following reissue was in 1966 paired with Goldfinger, to compensate the fact that the next Bond movie would only come out in the following year. The total gross of Dr. No ended up being $59.6 million worldwide, IGN listed it as sixth-best Bond film ever, Entertainment Weekly put it at seventh among Bond films, and Norman Wilner of MSN as twelfth best. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 56 reviews and judged 95% of the reviews as positive. President John F. Kennedy was a fan of Ian Fleming's novels and requested a private showing of Dr. No in the White House. In 2003, the scene of Andress emerging from the water in a bikini topped Channel 4's list of one hundred sexiest scenes of film history. The bikini was sold in 2001 at an auction for $61,500. Entertainment Weekly and IGN ranked her first in a top ten \\"Bond babes\\" list.  The introduction of James Bond  A seminal moment in cinema. Sean Connery introduces alt=Video clip from the film, set in a casino. A woman at the table, wearing a red dress, asks \\"Mister ...?\\" and a man in a suit answers \\"Bond, James Bond\\" as he lights his cigarette. The character James Bond was introduced towards, but not at, the beginning of the film in a \\"now-famous nightclub sequence featuring Sylvia Trench\\", to whom he makes his \\"immortal introduction\\". The introduction to the character in Le Cercle at Les Ambassadeurs, an upmarket gambling club, is derived from Bond's introduction in the first novel, Casino Royale, which Fleming had used because \\"skill at gambling and knowledge of how to behave in a casino were seen ... as attributes of a gentleman\\". After losing a hand of Chemin de Fer to Bond, Trench asks his name. There is the \\"most important gesture [in] ... the way he lights his cigarette before giving her the satisfaction of an answer. 'Bond, James Bond'.\\" Once Connery says his line, Monty Norman's Bond theme plays \\"and creates an indelible link between music and character.\\" In the short scene introducing Bond, there are portrayed \\"qualities of strength, action, reaction, violence ‚Äì and this elegant, slightly brutal gambler with the quizzical sneer we see before us who answers a woman when he's good and ready.\\" Raymond Benson, author of the continuation Bond novels, has stated that as the music fades up on the scene, \\"we have ourselves a piece of classic cinema\\". Following the release of Dr. No, the quote \\"Bond ... James Bond\\", became a catch phrase that entered the lexicon of Western popular culture: writers Cork and Scivally said of the introduction in Dr. No that the \\"signature introduction would become the most famous and loved film line ever\\". In 2001 it was voted as the \\"best-loved one-liner in cinema\\" by British cinema goers. In 2005, it was honoured as the 22nd greatest quotation in cinema history by the American Film Institute as part of their 100 Years Series.  Comic book adaptation  Around the time of Dr. Nos release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in the United Kingdom as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high- profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).  Legacy  Dr. No was the first of 25 James Bond films produced by Eon, which have grossed just over $5 billion in box office returns alone, making the series one of the highest-grossing ever. It is estimated that since Dr. No, a quarter of the world's population have seen at least one Bond film. Dr. No also launched a successful genre of \\"secret agent\\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The UK Film Distributors' Association have stated that the importance of Dr. No to the British film industry cannot be overstated, as it, and the subsequent Bond series of films, \\"form the backbone of the industry\\". Dr. No ‚Äì and the Bond films in general ‚Äì also inspired television output, with the NBC series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which was described as the \\"first network television imitation\\" of Bond. The style of the Bond films, largely derived from production designer Ken Adam, is one of the hallmarks of the Bond film series, and the effect of his work on Dr. No's lair can be seen in another film he worked on, Dr. Strangelove. As the first film in the series, a number of the elements of Dr. No were contributors to subsequent films, including Monty Norman's \\"James Bond Theme\\" and Maurice Binder's gun barrel sequence, variants of which all appeared in subsequent films. These conventions were also lampooned in spoof films, such as the Austin Powers series. The first spoof films happened relatively soon after Dr. No, with the 1964 film Carry On Spying showing the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included Charlie Bind (Charles Hawtrey) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor). Sales of Fleming's novels rose sharply after the release of Dr. No and the subsequent films. In the seven months after Dr. No was released, 1.5 million copies of the novel were sold. Worldwide sales of all the Bond books rose throughout the 1960s as Dr. No and the subsequent films ‚Äì From Russia with Love and Goldfinger ‚Äì were released: in 1961 500,000 books had been sold, which rose to six million in 1964 and seven million in 1965. Between the years 1962 to 1967, a total of nearly 22.8 million Bond novels were sold. The film influenced ladies' fashion, with the bikini worn by Ursula Andress proving to be a huge hit: \\"not only sent sales of two-piece swimwear skyrocketing, it also made Andress an international celebrity\\". Andress herself acknowledged that the \\"bikini made me into a success. As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent\\". It has been claimed that the use of the swimwear in Dr. No led to \\"the biggest impact on the history of the bikini\\".  Global James Bond Day  On 5 October 2012, fifty years after the release of the film, Eon Productions celebrated \\"Global James Bond Day\\", a series of events around the world. Events included a film festival of showings of the James Bond films, a documentary of the series, an online auction for charity and further events at the Museum of Modern Art and the Toronto International Film Festival. A concert of various music was held in Los Angeles in conjunction with the New York event. The day also saw the release of \\"Skyfall\\", the theme song of the 2012 James Bond film of the same name; the song was released at 0:07 BST.

The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, it co-stars Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Corinne Cl√©ry, and Richard Kiel. Bond investigates the theft of a Space Shuttle, leading him to Hugo Drax, the owner of the Shuttle's manufacturing firm. Along with space scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead, Bond follows the trail from California to Venice, Rio de Janeiro, the Amazon rainforest, and finally into outer space to prevent a plot to wipe out the world population and to recreate humanity with a master race. The story was intended by author Ian Fleming to become a film even before he completed the novel in 1954; he based it on a screenplay manuscript he had devised earlier. The film's producers had originally intended to make For Your Eyes Only, but chose Moonraker owing to the rise of the science fiction genre in the wake of the Star Wars phenomenon. Budgetary issues led to the film being shot primarily in France; other locations included Italy, Brazil, Guatemala and the United States. The soundstages of Pinewood Studios in England, traditionally used for the series, were only used by the special effects team. Moonraker had a high production cost of $34 million, more than twice as much as The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), and it received mixed reviews. However, the film's visuals were praised, with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series at the time with $210,300,000 worldwide, a record that stood until 1995's GoldenEye. Plot A Drax Industries Moonraker (a VTHL spaceplane based on the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter) on loan to the United Kingdom is hijacked in midair while on a Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, which is destroyed, but no wreckage of the Shuttle is found. M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is attacked and pushed out of an airplane by the mercenary assassin Jaws (whom he previously met in The Spy Who Loved Me). He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent. At the Drax Industries spaceplane-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and survives an assassination attempt while inside a centrifuge chamber. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, sleeps with Bond and then helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs. Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory. Then he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to investigate, and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to plants and animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a CIA agent spying on Drax and sleeps with her. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretense of being on leave. Bond survives attacks by Jaws, whom Drax previously hired as Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival and on the Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, a young woman, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid indigenous to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River and comes under attack from Drax's forces, before eventually locating his base. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole back the loaned Shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead are encaged by Jaws in a meeting room under the launch platform, and narrowly escape being burned alive by the exhausts of Moonraker 5, which is carrying Drax, and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with a huge, city-like space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device. Bond and Goodhead disable the radar jamming cloaking device; the United States sends a platoon of Marines aboard another shuttle to intercept the now-visible space station. Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would dispense the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendants would be the seed for a \\"new master race\\". Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including him and Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines (attacking on MMUs). Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and ejects Drax into space. Bond and Goodhead use Drax's laser-armed Moonraker 5 to destroy the three launched globes and return to Earth. It is revealed that Jaws and Dolly, who ejected themselves in one of Drax's escape pods, after toasting with a bottle of champagne, are being recovered by the Marines. Bond's superiors get a video feed of Moonraker 5 and are bemused to see Bond and Goodhead making love in zero gravity.

Production The end credits for the previous Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me, said, \\"James Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only\\"; however, the producers chose the novel Moonraker as the basis for the next film, following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film Star Wars. For Your Eyes Only was subsequently delayed and ended up following Moonraker in 1981. Script Ian Fleming had originally intended the novel, published in 1955, to be made into a film even before he began writing it. A part of the novel was thus based on an original idea for a screenplay which had been on his mind for years. In 1955, American actor John Payne offered $1,000 for a nine-month option to Moonraker, plus $10,000 if production eventually took off. The negotiations broke up the following year due to disagreements regarding Payne's ownership of the other Bond novels. Fleming eventually settled with Rank Organisation, a British company who owned Pinewood Studios. Rank wound up not developing the film, even after Fleming contributed his own script trying to push production forward, and Fleming purchased the rights back in 1959. Moonraker ended up being the last James Bond novel to receive a screen adaptation. However, as with several previous Bond films, the story from Fleming's novel is almost entirely dispensed with, and little more than the idea of Hugo Drax as an industrialist who makes rockets was used in the film. Drax has a plan for a master race in the film, but in the novel actually had been a Nazi (unbeknownst to the English). The dramatic scene of Bond and his female companion being trapped in an exhaust duct under a rocket where they are nearly burned to death also appears in the film. Otherwise the film is more in keeping with contemporary trends in science fiction. The 2002 Bond film Die Another Day makes further use of some ideas and character names from the novel. Tom Mankiewicz wrote a short outline for Moonraker that was mostly discarded. According to Mankiewicz, footage shot at Drax's lairs was considerably more detailed than the edited result in the final version. The crew had shot a scene with Drax meeting his co-financiers in his jungle lair and they used the same chamber room below the space shuttle launch pad from which Bond and Goodhead eventually escape. This scene was shot, but later cut. Another scene involving Bond and Goodhead in a meditation room aboard Drax's space station was shot but never used in the final film. However, press stills were released of the scene, which was featured on Topps trading cards in 1979, as was a cinema trailer which featured a close-up of Jaws' reaction after Bond punches him in the face aboard the space station, neither of which appeared in the complete film. Some scenes from Mankiewicz's script were used in subsequent films, including the Acrostar Jet sequence, used in the pre-credit sequence for Octopussy, and the Eiffel Tower scene in A View to a Kill. In 1978 Steven Spielberg offered to direct the film after the release of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but Albert R. Broccoli turned him down. In March 2004 rumours surfaced about a lost 1956 version of Moonraker by Orson Welles, and a James Bond web site repeated it on April Fool's Day in 2004 as a hoax. Supposedly, this recently discovered lost film consisted of 40 minutes of raw footage with Dirk Bogarde as Bond, Welles as Drax, and Peter Lorre as Drax's henchman. =Novelization= The screenplay of Moonraker differed so much from Ian Fleming's novel that Eon Productions authorised the film's screenwriter Christopher Wood to write a novelisation, his second (after James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me). It was named James Bond and Moonraker to avoid confusion with Fleming's original novel Moonraker. It was published in 1979, with the film's release. Casting The height difference between the giant Jaws and his diminutive girlfriend Dolly Initially, the chief villain, Hugo Drax, was to be played by British actor James Mason, but once the decision was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965‚Äì1979 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cl√©ry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with qualifying criteria of the agreement. Stewart Granger and Louis Jourdan were considered also for the role of Drax. Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given the seat next to Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist. Jaclyn Smith was originally offered the role of Holly Goodhead but had to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with Charlie's Angels. Drax's henchman Chang was played by Japanese aikido instructor Toshiro Suga; he was recommended for the role by executive producer Michael G. Wilson, who was one of his pupils. Wilson, continuing a tradition he started in the film Goldfinger, has a small cameo role in Moonraker: he appears twice, first as a tourist outside the Venini Glass shop and museum in Venice, then at the end of the film as a technician in the US Navy control room. The Jaws character, played by Richard Kiel, makes a return, although in Moonraker the role is played more for comedic effect than in The Spy Who Loved Me. Jaws was intended to be a villain against Bond to the bitter end, but director Lewis Gilbert stated on the DVD documentary that he received so much fan mail from small children saying \\"Why can't Jaws be a goodie not a baddie\\", that as a result he was persuaded to gradually transform Jaws into Bond's ally by the end of the film. Diminutive French actress Blanche Ravalec, who had recently begun her career with minor roles in French films such as Michel Lang's Holiday Hotel (1978) and Claude Sautet's A Simple Story (1978), was cast as the bespectacled Dolly, the girlfriend of Jaws. Originally, the producers were dubious about whether the audience would accept the height difference between them, and only made their decision once they were informed by Richard Kiel that his real-life wife was of the same height. Lois Maxwell's 22-year-old daughter, Melinda Maxwell, was also cast as one of the \\"perfect\\" human specimens from Drax's master race. Filming Production began on 14 August 1978. The main shooting was switched from the usual 007 Stage at the Pinewood Studios to France, due to high taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in √âpinay and Boulogne-Billancourt. The 220 technicians used 100 tonnes of metal, two tonnes of nails and 10,000 board feet of wood to build the three-story space station set at √âpinay Studios. The elaborate space set for Moonraker holds the world record for having the largest number of zero gravity wires in one scene. The Venetian glass museum and fight between Bond and Chang was shot at Boulogne Studios in a building which had once been a World War II Luftwaffe aircraft factory during Germany's occupation of France. The scene in the Venice glass museum and warehouse holds the record for the largest amount of break-away sugar glass used in a single scene. Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte was used for Drax's chateau in the film. An extensive aerial view of the site was witnessed by helicopter in the early stages of the film by Bond and Dufour arriving. Drax's mansion, set in California, was actually filmed at the Ch√¢teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte, about southeast of Paris, for the exteriors and Grand Salon. The remaining interiors, including some of the scenes with Corinne Defour and the drawing room, were filmed at the Ch√¢teau de Guermantes. Much of the film was shot in the cities of London, Paris, Venice, Palmdale, California, Port St. Lucie, Florida, and Rio de Janeiro. The production team had considered India and Nepal as locations, but after scouting trips these were rejected as impractical to work into the script, particularly considering the time constraints. They decided on Rio de Janeiro relatively early on, a city that producer Albert R. Broccoli had visited on holiday, and a team was sent there in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the Carnival, which featured in the film. Stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death during the filming of the cable car sequence at Sugarloaf Mountain. At the Rio de Janeiro location, many months later, Roger Moore arrived several days later than scheduled for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. Upon arrival, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane for hair and make-up work before reboarding the plane to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the midair cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws, stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death. For the scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures. Iguazu Falls, in the south of Brazil, was used in the film, although as Q notes, the falls were supposedly somewhere in the upper basin of the Amazon River. The second unit had originally planned on sending an actual boat over the falls. However, on attempting to release it, the boat became firmly embedded on rocks near the edge. Despite a dangerous attempt by helicopter and rope ladder to retrieve it, the plan had to be abandoned, forcing the second unit to use a miniature at Pinewood instead. The exterior of Drax's pyramid headquarters in the Amazon rain forest near the falls was actually filmed at the Tikal Mayan ruins in Guatemala. The interior of the pyramid, however, was designed by Ken Adam at a French studio, in which he purposefully used a shiny coating to make the walls look plastic and false. All of the space centre scenes were shot at the Vehicle Assembly Building of the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, although some of the earlier scenes of the Moonraker assembly plant had been filmed on location at the Rockwell International manufacturing plant in Palmdale, California. The climax of the film with the laser battle on Drax's space station. Moonraker holds the world record for the largest number of zero gravity wires in one scene. The early scene in which Jaws pushes Bond out of the aircraft without a parachute took weeks of planning and preparation. The skydiving sequence was coordinated by Don Calvedt under the supervision of second unit director John Glen and was shot above Lake Berryessa in northern California. As Calvedt and skydiving champion B.J. Worth developed the equipment for the scene, which included a parachute pack that could be concealed beneath the suit to give the impression of the missing parachute, and equipment to prevent the freefalling cameraman from suffering whiplash while opening his parachute, they brought in stuntman Jake Lombard to test it all. Lombard eventually played Bond in the scene, with Worth as the pilot from whom Bond takes a parachute, and Ron Luginbill as Jaws. Both Lombard and Worth became regular members of the stunt team for aerial sequences in later Bond films. When the stuntmen opened their parachutes at the end of every shoot, custom-sewn velcro costume seams separated to allow the hidden parachutes to open. The skydiver cinematographer used a lightweight Panavision experimental plastic anamorphic lens, bought from an old pawn shop in Paris, which he had adapted, and attached to his helmet to shoot the entire sequence. The scene took a total of 88 skydives by the stuntmen to be completed. The only scenes shot in studio were close-ups of Roger Moore and Richard Kiel. Since NASA's Space Shuttle program had not been launched, Derek Meddings and his miniatures team had to create the rocket launch footage without any reference. Shuttle models attached to bottle rockets and signal flares were used for take-off, and the smoke trail was created with salt that fell from the models. The space scenes were done by rewinding the camera after an element was shot, enabling other elements to be superimposed in the film stock, with the space battle needing up to forty rewinds to incorporate everything. The climactic scenes of the space station disintegrating were created by Meddings and other members of the special effects team shooting the miniature model with shotguns. For the scene involving the opening of the musical electronic laboratory door lock in Venice, producer Albert R. Broccoli requested special permission from director Steven Spielberg to use the five-note melody from Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). In 1985, Broccoli returned the favour by fulfilling Spielberg's request to use the James Bond theme music for a scene in his film, The Goonies (1985). As James Bond is arriving at the scene of the pheasant shoot, a trumpet is sounded playing the first three brass notes from Also sprach Zarathustra, referencing the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Music Moonraker was the third of three Bond films for which the theme song was performed by Shirley Bassey (following Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever). Frank Sinatra was originally considered for the vocals, and Kate Bush was asked, but she declined. Johnny Mathis was approached and offered the opportunity. However, Mathis‚Äîdespite having started recording with Barry‚Äîwas unable to complete the project, leaving producers to offer the song to Bassey just weeks before the premiere date in England. Bassey made the recordings with very short notice and as a result, she never regarded the song 'as her own' as she had never had the chance to perform it in full or promote it first. The film uses two versions of the title theme song, a ballad version heard over the main titles, and a disco version over the closing titles. The song made little impact on the charts, reaching #159, partly attributed to Bassey's failure to promote the single, given the last-minute decision to quickly record it to meet the schedule. In 2005, Bassey sang the song for the first time outside James Bond on stage as part of a medley of her three Bond title songs. An instrumental strings version of the title theme was used in 2007 tourism commercials for the Dominican Republic. The soundtrack of Moonraker was composed by John Barry and recorded in Paris, again, as with production, marking a turning point away from the prior studio, CTS Studios in London. The score also marked a turning point in John Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores in favor of slow, rich string passages ‚Äì a trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as Out of Africa and Somewhere in Time. For Moonraker, for the first time since Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Barry used a piece of music called \\"007\\" (on track 7), and \\"Bond smells a rat\\", the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry and introduced in From Russia with Love during Bond's escape with the Lektor; some classical music pieces were also included in the film. For the scene where Bond visits Drax in his chateau, Drax plays Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Prelude no. 15 in D-flat major (op. 28), \\"Raindrop\\", on his grand piano (although he plays in the key of D major). Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka by Johann Strauss II was used during the hovercraft scene on the Piazza San Marco in Venice, and Tchaikovsky's \\"Romeo and Juliet Overture\\" plays when Jaws meets Dolly following his accident. Other passages pay homage to earlier films, including Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra (op. 30), associated with 2001: A Space Odyssey, with the hunting horn playing its distinctive first three notes, Elmer Bernstein's theme from The Magnificent Seven when Bond appears on horseback in gaucho clothing at MI6 headquarters in Brazil, and the alien-contacting theme from Close Encounters of the Third Kind as the key-code for a security door as mentioned previously. The Italian aria \\"Vesti la giubba\\" from Ruggero Leoncavallo's opera I Pagliacci, was sung in Venice before one of the henchmen falls to his death from a building, landing inside a piano. Release and reception Moonraker premiered on 26 June 1979, in the Odeon Leicester Square, United Kingdom. Three days after the UK release, it went on general release in the US, opening in 788 theatres with 900 prints struck; it was United Artists' widest opening at the time. It grossed $14,744,718 in its first week from 900 bookings. On the mainland of Europe, the most common month of release was in August 1979, opening in the Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden between 13 and 18 August. Given that the film was produced largely in France, and it involved some notable French actors, the French premiere for the film was relatively late, released in that country on 10 October 1979. Moonraker grossed a worldwide total of $210,300,000. Moonraker received a mixed reception by critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 59% approval rating based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 5.51/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Featuring one of the series' more ludicrous plots but outfitted with primo gadgets and spectacular sets, Moonraker is both silly and entertaining.\\" The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby called Moonraker \\"one of the most buoyant Bond films of all. Almost everyone connected with the movie is in top form, even Mr. Moore. Here he's as ageless, resourceful, and graceful as the character he inhabits.\\" Available online. Canby subsequently said the film was, alongside Goldfinger, the best of the series. Available online. The Globe and Mail critic Jay Scott said Moonraker was second only to Goldfinger. \\"In the first few minutes ‚Äì before the credits ‚Äì it offers more thrills than most escapist movies provide in two hours.\\" During the title sequence, \\"the excitement has gone all the way up to giddy and never comes down.\\" Scott admired the film's theme song and cited with approval the film's location work. He also singled out Ken Adam's sets, dubbing them \\"high-tech Piranesi.\\" Frank Rich of Time felt \\"The result is a film that is irresistibly entertaining as only truly mindless spectacle can be. Those who have held out on Bond movies over 17 years may not be convinced by Moonraker, but everyone else will be.\\" Reviewers such as James Berardinelli praised the visual effects and stunts, and film scholar James Monaco designated the film a \\"minor masterpiece\\" and declared it the best Bond film of them all. However, most critics consider Moonraker one of the lesser films in the series, largely due to the extent and absurdity of the plot which takes James Bond into space, some of the ploys used in the film for comedic effect, and its extended dialogue. In November 2006, Entertainment Weekly ranked Moonraker fourteenth among the Bond films, describing it as \\"by far the campiest of all 007 movies\\" with \\"one of the worst theme songs\\"; while IGN listed it as eleventh, calling it outlandish and saying that despite the actors \\"trying what they can to ground the film in reality, the laser gun/space station finale pretty much undercuts their efforts\\"; and Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the fourth worst film of the series, considering that the film \\"just flat-out sucks\\". Critic Nicholas Sylvain said \\"Moonraker seems to have more than its share of little flaws and annoyances which begin right from the opening pre-credit sequence. The sheer idiocy (and impossibility) of having a fully fueled shuttle on the back of the Boeing during the trans-Atlantic crossing should be evident, and later in the film, the whole Jaws-falls-in-love and becomes a 'good guy' routine leaves me rather cold, and provides far too much cheesy comedy moments, as does the gondola driving through the square scene.\\" The scene in which Moore drives a hovercraft gondola around St Mark's Square in Venice was widely criticised by film critics. In his review of Moonraker in 1979, the Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, while clearly expressing his approval of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, criticised the pace in which the locations of the film evolved, remarking, \\"it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond has to move at a trot just to make it into all the scenes\\". Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said of the film: \\"Most rational observers agree that Moonraker is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time\\". However, while he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences, he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark \\"I think he's attempting re-entry!\\" by \\"Q\\" during Bond and Goodhead's orbiting of the Earth which he described as \\"featuring what might be the best double entendre ever\\". Reviewing Moonraker, film critic Danny Peary wrote, \\"The worst James Bond film to date has Roger Moore walking through the paces for his hefty paycheck and giving way to his double for a series of unimaginative action scenes and 'humorous' chases. There's little suspense and the humor falls flat. Not only is Jaws so pacified by love that he becomes a good guy, but the filmmakers also have the gall to set the finale in outer space and stage a battle right out of Star Wars.\\"Danny Peary, Guide for the Film Fanatic (Simon & Schuster, 1986) p. 281 The exaggerated nature of the plot and space station sequence has seen the film parodied on numerous occasions. Of note is the Austin Powers spoof film The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) which while a parody of other James Bond films, pays reference to Moonraker by Dr. Evil's lair in space. The scene in which Drax is shot by the cyanide dart and ousted into space is parodied by Powers' ejection of Dr. Evil's clone Mini-Me into outer space in the same way. Sean Connery, who had played James Bond in six of the first seven films in the series, stated in an interview that: \\"I went in London to see Moonraker with Roger and I think it's departed so much from any sort of credence from the reality that we had [in my six films].\\" He also criticized the film for: \\"such a dependence on the effects and there's no substance.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qros3Bsrb9A However, the opening skydiving sequence, in which Bond is pushed out of an airplane by Jaws, and must obtain a parachute from the pilot skydiving below him, has come to be considered one of the series best pre-title sequences. It is frequently lauded by critics and fans as one of the most spectacular action sequences in the Bond series. Accolades Derek Meddings, Paul Wilson and John Evans were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and the film was nominated for three Saturn Awards, Best Science Fiction Film, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actor (Richard Kiel).

It was directed by Terence Young, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and written by Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, based on Ian Fleming's similarly named 1957 novel. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet consulate clerk Tatiana Romanova in Turkey, where SPECTRE plans to avenge Bond's killing of Dr. No. Following the success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire, and in Scotland. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date. From Russia with Love was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor Dr. No, thereby becoming a blockbuster in 1960s cinema. This film also marked the debut of Desmond Llewelyn as Q, a role he would play for 36 years (and seventeen films) until The World Is Not Enough in 1999. It also marked the final role of Pedro Armend√°riz, who died of suicide four months before the film's release.  Plot  Seeking revenge against MI6 agent James Bond for the death of their agent Dr. No in Jamaica, international criminal organisation SPECTRE begins training agents to kill him, before assigning the task to Irish assassin Donald \\"Red\\" Grant. To lure Bond into a trap, SPECTRE's chief planner, Czechoslovak chess grandmaster Kronsteen, devises a plan to have him attempt to procure a Lektor cryptography device from the Soviets from their consulate in Istanbul. SPECTRE operative Rosa Klebb, a former SMERSH (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, is assigned to oversee the mission and to ensure Grant can carry out Bond's assassination at the right moment. To set the trap, Klebb recruits a cipher clerk at the consulate, Tatiana Romanova, to unwittingly assist in the plan, tricking her into believing she is still working for SMERSH. In London, Bond is called to a meeting with M and informed that Romanova has requested his help to defect to the West, in exchange for providing British intelligence a Lektor. Exactly as Kronsteen predicted, M suspects a trap but decides to honour Romanova's request. Before departing, Bond is given a special attach√© case by Q, containing several defensive gadgets and an ArmaLite AR-7 sniper rifle, to help on his assignment. Upon arriving in Istanbul, Bond works alongside the head of MI6's branch in the city, Ali Kerim Bey, while he awaits word from Romanova. During this time, Kerim is attacked by Soviet agent Krilencu, who causes problems for the men, unaware that Grant is shadowing Bond to protect him until he steals the Lektor. After an attack on the men while they hide out at a gypsy settlement, Kerim asks Bond for his help in killing Krilencu, before he can flee the city. Eventually, Romanova contacts Bond to meet him at a hotel suite, where she reveals she will provide plans to the consulate for him to help him steal the Lektor. Before they part ways, the pair spend the night together, unaware SPECTRE is filming them as part of Kronsteen's plan. Upon receiving the consulate's floor plans from Romanova, Bond and Kerim make a plan to steal the Lektor, before all three make haste to escape the city aboard the Orient Express. Once aboard, Kerim discovers a Soviet security officer tailed them, forcing Bond to help him subdue them. While Kerim remains with him to prevent him escaping, Bond returns to Romanova to wait for their rendezvous with one of Kerim's men. However, Grant kills Kerim and the officer, forcing Bond to remain on the train and question Romanova's motive. When the train arrives in Belgrade, Bond passes on news of Kerim's death to one of his sons waiting for them and receives instructions to travel to Zagreb and receive help from a British agent named Nash. Grant intercepts Nash when they arrive and kills him off-camera, before posing as Nash to them. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond. He quickly reveals that Romanova was a pawn in SPECTRE's plan and that he intends to kill both and stage it as a murder- suicide, leaving behind fake blackmail evidence that will scandalise the British intelligence community. However, Bond gets the upper hand by tricking Grant into setting off a booby trap in his attach√© case before killing him. Escaping from the train in Istria, Yugoslavia, with the Lektor, the fake evidence, and Romanova, Bond uses Grant's escape plan to flee, evading attacks by SPECTRE agents, first in a helicopter and then on boats in the Adriatic Sea. Learning of Grant's death and Bond's survival, SPECTRE's enigmatic chairman (Number 1) has Kronsteen executed for his plan's disastrous failure. As the organisation promised to sell back the Lektor to the Russians, Klebb is ordered to recover it and kill Bond. Klebb reaches the pair, while they are resting in a hotel in Venice, and sneaks into their room disguised as a maid. However, Romanova recognises Klebb and kills her when she tries to poison Bond. With their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova spend some time on a romantic boat ride, during which time Grant's blackmail evidence is disposed of into the canal.

Uncredited performances include Michael Culver and Elizabeth Counsell as a couple in a punt and William Hill as Captain Nash, a British agent killed and impersonated by Red Grant. Production Following the financial success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved a bonus for Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia with Love among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia with Love was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam, who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain; title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn, and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film.Brosnan, John James Bond in the Cinema Tantivy Press; 2nd edition (1981) John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack. The film introduced several conventions which would become essential elements of the series: a pre-title sequence, the Blofeld character (referred to in the film only as \\"Number 1\\") (though Blofeld is mentioned in the end credits, with the actor referred to only as \\"?\\"), a secret-weapon gadget for Bond, a helicopter sequence (repeated in every subsequent Bond film except The Man with the Golden Gun), a postscript action scene after the main climax, a theme song with lyrics, and the line \\"James Bond will return/be back\\" in the credits. Writing Ian Fleming's novel was a Cold War thriller but the producers replaced the Soviet undercover agency SMERSH with the crime syndicate SPECTRE so as to avoid controversial political overtones. The SPECTRE training grounds were inspired by the film Spartacus. The original screenwriter was Len Deighton, who accompanied Harry Saltzman, Syd Cain, and Terence Young to Istanbul but he was replaced because of a lack of progress. Thus, two of Dr. Nos writers, Johanna Harwood and Richard Maibaum, returned for the second film in the series. Some sources state Harwood was credited for the \\"adaptation\\" mostly for her suggestions which were carried over into Maibaum's script. Harwood stated in an interview for Cinema Retro that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects, and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novel closely, but she left the series due to what she called Terence Young's constant rewriting of her screenplay with ideas that were not in the original Fleming work.Johanna Harwood Interview Movie Classics # 4 Solo Publishing 2012 Maibaum kept on making rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant was added to the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey; this brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during shooting involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For the last quarter of the movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice. Uncredited rewrites were contributed by Berkely Mather. Casting Although uncredited, the actor who played Number 1 was Anthony Dawson, who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, Dr. No, and appeared in several of Terence Young's films. In the end credits, Blofeld is credited with a question mark. Blofeld's lines were redubbed by Viennese actor Eric Pohlmann in the final cut. Peter Burton was unavailable to return as Major Boothroyd, so Desmond Llewelyn, a Welsh actor who was a fan of the Bond comic strip published in the Daily Express, accepted the part. However, screen credit for Llewelyn was omitted at the opening of the film and is reserved for the exit credits, where he is credited simply as \\"Boothroyd\\". Llewelyn's character is not referred to by this name in dialogue, but M does introduce him as being from Q Branch. Llewelyn remained as the character, better known as Q, in all but one of the series' films until his death in 1999. Several actresses were considered for the role of Tatiana, including Italians Sylva Koscina and Virna Lisi, Danish actress Annette Vadim, and English-born Tania Mallet. 1960 Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi started taking English classes for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to have her lines redubbed by British stage actress Barbara Jefford in the final cut.From Russia with Love audio commentary, Ultimate Edition DVD The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Bianchi's screen test, with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond. The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls. In her initial scene with Klebb, Tatiana refers to training for the ballet, referencing the actress's real life background. Greek actress Katina Paxinou was originally considered for the role of Rosa Klebb, but was unavailable. Terence Young cast Austrian singer Lotte Lenya after hearing one of her musical recordings. Young wanted Kronsteen's portrayer to be \\"an actor with a remarkable face\\", so the minor character would be well remembered by audiences. This led to the casting of Vladek Sheybal, whom Young also considered convincing as an intellectual. Several women were tested for the roles of Vida and Zora, the two fighting Gypsy girls, and after Aliza Gur and Martine Beswick were cast, they spent six weeks practising their fight choreography with stunt work arranger Peter Perkins. Beswick was mis-credited as 'Martin Beswick' in the film's opening titles, but this error was fixed for the 2001 DVD release. Mexican actor Pedro Armend√°riz was recommended to Young by director John Ford to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort on location in Istanbul, Armend√°riz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armend√°riz's scenes were brought forward so that he could complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When he could no longer work, he returned home and took his own life. Remaining shots after Armend√°riz left London had a stunt double and Terence Young himself as stand-ins. Englishman Joe Robinson was a strong contender for the role of Red Grant but it was given to Robert Shaw. Filming Most of the film was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations included the Basilica Cistern, Hagia Sophia and the Sirkeci railway station, which also was used for the Belgrade and Zagreb railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at Pinewood Studios with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in Eastern Europe. The journey and the truck ride were shot in Argyll, Scotland and Switzerland. The end scenes for the film were shot in Venice. However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent of the film had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth. The Gypsy camp was also to be filmed in an actual camp in Topkapi, but was actually shot in a replica of it in Pinewood. The scene with rats (after the theft of the Lektor) was shot in Spain, as Britain did not allow filming with wild rats, and an attempt to film white rats painted in cocoa in Turkey did not work. Principal photography began on 1 April 1963, and wrapped on 23 August. Ian Fleming spent a week in the Istanbul shoot, supervising production and touring the city with the producers. Director Terence Young's eye for realism was evident throughout production. For the opening chess match, Kronsteen wins the game with a reenactment of Boris Spassky's victory over David Bronstein in 1960. Production Designer Syd Cain built up the \\"chess pawn\\" motif in his $150,000 set for the brief sequence. Cain also later added a promotion to another movie Eon was producing, making Krilencu's death happen inside a billboard for Call Me Bwana. A noteworthy gadget featured was the attach√© case (briefcase) issued by Q Branch. It had a tear gas bomb that detonated if the case was improperly opened, a folding AR-7 sniper rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 gold sovereigns. A boxer at Cambridge, Young choreographed the fight between Grant and Bond along with stunt coordinator Peter Perkins. The scene took three weeks to film and was violent enough to worry some on the production. Robert Shaw and Connery did most of the stunts themselves. After the unexpected loss of Armend√°riz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were still to be filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young came up with the idea of moving the Red Grant training sequence to the beginning of the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to refilm Lotte Lenya's lines. Behind schedule and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production in time for the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland, for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40‚Äì50 feet (12‚Äì15 m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6 am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed. The helicopter and boat chase scenes were not in the original novel but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by the crop-dusting scene in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, The Red Beret. These two scenes would initially be shot in Istanbul but were moved to Scotland. The speedboats could not go fast enough due to the many waves in the sea, and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus. A helicopter was also hard to obtain, and the special effects crew were nearly arrested trying to get one at a local airbase. The helicopter chase was filmed with a radio controlled miniature helicopter. The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post- production since the boats were not loud enough, and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of control, burning Walter Gotell's eyelids and seriously injuring three stuntmen. Photographer David Hurn was commissioned by the producers of the James Bond films to shoot a series of stills with Sean Connery and the actresses of the film. When the theatrical property Walther PPK pistol did not arrive, Hurn volunteered the use of his own Walther LP-53 air pistol.\\"http://christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID;=1992033 Though the photographs of the \\"James Bond is Back\\" posters of the US release airbrushed out the long barrel of the pistol, film poster artist Renato Fratini used the long-barrelled pistol for his drawings of Connery on the British posters. For the opening credits, Maurice Binder had disagreements with the producers and did not want to return.Starlog magazine Maurice Binder interview Part 1 Designer Robert Brownjohn stepped into his place, and projected the credits on female dancers, inspired by constructivist artist L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy projecting light onto clouds in the 1920s. Brownjohn's work started the tradition of scantily clad women in the Bond films' title sequences. Music From Russia with Love is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary soundtrack composer. The theme song was composed by Lionel Bart of Oliver! fame and sung by Matt Monro, although the title credit music is a lively instrumental version of the tune beginning with Barry's brief \\"James Bond Is Back\\" then segueing into Monty Norman's \\"James Bond Theme\\". Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles. Barry travelled with the crew to Turkey to try getting influences of the local music, but ended up using almost nothing, just local instruments such as finger cymbals to give an exotic feeling, since he thought the Turkish music had a comedic tone that did not fit in the \\"dramatic feeling\\" of the James Bond movies. Recalling his visit to Istanbul, John Barry said, \\"It was like no place I'd ever been in my life. [The Trip] was supposedly to seep up the music, so Noel Rogers and I used to go 'round to these nightclubs and listen to all this stuff. We had the strangest week, and really came away with nothing, except a lot of ridiculous stories. We went back, talked to Lionel, and then he wrote 'From Russia with Love. In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme \\"007\\"‚Äîaction music that came to be considered the \\"secondary James Bond theme\\". He composed it to have a lighter, enthusiastic and more adventurous theme to relax the audience. The arrangement appears twice on the soundtrack album; the second version, entitled \\"007 Takes the Lektor\\", is the one used during the gunfight at the Gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine. The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised Dr. No music; the post-rocket-launch music from Dr. No is played in From Russia with Love during the helicopter and speedboat attacks. Release and reception From Russia with Love premiered on 10 October 1963 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London. Ian Fleming, Sean Connery and Walter Gotell attended the premiere. The following year, it was released in 16 countries worldwide, with the United States premiere on 8 April 1964, at New York's Astor Theatre. Upon its first release, From Russia with Love doubled Dr. Nos gross by earning $12.5 million ($ million in dollars) at the worldwide box office. After reissue it grossed $78 million, of which $24 million was from North America. It was the most popular movie at the British box office in 1963. The film's cinematographer Ted Moore won the BAFTA award and the British Society of Cinematographers award for Best Cinematography. At the 1965 Laurel Awards, Lotte Lenya stood third for Best Female Supporting Performance, and the film secured second place in the Action-Drama category. The film was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for \\"From Russia with Love\\". Contemporary reviews In comparing the film to its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love \\"didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving.\\" He went on to say that \\"... the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun.\\" Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that \\"The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture.\\" Gilliatt went on to say that the film manages \\"to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks\\". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is \\"the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular ... except in morality, where he has the courage‚Äîand the physical equipment‚Äîto do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing ...\\" The critic thought that overall, \\"the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers\\". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said: \\"Don't miss it! This is to say, don't miss it if you can still get the least bit of fun out of lurid adventure fiction and pseudo-realistic fantasy. For this mad melodramatization of a desperate adventure of Bond with sinister characters in Istanbul and on the Orient Express is fictional exaggeration on a grand scale and in a dashing style, thoroughly illogical and improbable, but with tongue blithely wedged in cheek.\\" Time magazine called the film \\"fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed\\" and commented extensively on the film's humour, saying \\"Director Young is a master of the form he ridicules, and in almost every episode he hands the audience shocks as well as yocks. But the yocks are more memorable. They result from slight but sly infractions of the thriller formula. A Russian agent, for instance, does not simply escape through a window; no, he escapes through a window in a brick wall painted with a colossal poster portrait of Anita Ekberg, and as he crawls out of the window, he seems to be crawling out of Anita's mouth. Or again, Bond does not simply train a telescope on the Russian consulate and hope he can read somebody's lips; no, he makes his way laboriously into a gallery beneath the joint, runs a submarine periscope up through the walls, and there, at close range, inspects two important Soviet secrets: the heroine's legs.\\" Later reviews From Russia with Love received critical praise from critics decades following the film's original release and is considered to be amongst the finest of Connery's 007 tenure. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 57 reviewers and judged 95% of the reviews to be positive with a rating of 8/10. Its summary states: \\"The second James Bond film, From Russia with Love, is a razor-sharp, briskly-paced Cold War thriller that features several electrifying action scenes.\\" Many online sites also commonly cite From Russia with Love as the best Bond film of all time. In his 1986 book, Danny Peary described From Russia with Love as \\"an excellent, surprisingly tough and gritty James Bond film\\" which is \\"refreshingly free of the gimmickry that would characterise the later Bond films, and Connery and Bianchi play real people. We worry about them and hope their relationship will work out ... Shaw and Lotte Lenya are splendid villains. Both have exciting, well-choreographed fights with Connery. Actors play it straight, with excellent results.\\"Danny Peary, Guide for the Film Fanatic (Simon & Schuster, 1986) p.163 Film critic James Berardinelli cited this as his favourite Bond film, writing \\"Only From Russia with Love avoids slipping into the comic book realm of Goldfinger and its successors while giving us a sampling of the familiar Bond formula (action, gadgets, women, cars, etc.). From Russia with Love is effectively paced and plotted, features a gallery of detestable rogues (including the ultimate Bond villain, Blofeld), and offers countless thrills\\". In June 2001 Neil Smith of BBC Films called it \\"a film that only gets better with age\\". In 2004, Total Film magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time, making it the only James Bond film to appear on the list. In 2006, Jay Antani of Filmcritic praised the film's \\"impressive staging of action scenes\\", while IGN listed it as second-best Bond film ever, behind only Goldfinger. That same year, Entertainment Weekly put the film at ninth among Bond films, criticising the slow pace. When the \\"James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set\\" was released in November 2007 by MGM, Norman Wilner of MSN chose From Russia with Love as the best Bond film. Conversely, in his book about the Bond phenomenon, The Man With the Golden Touch, British author Sinclair McKay states \\"I know it is heresy to say so, and that some enthusiasts regard From Russia With Love as the Holy Grail of Bond, but let's be searingly honest ‚Äì some of it is crashingly dull.\\"McKay, Sinclair. The Man With the Golden Touch. Overlook Press: New York. 2008. Pg. 4 In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films; From Russia With Love was listed at 69. The British Film Institute's screenonline guide called the film \\"one of the series' high points\\" and said it \\"had advantages not enjoyed by many later Bond films, notably an intelligent script that retained the substance of Ian Fleming's novel while toning down the overt Cold War politics (the Cuban Missile Crisis had only occurred the previous year).\\" In 2008, Michael G. Wilson, the current co-producer of the series, stated \\"We always start out trying to make another From Russia with Love and end up with another Thunderball.\\" Sean Connery, Michael G. Wilson, Barbara Broccoli, Timothy Dalton and Daniel Craig also consider this their favourite Bond film. Albert Broccoli listed it with Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me as one of his top three favourites, explaining that he felt \\"it was with this film that the Bond style and formula were perfected\\". Video game adaptation In 2005, the From Russia with Love video game was developed by Electronic Arts and released on 1 November 2005 in North America. It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation SPECTRE to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long- running legal dispute over the film rights to Thunderball between United Artists/MGM and writer Kevin McClory. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in Never Say Never Again. Featuring a third-person multiplayer deathmatch mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the Aston Martin DB5 from Goldfinger (1964) and the rocket belt from Thunderball (1965). The game was penned by Bruce Feirstein, who had previously worked on the film scripts for GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, and the 2004 video game, Everything or Nothing. Its soundtrack was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Vic Flick.

The band's moniker was lifted from Mick Jagger's published opinion about the 1960s rock band Herman's Hermits. Pure Rubbish had three records released between 1998 and 2001. The band also recorded a debut album produced by Mike Clink entitled Glamorous Youth (2001) that never saw an official release. The band played on multiple US and UK tours and were included on the Ozzfest 2001 tour in addition to opening shows for AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Mot√∂rhead, Nashville Pussy, The Dictators, Backyard Babies, Supersuckers, Marilyn Manson, and Linkin Park. Pure Rubbish was published in such magazines as Rolling Stone, Spin, Billboard, Guitar World, Metal Edge, and Kerrang!. The band also appeared on MTV, VH1, and E!, including the 2002 MTV Movie Awards backing Kelly Osbourne. Early years (1995-2000) Pure Rubbish began in 1995 when brothers Derek (guitar) and Evan (drums) Dunivan were only 11 and 9 years old. The young Dunivan brothers were self-taught musicians and learned to play their instruments by listening to records. They recruited their dad Willie Dunivan on lead vocals in late 1995. Willie Dunivan, at 34, was already a veteran musician of the local Houston music scene with his own band Personality Crisis as well as stints in short lived bands including Cheetah Chrome Project with the former Dead Boys guitarist and Michael Bruce Band with the former Alice Cooper Band guitarist. Willie Dunivan's earliest bands included the 1980s rock bands Apeshit and Hip Cat's Alley and he also played drums for the Houston 1990s punk band Stinkerbell. A charismatic frontman and great songwriter, Willie Dunivan was responsible for launching Pure Rubbish into reality. Musically, the Dunivan brothers were exposed to a wide range of influences. Their main influences were 1960s & 1970s rock, 1970s glam, and 1970s punk rock, but also absorbed the music of 1950s rock n roll, blues, r & b, and 1950s & 1960s country. These influences were culled from years of sifting through Willie's huge music collection. The band's sound was self labeled \\"trash rock\\" and \\"glam punk\\" and was a combination of all their musical influences. The band's first show on December 9, 1995, was a KISS tribute concert with Personality Crisis bassist Robin Geiger completing the lineup. Geiger played a few more shows with the band into 1996 lending his help until the band could find a full-time bassist. After seeing Pure Rubbish at the Westheimer Street Festival Morgan \\"Donor\\" Thompson at 14 years old was recruited to fill the bass position in summer 1996. Later that year Derek broke his arm and the band went on a temporarily hiatus. Following the hiatus, the band made up for the lost time by gigging heavily around Texas in 1997 opening for many national acts. A friendship with the members of Nashville Pussy resulted in Pure Rubbish opening for the band the following year on a summer east coast tour. (Derek and Evan could only tour in the summer due to still being in school) While in New York City, the band met with A&R; executive Tom Zutaut (who signed Guns N' Roses) which was the first time the band had any sort of major label interest. The band also released their first independent record Heavy Trash Day 7\\" EP / Tape in 1998 on Willie's own One Hit Records imprint. Morgan Thompson left the band later in 1998 and was replaced by Mike McWilliams on bass and Allan \\"Al G.\\" Nelson on guitar. Both Mike and Al G. were from the recently transplanted Houston to Austin punk band Teen Cool. At this point Pure Rubbish had generated a minor buzz around the east coast and did another east coast tour in June and July 1999. The band booked a recording session with producer Daniel Rey (Ramones, Misfits) in New York City while in town. The tour went well but a few months afterwards Al G. parted ways with the band. Later that year, the Daniel Rey recording session was released as the \\"Tejas Waste\\" CD EP, the band's second independent record also released on One Hit Records. In early 2000, Pure Rubbish attended that year's South By Southwest festival and met (current Mot√∂rhead and future Pure Rubbish manager) Todd Singerman at one of the festival's shows that included both Mot√∂rhead and Nashville Pussy on the bill. March 2000 saw Jarrett \\"JT Trash\\" Gardner added to the band on guitar for the departed Al G. The meeting with Todd Singerman resulted in a June midwest tour with Pure Rubbish opening for the bands Mot√∂rhead, Nashville Pussy, and the Supersuckers. The tour was the highest profile appearance for the band at that point. Pure Rubbish headed out on their first west coast tour in July and August. On the first date of the tour in Los Angeles, Todd Singerman brought A&R; coordinator Scott Givens of Ozzy Osbourne's Divine Recordings out to see the band. On the strength of that show, Pure Rubbish was courted by Divine. The rest of the tour was a success with Lemmy from Mot√∂rhead. Around this time, Willie Dunivan passed the lead vocal duties to his son Derek who at 15 assumed the frontman role for the band. Upon returning to Houston after the tour and on the request of Scott Givens and Lemmy, Sharon Osbourne flew down to see the band play a showcase gig in October. Willie sang for the first half of the set followed by the new lineup of Derek - lead vocals / lead guitar, Evan -drums, Mike - bass / backing vocals, and Jarrett - rhythm guitar / backing vocals making their first live appearance without Willie. This show marked the first time Derek had sung lead vocals live. The showcase gig was well received and after negotiations, Pure Rubbish officially signed to Divine Recordings in November 2000. Later years (2001-2003) In December 2000, Pure Rubbish entered Digital Recordings in Houston to record their debut album, Glamorous Youth (produced by Mike Clink who also produced Guns N' Roses album Appetite for Destruction). They later went to Los Angeles, California to finish the album at Rumbo Recorders studio from January through March 2001. After the album was completed the band headed back to Houston briefly, only to head back to L.A. to play some promotional showcase gigs. May 2001 saw the band play Ozzfest UK at Milton Keynes, England and three shows in London supporting Mot√∂rhead and the Backyard Babies. Pure Rubbish toured that summer from June through August on the Second Stage of Ozzfest 2001 headlined by Black Sabbath. The tour helped expose the band to new fans along with having segments aired on MTV‚Äôs You Hear It First program and VH1‚Äôs The Rock Show, but was also a challenge as Pure Rubbish‚Äôs brand of rock n‚Äô roll was out of step with the other bands. The band did win over many new fans that found their sound refreshing and called back to an era when hard rock was dangerous and real. In the middle of the tour Pure Rubbish flew over to Paris, France to play a high-profile gig as opening bill on the AC/DC ‚ÄúStiff Upper Lip Tour‚Äù. The show was a huge success and the band came back to the States reenergized to finish the rest of the Ozzfest 2001 tour. were 4 songs taken from the Glamorous Youth sessions and released as the S/T EP in August 2001 with different mixes of the songs. Shortly after Ozzfest that summer, the band‚Äôs debut full-length album Glamorous Youth was slated for release but was delayed because the label thought the production was too dated. In 2002, the band continued to play shows while working on new material for a planned (at that time untitled) new album to be recorded consisting of some of the songs recorded for Glamorous Youth along with the band‚Äôs newly written songs. They were frustrated over the Mike Clink produced Glamorous Youth album being shelved, but were anxious to record their new songs and start touring again. Again, the release date for the new album was pushed back to summer / fall 2002. Roadrunner Records was to fund the recording of the new album and the producer chosen was Ed Stasium (Ramones, Misfits). Roadrunner thought they could give the songs and album a more modern day production job, which they felt would ensure the album better success. In June 2002, the band (on Sharon Osbourne‚Äôs behalf) journeyed to L.A. staying for a month and appeared as Kelly Osbourne‚Äôs backing band on the 2002 MTV Movie Awards and the yearly Wango Tango concert. After backing Kelly, Pure Rubbish went into EMI Studios to record demos for Roadrunner Records. However, only demos of newer songs the band had been working on from mid-2001 - mid-2002 were recorded. A feature article in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine surfaced that July, which chronicled Pure Rubbish‚Äôs tour escapades through the eyes of the youngest band to ever play on Ozzfest. Upon returning to Houston in July 2002, the band dropped most of the old Glamorous Youth songs and even the newer demos they had recorded for Roadrunner in favor of music that was quite different from the songs the band had been playing only months before. Pure Rubbish‚Äôs sound was changing drastically and the band pitched many of the self - produced demos to Roadrunner. Needless to say, Roadrunner (as well as the band‚Äôs managers) were confused over the band‚Äôs sudden new change in musical direction. Roadrunner wanted the band to keep their original hard rock style and conflicts arose regarding which songs to record for a debut (to the public) full length Pure Rubbish album. Roadrunner would sign the band only if the band they agreed to continue with their original sound. The band were unwilling to meet Roadrunner‚Äôs terms and this disagreement led to the demise of the Roadrunner deal. Pure Rubbish continued from mid-2002 into the early months of 2003 but internal musical differences eventually split the band into two different camps concerning what they wanted to do musically. Derek and Evan wanted to create an original sound drawing from (their now key influences) the Beatles, David Bowie, and Radiohead, while Mike and Jarrett wanted to continue playing no frills rock n‚Äô roll. Pure Rubbish officially split up in April 2003 with Derek and Evan continuing to pursue their musical aspirations in their band Penny Royal, and Mike and Jarrett forming the Urgencies in summer 2003 with Al G. and Shawn. (Mike McWilliams, Allan Nelson, and Shawn Peters had all previously played together in their teen years in the Houston punk band, The Creeps and Teen Cool between 1994-2002. Before playing in Pure Rubbish, Jarrett Gardner previously played in his Houston punk bands, The Green Goblins and The Baysides between 1998‚Äì2000) After the breakup of Pure Rubbish in April 2003, Derek Dunivan and his dad Willie Dunivan both toured the country with New York Dolls guitarist Sylvain Sylvain in July 2003. Derek was recruited on bass and Willie was recruited on additional vocals. Derek Dunivan was featured in the book \\"Uncommon Sound\\" (2006) written by John Engel specifically about left-handed guitar players.

Users can sign up to send and receive messages to and from various groups, which are organized around a range of different topics. How the service works The TXTMob service will forward messages received to all members of a particular group as they are received. In an unmoderated group, any group member can send a text message to be received by all other members of that group. Groups can also be moderated, in which case the group is set up as a sort of announcement-only group, which is used primarily as a one-way conduit of information and text messages can only be sent by selected people (often just that group's particular administrator). Private, public, and secret TXTMob groups A public group is one which any TXTMob member may join. Membership in a private group is limited by the group's administrators. When an individual first attempts to join a private group, his or her membership will be listed as \\"pending.\\" Once an administrator of the group upgrades their membership, they will be able to receive messages, and depending on if the group is moderated or not, send messages. Secret groups are similar to private groups in that membership is restricted by the group's administrators.

Thornton, 514 U.S. 779 (1995), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that states cannot impose qualifications for prospective members of the U.S. Congress stricter than those specified in the Constitution. The decision invalidated the Congressional term limit provisions of 23 states. The parties to the case were U.S. Term Limits, a non-profit advocacy group, and Arkansas politician Ray Thornton, among others.. Background Constitutional amendment 73 to the Arkansas Constitution denied ballot access to any federal Congressional candidate having already served three terms in the U.S. House or two terms in the U.S. Senate. However, such a candidate was not barred from being written- in and winning by that method. Soon after the amendment's adoption by ballot measure at the general election on November 3, 1992, Bobbie Hill, a member of the League of Women Voters, sued in state court to have it invalidated. She alleged that the new restrictions amounted to an unwarranted expansion of the specific qualifications for membership in Congress enumerated in the U.S. Constitution: and: Also critical to the issue is the 17th Amendment, which transferred power to select US Senators from the state legislature, to the people of the state: U.S. Term Limits claimed that Amendment 73 was \\"a permissible exercise of state power under the Elections Clause\\". Both the trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court agreed with Hill, declaring Amendment 73 unconstitutional.U.S. Term Limits v. Hill, 316 Ark. 251, 263, 872 S.W.2d 349, 355 (1994), aff'd sub nom.

The majority and minority articulated different views of the character of the federal structure established in the Constitution. Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens concluded that: He further ruled that sustaining Amendment 73 would result in \\"a patchwork of state qualifications\\" for U.S. Representatives, and described that consequence as inconsistent with \\"the uniformity and national character that the framers sought to ensure.\\" Concurring, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the amendment would interfere with the \\"relationship between the people of the Nation and their National Government.\\" Justice Clarence Thomas, in dissent, countered that: He also noted that the amendment did not actually prevent anyone from election since it only prevents prospective fourth termers from being printed on the ballot but not from being written in, and therefore did not overstep the qualifications clause of the federal Constitution.

It was owned by Patrick Joseph Stanton and had its offices and studios in the St. James Hotel. It was a daytimer, powered at 1,000 watts and forced to sign-off at sunset to avoid interfering with other stations on 1540 kHz. In the late 1950s, the station got a boost to 50,000 watts, but it still had to stay off the air at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1960 page A-219 In 1965 it was acquired by Rust Craft Greeting Cards, which changed the call letters to WRCP, which stood for Rust Craft Philadelphia.Broadcasting Yearbook 1967 page B-138 In 1967, Rust Craft changed the format to country music, a format not found on the Philadelphia radio dial.

Geography Spencer is bounded by the Hawkesbury River to the south and west and Mangrove Creek to the east. Despite the relatively short distance from the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway as the crow flies, a boat across Mangrove Creek significantly reduces the distance to be travelled. History Early British explorers stepped onto a \\"marshy outcrop\\" here whilst exploring the East Coast of Australia, and a monument commemorates this, near the kids playground and public toilet. Spencer is a township presumed to be named for the Parish in which it is situated. Originally this area was known as Fernleigh. The true name origin of Spencer is unclear, but it is believed to be named after George John Spencer, second Earl Spencer (1758-1834), who was first Lord of the admiralty in 1794, and who held this position until 1810. He was a mentor of Lord Nelson, and oversaw many of the Royal Navy's victories over the French. Economy The economy is rural and farming and fishing are the area's main sources of income.

It is part of the local government area. It was founded by Thomas Alison Scott and his wife Mary Anne Scott. Scott is widely regarded as the first person in Australia to grow sugar cane. The name of the suburb is derived from Scott's name, T.A.Scott. The suburb contains Tascott railway station, which is on the Main North railway line. The station opened in 1905 and was built largely to service a guesthouse known as 'Waterview' that had been established by Mary Scott. The station once had a particularly dangerous level crossing, between the platform and the curved cutting just to the north. Robert Scott, T.A.Scott's son and heir, was killed there by a train in 1920 and he was not the only fatality crossing the railway. For many years, this level crossing was the only means of road access to the area west of the railway station. The short platform at Tascott was also a cause of mishaps. A private road from Koolewong to Tascott was constructed in the late 1920s but a wooden bridge across the gully later collapsed and was not repaired. Access to both suburbs was greatly improved by the building of the 'waterfront road', now Brisbane Water Drive, in the late 1930s. For many years,the suburb was in four distinct parts; the area to the north of the station and west of the line, the area of waterfront adjacent to Point Clare, the area west of the station, and the area around Thomas Street. The dangerous level crossing at the station ceased to be used by cars some time in the 1960s. The level crossing near Thomas Street closed in 1963. Both crossings never had warning signals, just farm-style gates. For many years afterwards, pedestrians continued to cross the line at both these locations ‚Äî including to access the Up platform at the station or catch the bus on Brisbane Water Drive ‚Äî before the pedestrian overbridge was built at the station and the level crossing at the station was officially closed in 1984. The extension of Glenrock Parade, from the north of the station through to Koolewong, finally provided safe road access to the entire area of Tascott. Prior to this, the section of the road that intersected Thomas Street was known as Tascott Parade. Before the Second World War, Tascott was a minor holiday destination and, until the 1960s, the suburb was semi-rural. The flat ‚Äî formerly swampy ‚Äî area to the west of the railway station was a dairy farm, known as Tascott Dairy, which survived into the early 1960s. During this period, Tascott had no sewerage or reticulated water supply. Subdivisions, land sales, and the building of many new houses, led to a rapid growth in the population, during the 1960s and 1970s. The population of the suburb recorded at the 2016 census was 1,602; a decrease from the 1,706 recorded in 2011.

He resigned four years later to pursue a career in civil engineering on railroads in New York and overseas in Russia. After his return from Russia, he settled in Iowa, where he practiced law. Mexican-American War In 1846, at the beginning of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Roberts was reappointed a first lieutenant, Mounted Rifles, in the Regular Army. He was promoted to captain in 1847, and saw action at Veracruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras, Churubusco, and the capture of Mexico City, Matamoros and the Galajara pass.

The program and the concept are entirely new, originating in 1993 as a simplified form of the previously established (1992) Joint Contact Team Program (JCTP). The JCTP aimed at assisting former Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union Republics, now independent, to form democracies and defense forces of their own. It featured long-term presence of extensive and expensive teams of advisory specialists. The SPP shortened the advisory presence to a United States National Guard unit of a designated state, called a partner, which would conduct joint exercises with the host. It is cheaper, has a lesser American presence, and can comprise contacts with civilian agencies. Today both programs are funded. The SPP is widespread. The JCTP is recommended when more extensive support is needed. Sometimes the names are interchangeable. A large share of originally JCTP activity was subsumed by the NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) program made active in 1994. It prepares nations for membership in NATO. A typical path for a candidate has been SPP, PfP and then NATO. Once started, SPP activities appear to continue regardless of what other memberships a host nation may have. By nature the program creates close friends and allies. Previously, and currently outside the program, the Guard was and is subject to a jurisdictional duality: it can be either Federally active or not. If inactive it is a reserve component only of the DoD. Its main function is as a state militia under the command of the Governor through the Adjutant General of the state or equivalent officer of the Territory or D.C. If active, it is entirely out of the jurisdiction of the state and under the DoD, which might or might not keep its original identity, but more likely plunders it for replacements or special units of the Regular Army or Air Force. In the SPP, the State (or territory, etc.) and the DoD collaborate in the deployment of the unit, through the National Guard Bureau, and the Adjutant General of the State. The unit keeps its State identity. In the words of one source, it is \\"managed by the National Guard Bureau, but executed by the states.\\" In that case there is collaboration between the state Adjutant General and the commander in the field. The \\"partners\\" of the partnerships are the Guard units of various states and foreign nations that have requested and been granted partnerships. The program links National Guard units of U.S. States with partner countries around the world for the purpose of supporting the security cooperation objectives of the geographic Combatant Commands (CCMDs). It is not quite so cut-and-dried as pure security. There are quite a number of crisis relief and humanitarian activities. Legal basis for the program Title 10 authorization The deployment authorized by the SPP under the joint management of State and Federal governments can only be in the \\"State Partnership\\" relationship, which according to the current United States Code (USC)Title 10 Section 341, quoted in is defined as a \\"program of activities.\\" The Secretary of Defense is authorized to establish it between the \\"military forces,\\" the \\"security forces,\\" or the \\"governmental organizations\\" designed to respond to disasters or other emergencies, and the \\"National Guard of a state or territory.\\" The nature of the activities is that they must support United States \\"Security Cooperation\\" (SC) objectives. A State Partnership is thus an agreement between the United States and a foreign government to conduct joint security operations with the United States National Guard. These are mainly training exercises. They may (or may not) lead to membership of the partner in regional defense organizations. \\"For SPP events conducted overseas, National Guard members are typically placed in a duty status by orders issued under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 12301,\\" which is a list of various circumstances in which Secretary of Defense may issue an involuntary activation of the Guard as a Reserve Component of the DoD. The permission of the Governor may be required in some cases. \\"For SPP events conducted within the United States, National Guard members are placed in a duty status by orders issued under 32 U.S.C. 502. This permits the participating members to receive appropriate military pay and benefits.\\" 32 U.S. Code ¬ß 502 specifies that the uard must attend regular training exercises, for which they get paid. In summary, the Guard is either activated for out-of-country activities or regularly trained within it. No special SPP legislation is required. Statutory authority Although authorized to carry out a program of activities in general, \\"the SPP has no dedicated statutory authority; rather, SPP activities are currently carried out under one or more Title 10 (Armed Forces), Title 32 (National Guard) and National Defense Authorization Act authorities that are related to the types of missions conducted. The main authorities that may be used by SPP are:\\" Note that in December 2016 some of the legislation mentioned by Kapp & Serafino in 2011 was repealed, while other legislation was augmented or otherwise altered. * 10 U.S.C. 1051 (Multilateral, bilateral, or regional cooperation programs: payment of personnel expenses) \\"authorizes the Secretary of Defense to pay the travel, subsistence, and similar personal expenses of defense personnel of developing countries in connection with their attendance at a multilateral, bilateral, or regional conference, seminar, or similar meeting,\\" with certain restrictions. * 10 U.S. Code ¬ß 321 (Training with friendly foreign countries: payment of training and exercise expenses), changed from 10 U.S.C. 2010 (Combined Exercises), states \\"The armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense may train with the military forces or other security forces of a friendly foreign country....\\" * 10 U.S.C. 401 (Humanitarian and civic assistance provided in conjunction with military operations) authorizes the DOD \\"to carry out humanitarian and civic assistance activities in host nations in conjunction with military operations,\\" defined to include \\"medical, surgical, dental, and veterinary professionals ... construction of rudimentary surface transportation systems ... well drilling and construction of basic sanitation facilities ... rudimentary construction and repair of public facilities.\\" * 10 U.S.C. 2561 (Humanitarian Assistance) authorizes the expenditure of humanitarian assistance funds for the \\"transportation of humanitarian relief and other humanitarian purposes....\\" * 10 U.S.C. 2249c, renumbered to 345. Establishes the Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP). This organization is described in a report to Congress: \\"The Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP) was established to meet an emerging and urgent defense requirement to build partnerships in the struggle against violent extremism through targeted, non- lethal, combating terrorism (CbT) education and training. The CTFP directly supports DoD‚Äôs efforts by providing CbT education and training for mid- to senior-level international military officers, ministry of defense civilians, and security officials.\\" * \\"Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2006 ... provides the Secretary of Defense with authority to train and equip foreign military forces for two specified purposes ‚Äî counterterrorism and stability operations ‚Äî and foreign security forces for counterterrorism operations.

Financial basis for the program Expenses for the SPP partnerships are the standard maintenance required to keep Guard units in the field, the standard maintenance required by the partner units, which must be paid by the partner governments, and the \\"travel-related expenses\\" above and beyond them. The Guard units are maintained by \\"Army or Air Force Personal Accounts,\\" including \\"pay and allowances.\\" The travel-related expenses are paid from separate funds, the Operations and Maintenance (O&M;) accounts, of which there are many, such as the following:Since Kapp & Serafino wrote in 2011, the legislative authority of some funds has been repealed, while others have been altered. * National Guard Bureau‚Äôs International Affairs Division funds. * Combatant Commander‚Äôs Initiative Fund (CCIF), established under 10 U.S. Code 166a. Accessed only by the CJCS or someone designated by him, the fund is used for payments on request to a \\"commander of a combatant command\\" for a number of specified activities, such as joint exercises. * The Wales Initiative Fund (WIF) is a yearly amount voted by Congress to be used in support of NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) Program.The program was established in 1994 by NATO as an alternative to itself for new European nations formerly in Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union, who were not qualified, not yet qualified, or did not prefer membership in NATO but needed some coaching and other assistance in maintaining their \\"sovereignty and territorial integrity,\\" especially in the counter-terrorist field. Then President Clinton in a supportive speech given in Warsaw in January 1994, proposed an annual fund subsequently dubbed the \\"Warsaw Initiative Fund,\\" which began with FY 1996 and has not missed a year. Poland left the PfP in 1999 in favor of NATO. At the Wales NATO summit of September 2015, NATO voted to include Mediterranean nations in PfP. In 2015 the name of the fund was redubbed Wales Initiative Fund.

Specifically, all activities must support the Theater Campaign Plan (TCP) as well as individual U.S. Ambassador mission plans in the countries where they operate. The unique civil-military nature of the National Guard allows active participation in a wide range of security cooperation activities, such as: * emergency management and disaster response * border and port security * leadership and NCO development * medical capacities * economic security * natural resource protection * peacekeeping operations * counter trafficking * counter proliferation * counter terrorism Current partnerships The State Partnership Program consists of 78 partnerships (1 August 2020) with 84 sovereign countries across all six combatant commands. The discrepancy between 74 and 80 is due to there being one partnership with the Regional Security System (RSS), a prior security organization of 7 island nations in the Eastern Caribbean. All other cases follow the rule, one nation, one partnership. In some cases more than one Guard unit is partnered with a nation.

Its scope was originally limited to that theater under the jurisdiction of EUCOM. Reagan's change of policy The first move in the direction of the Partnership Program was a change in U.S. policy toward Eastern-bloc countries under President Ronald Reagan. The previous policy had been a consequence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a bloody suppression of a native Hungarian uprising by forces of the Soviet Union. Soviet tanks in the streets of Budapest were a scene depicted by the media of the times. The Soviets under Nikita Khrushchev seemed implacable in their resolution to pursue and eliminate all the revolutionaries they could find. Former co-nationals of Austria in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary had been an ally of the Third Reich, contributing some ten divisions to the invasion of Russia. They recanted in 1944, following the model of Italy's recantation, but it was too late. Overrun by Soviet forces on the way to Berlin, they became a satellite of the Soviet Union and member of the Warsaw Pact. They were behind the Iron Curtain. The revolutionaries called upon the United States for support. It offered them assurances of backing in the event of victory; however, no actual combat support was forthcoming. The CIA appeared to have lost all its arms caches. Khrushchev at last quipped that American support might be compared to the support of a rope suspending a hanged man; i.e., the Americans would encourage the Hungarians to hang themselves by revolting but would make no move to assist them. As a result of this American fiasco the government adopted a policy of never communicating with countries behind the Iron Curtain but always approaching the Soviet Union first. The gates between east and west were resolutely shut. The cold war was on. Over three decades later, President Reagan, standing near the Berlin Wall, delivered what has been called his Berlin Wall speech addressing Mikhail Gorbachev (not there in person), then General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: \\"... If you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union ... if you seek liberalization ... tear down this wall!\\" He had no idea how close it was to being torn down, and with it the Iron Curtain and the Cold War. The cost of maintaining the Soviet Union and its satellites against widespread dissent was too great. The economy was beyond control. Communist Party membership was falling off. As the region was falling into poverty and cynicism, Gorbachev had proposed to the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on March 6, 1986, policies of glasnost, or candidness of governmental process, and peristroika, reorganization. The sibling policies amounted to a license to self-determine. In May, 1989, Hungary, acting on its own, opened the border between itself and Austria, negating the Berlin wall, as Germans could travel between the two Germanies via Hungary and Austria. Its demolition began on November 9. German reunification was declared complete (and is celebrated as such) on October 3, 1990, considered the final settlement of World War II after 45 years of occupation. Russian troops everywhere were going home. Without fear of military intervention, the republics of the Soviet Union were negotiating their release and declaring independence. The dissolution of the Soviet Union was declared by itself on December 26, 1991. Gorbachev had been its last President. He was to recede gradually into obscurity. The President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, came to the fore. The Russian flag flew that evening at the Kremlin. The nations of the Warsaw Pact were no less eager to escape from it. The Pact declared itself dissolved on July 1, 1991, from lack of members. In 1990, with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact impending, the United States reversed its \\"hands-off\\" policy and began to seek military-to-military contacts with individual nations of the Eastern Bloc through EUCOM, the Unified Combatant Command that would logically have jurisdiction over such contacts. The DoD was encouraged to do so by Robie Palmer, ambassador to Hungary, supported by Caspar Weinberger. Palmer's new views were based on his observation of the \\"regime change\\" associated with the end of communism in Hungary (1989). Despite the fiasco of 1956, the Hungarians were still interested in the support of the United States. They had nothing to fear from Soviet tanks now. A former member of the Civil Rights Movement and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as well as being co-founder of the National Endowment for Democracy, Palmer was idealistically motivated to help bring about democracy in the Eastern Bloc nations. In 1988 and 1989 he had already initiated friendly visits between five NATO nations and five Warsaw Pact nations, which impressed both sides with their spirit of conviviality. These experiences were building confidence in amicable partnership. Both sides were learning that they did not need to be enemies. Pre-partnership programs and problems As the Soviet Union disintegrated between 1989 and 1991, U.S. government officials explored options to minimize instability and encourage democratic governments in the former Soviet bloc nations. One effort to address these policy goals was to expand military-to-military contacts with the newly independent states of Central and Eastern Europe. At the time the United States cautiously put the new policy before the Soviet Union. There would be in fact a failed attempt at a military coup in favor of restoring the old Soviet Union. The Americans not only found ready assent from the new Soviet Union, but that Union itself was asking for the assistance Reagan had promised if democratic and humanitarian measures were taken, such as tearing down the wall. In 1989 the DOD sponsored the Interagency Working Groups (IWG's) for the purpose of developing mil-to-mil contacts, one with the Soviet Union and one with Eastern and Central Europe. They were to be the oversight, or steering groups. The US-Soviet Union IWG did not outlast the break-up of the Soviet Union. The East Europe IWG met on August 15, 1990, to formulate objectives, of which the first was \\"Promoting development of non-political militaries accountable to democratically elected civilian leadership.\\" In November, 1990, the East Europe IWG initiated a two-year program of \\"confidence-building visits\\" by staff members of EUCOM: the legal advisor, the chaplain, the surgeon, etc., with reciprocal visits to EUCOM headquarters. The purpose of the visits was to open and maintain dialogues on various special topics. In November, 1991, the IWG delegated the authority to initiate such contacts in Europe to EUCOM. As the Soviet Union defeated an attempted military coup in August, 1991, which was attempting a restoration, and began to lose its Republics at an accelerated pace, the DoD became embued with a sense of urgency that outran the two-year program. Dick Cheney, United States Secretary of Defense, created independently a program of Bilateral Working Groups (BWG's), one per nation. A BWG would consist of senior officers in EUCOM and others from the host nation. They would agree to discuss \\"defense restructuring and reorganization.\\" The BWG's began in September, 1992. In November, Cheney turned the program over to the remaining IWG. Meanwhile, elated by its success, EUCOM went what turned out to be a bridge too far in proposing the EUCOM Coordination and Assistance Program (EUCAP), which would take the contact initiative away from the Eastern Bloc countries. The Americans themselves would identify and approach candidates instead of waiting for their applications. The Americans would on their own approach the country to discuss its \\"interests and capabilities,\\" offering a total package of military reconstruction. After consultation with the United States Department of State, EUCOM forwarded its ambitious proposal to Colin Powell, CJCS, on February 27, 1992. On December 16, 1991, Powell had already presented to his staff his idea of \\"contact teams.\\" One team of about 50 specialists would spend 6‚Äì12 months helping a host country reorganize its military. The program's written goals aimed at every conceivable ideal from respect for human rights, the rule of law, political democracy, and a market economy, to a complete understanding of and sensitivity to American culture; in short, total Americanization. They would in fact be trying to redefine the national culture. In the Spring of 1992, all the proposals arrived at the President's desk in Washington. The Presidential watch had changed. George H. W. Bush, Reagan's Vice President, was President since January, 1989. He was concerned about political stability and the disposition of the nuclear weapons in the possession of the former Soviet republics. Aiming at creating a stable policy for the region, he affirmed the IWG as the steering organization and turned over all the relevant programs to it. During the previous year, meanwhile, Gorbachev, seeing the end coming, had been struggling to create some portable unity that would carry on after the fall of the Soviet Union. He proposed changing the government to a federation called the Union of Sovereign States, a less centralized government in which the Republics would have more independence. It failed to win the unanimous approval of the nine loyal Republics (out of 15, the other six abstaining from the vote). A second proposal for the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was accepted and co- existed temporarily with the Soviet Union. It was an agreement to act together in matters of trade and security. Its core was the loyal nine, but the total membership would grow to 12. The difference between the 12 and the 15 was the three Baltic States: Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. They had been part of the Russian Empire, which inherited them from the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Russian Empire ended in 1917. The Baltics were ceded to Germany by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, March 3, 1918. When Germany conceded the loss of World War I, it attempted to retain the Baltics, who had been the left flank of the Eastern Front, through the use of Freikorps, supposedly non-national mercenary volunteers. The Russian Revolution began shortly and was settled by the Russian Civil War, which lasted November, 1917, through October, 1922. Units from the Baltic states fought on both sides, red (Bolshevik) and white (Czarist). The predominant theme in the states themselves was independence.A summary of the details of this politically complex war can be found in The western victors of WW I withheld any interference in the Russian Civil War, except for a disastrous attempted rescue of the Czar by British forces, which ended in the massacre of the Czar and all his family. At the end of the Civil War the Baltics were independent. The new Soviet Union was not strong enough to recapture them. On September 22, 1921, the League of Nations made a statement of its own by admitting the Baltic states. The Baltics were recaptured by invasion after the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact (popularly known as the Stalin‚ÄìHitler Pact) of August 23, 1939, in which Stalin and Hitler divided Poland into spheres of influence. Hitler's invasion of Poland was the immediate cause of WW II. The Baltics considered Stalin's invasion and therefore his acquisition of their countries illegal and invalid acts. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania redeclared independence, Latvia on August 21, 1991, and Estonia on August 20, 1991. Russian troops still occupied the countries. The Russians owned much of the industrial capacities. There was some Russian resistance to their departure, but Gorbachev was obliged to follow his policies. In 1991 the Russians abroad were left hanging without authorization, as their current country had not stationed them there. It was to be years before national partitions were complete, during which Russians and Americans coexisted in the same countries. The United States, under some urgency to forestall any Eastern-bloc backsliding, accelerated its IWG Program. Combining EUCOM's EUCAP with his own Contact Teams concept, on April 22, 1992, Colin Powell presented the Charter of a new program, the Joint Contact Team Program (JCTP). Command was to be entrusted to USCINCEUR (U.S. Command-in-Chief Europe, then Army General John Shalikashvili), the head of EUCOM. Contact Teams were to be sent forthwith to Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The JCTP was to feature a Headquarters Contact Team Program Office (CCTPO), as many Military Liaison Teams (MLT's) as there were host countries contacted, and the first contact personnel, the Traveling Contact Teams (TCT's). Attempted implementation of the program revealed its weaknesses immediately. Planned in the halls of the Pentagon, it was somewhat too grandiose for the field. Initially not enough qualified persons bilingual in the desired languages could be found even to begin the program. The DoD advertised for bilingual volunteers, conducting telephone interviews with the few bilinguals they did have. Eventually a concentration was found in the 10th Special Forces Group, a unit that had been working with EUCOM in Europe. They were recruited, but with an unforeseen effect in public relations. They were not hired for their fighting skills, yet it appeared that the program was preparing for some sort of invasive effort, which served to delay their acceptance. A sufficient number of bilinguals was not recruited until late in 1993. Meanwhile, they had to begin with what they had. By 1992, the MLT for the first country, Hungary, was only partly in place. Pushing on, the IWG was planning to send MLT's to Czechoslovakia and Poland, but the split of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia caused them to be deferred until 1993. Plans were made to extend invitations to all the Central and Eastern European countries, but the State Department reneged temporarily. The ambassadors believed it was too precipitous. Unrest in Romania and potential unrest in Albania caused their deferment. Despite the delays the IWG gradually began to approve countries for MLT's. With the expansion, a second difficulty began to appear, this time within the DoD. The Joint Staff was having a problem finding funds for the large budget submitted by EUCOM for only three host countries. It was at this time that CJCS initiated a search for special funds to enhance the regular budgets of the agencies involved. By 1994 the cost had run so high, 13 million as opposed to 1993's 6 million, that obtaining any money from Washington was an uncertain and tedious process, not one which would secure reliable funds. To fund all the liaisons planned for the JCTP was unthinkable. The final nail in the coffin of the program as it was then might be termed psycho-political. It was based on fear and mistrust of the United States. EUCOM attempting to extend the JCTP to the CIS, the nine plus Republics loyal to Russia, was being stone-walled. An interest was overtly expressed, but no approvals seemed to be able to be secured, which could only be the result of clandestine rejection by Russia. The JCTP was giving the wrong impression. The CIS did not want Americanization, and certainly did not want a longer-term American presence. It appeared as though the Americans wished to take the place of the Soviet Union. Russia was having second thoughts. The JCTP was at an impasse. Partnership Program solution The solution to the impasse, as far as it could be solved, was already within the JCTP. Success was a matter of its being recognized by the senior officers. It had begun as an attempt to add the Baltic states to the list of prospective hosts. An MLT was already partly established in Hungary, the first host country. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Poland were deferred pending their achievement of stability. Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania were next, to be followed by the Baltic states. Meanwhile, NATO was not waiting for the United States to solve its impasses. At its July, 1990, Summit Meeting, it had determined to extend \\"the hand of friendship\\" to the Eastern Bloc. Over the course of the next year, a new organization was proposed, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) to include Warsaw Pact and CIS nations. Its Charter was presented at the 1991 Rome summit in November. By providing mutual consultation services it would smooth over and help to stabilize the end of the Soviet Union. Its first meeting, on December 20, 1991, was interrupted by a message informing the Soviet ambassador his country did not exist any longer. Latvia had belonged to the NACC from its very beginning. As the reputation of the JCTP began to spread, Latvia made an unusual request in July, 1992, to the NACC, with which it was familiar, rather than to the JCTP itself. It wanted to join, but it did not want the coaching of an active United States Army unit. Instead it passed the word to the NACC that it would prefer a National Guard unit. This was a surprise because in the past Latvia had recruited some of Europe's best elite professional troops, such as the Latvian Rifles. There were but few in Latvia who remembered them. They fought for the Tsar, then for the Bolsheviks. Detained subsequently in Russia, most never got home again. The military needs of all the Baltic states are far different now than they were in 1915. The states are too small to put up much of a defense as individual countries; moreover, the terrain is mainly indefensible. Any defense force could be easily outflanked by a larger army.Membership in a larger organization is their main defense. Of the many sources available on the topic, one gives a public analysis from a NATO point of view: It is true that the retreating army of the 3rd Reich for a time formed a redoubt on the Kurland Peninsula, but it had no hope of victory, and was forced to surrender. It is also true that the extensive forest of the Valdai Hills in adjoining Russia gave shelter to various successful partisan groups. Wars are not won by partisans alone. The Latvian Rifles only fought for Latvia as units in the Tsar's army. They were expected to hold their sector of the Eastern Front, but as the war retreated from there, so did they. Baltic military experts, still expert, were perfectly familiar with these well-known circumstances. The Latvians did not therefore plan for more than a token professional army as a sort of inner guiding corps. With the defeat of the Russian coup in August, 1991, they knew that they would be allowed to rebuild a military. Their very first unit of August was the Latvian National Guard, a contingent of citizen-soldiers. They were not first of all outsiders. They would be defending the country in which they were born and raised, nor could any foreign power remove them from there for missions not their own. Second, they were needed to work with civilian authorities for solving domestic problems of security and order. The requirement did not fit the mold of mil-to-mil associations; therefore, they requested an American unit that could work with civilians. The DoD response to a request from the new Latvian Republic through the JACC for assistance building a National Guard called Zemessargi, \\"Land National Guard,\\" to distinguish it from the previous Aizsargi, \\"National Guard,\\" which had served the German occupation army until its dissolution by the Soviets in 1945, developed from suggestion to real beginning between January and November, 1992. Learning by some means that the JCTP would need a Guard unit, John B. Conaway, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, wrote to Colin Powell offering the services of the United States National Guard. Having already taken the initiative to develop a Guard solution to the impasse, he had been waiting for some such opportunity as this. He, Vance Renfroe (a senior officer in the ANG), Wayne Gosnell (a senior officer in the ARNG), Max Alston (Army Reserve, retired), and staff, had been planning a new form of assistance, later to be called the SPP. For now, it was simply \\"the Baltic initiative.\\" In retropect, Air Force Col. Joey Booher, Chief of International Affairs for the NGB, said: ‚ÄúThe U.S. was trying to engage with the former communist nations that were in the Warsaw Pact, and using active duty troops might have been a little too offensive to the Russians or the folks that were in there, so the idea was to use the small footprint of National Guard troops.\\" The \\"small footprint\\" also included an economic smallness. The Boehm source reports that \\"In the United States, it had been shown that operating a standing army costs 80 percent more than a reserve element. The plan was considered complete in January (even though the best was yet to come). Conaway was able to write to Powell, \\"The National Guard stands ready to advise and assist in the formation of U.S.-style National Guard military structures in the countries of the former Soviet Union, the Baltic Republics and the former Warsaw Pact, and to assist authorities in cooperative self-help projects to enhance democratization and stabilization of the countries of the region.\\" Powell replied on 24 January, \\"I appreciate your insights and offer of assistance. Your expertise will be invaluable as we enhance our contacts with the former Soviet-bloc countries.\\" In a conference of February 18, Conaway further explained that possible areas of cooperation included \\"civil affairs,\\" and \\"teams for cooperative humanitarian or civic assistance projects.\\" He suggested the employment of \\"personnel with civilian sector skills.\\" These paternalistic goals went far beyond the usual combat role of soldiers and were not aptly described by \\"mil- to-mil contacts.\\" To support them Conaway used the description \\"a decentralized system of deployable resources\\" without any necessary implication of military resources. On April 1 Dick Cheney added \\"humanitarian assistance\\" and \\"crisis management\\" in an address to NATO at Brussels redefining U.S. goals for East Europe. He was careful to reassert that these were roles of the military: \\"Helping to build democracy through the appropriate roles for European militaries including civilian command, a hallmark of Western democracies.\\" Some weeks after, the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm received a letter from the Latvian Deputy Minister of Defense, Valdis Pavlovskis, inviting USCOM to assist Latvia in implementing the deployable reserve. The show was on, so to speak. It was to be presented to the three clients that November in a special visit of select top DoD officials to the Baltic capital cities. It was not complete yet, the most characteristic feature developing at the last moment. The NGB published a paper on November 4 referring to \\"the Baltic Initiative\\" of the JCPT. As a sort of afterthought, it suggested that each Baltic country be assigned a \\"partnership state,\\" the Guard of which would take charge of mil-to-mil (or mil-to-civilian) exchanges. Shortly the suggestion became a full-blown proposal of the program, with Michigan to be assigned to Latvia, Pennsylvania to Lithuania, and less certainly New Jersey or New York to Estonia. Maryland was the final choice for Estonia, based on the existence of a large Estonian immigrant community there, who could provide bilinguals. The NGB called these relationships \\"sustaining partnerships.\\" In the last few weeks of November, 1992, a visitation of 38 interagency dignitaries alighted upon the Baltics by air with full authority to unroll the program as persuasively as they could. They had no authority to implement it. The delegation included Lieutenant General John Conaway, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, and Brigadier General Thomas Lennon, head of the JCTP. They were very persuasive. All three Baltic states signed on enthusiastically, professing a readiness to start immediately. The delegation was not ready to start. First it must acquire authority from the United States Government, which, apparently, was cautiously testing their interest. Encouraged by the success of the mission, the IWG approved the SPP on 27 January 1993. Subsequently, the DoD changed the traditional reserve role of the Guard for this case, to permit it to undertake \\"an active component mission.\\" John Shalikashvili, head of EUCOM, briefed NATO and Russia's military, to avoid any sudden changes that might be misinterpreted. Having completed these steps, he added his approval in March. The State Department was asked to arrange the details through the ambassadors. Conaway gave the final NGB approval on April 27, after which the process, finally considered approved, moved rapidly. So far the dignitaries on both sides had planned and communicated but no active partnership had taken place. Finally in April the first members of the MLT for Estonia arrived in Tallinn with members of the New York NG. The MLT for Latvia, including members of the Michigan NG, arrived in Riga in early May, a few days after the Estonian team in Tallinn. Uniformed Russians were still in the country. Some of the Estonian clients had recently been officers of the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian MLT was the last to arrive, in Vilnius, in mid-May, bringing a few members of the Pennsylvania NG. These delegates were planners. It was their task to set up joint events. The concept meanwhile was vending itself. By July 14 nine more paper partnerships were added, to be physically realized in 1994. They included three of the CIS: Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus. Later Belarus had second thoughts. The non- paper beginning of the SPP as a distinct program therefore is counted by the major Internet military sources as April, 1993, with Estonia taking the lead by a few days. It was not the first effort in the collusion direction. It did modify the first effort, which was the JCTP. It had already taken practical measures the year before. A TCT had been sent to Hungary in October, 1992. An MLT was started in Poland in February, 1993. These early JCTP countries converted to the SPP in the summer of 1993, not necessarily with a change of personnel, as the institutions of the JCTP were turned to the SPP. Global expansion of the SPP Having been recognized as a success under EUCOM, the SPP was in demand by other republics of the world in a variety of different security and humanitarian crises. The United States' response was to import the program to the five other Commands. Not all five existed at the time. The growth of the SPP is a sideshow (albeit an important one) of the growth of the new military signalled by the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, which put aside a long but often troublesome military tradition in favor of centralization, quick response, efficiency of joint operations (which nearly all were) and accountability. The act was one substantive answer to all questions of imperial presidency or any quasi-autonomous functioning of military or intelligence units.  Reorganization of the military  The immediate trigger of the change was the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981, which began with the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran by radical Islamic students (and others) contrary to International Law. On April 24, 1980, a military rescue operation was launched, Operation Eagle Claw, authorized by President Jimmy Carter, which never arrived in Tehran, but ended in the desert, with some accidental loss of life. The expedition was troubled by poor planning, bad communications, and bad luck. It did not have enough momentum to carry through. The failure ended the careers of the officers in charge, but the consequences reached much further. The American public had before it a paradigm of how a hostage extraction should be conducted in Operation Entebbe on July 4, 1976. Airline passenger hostages were removed from an African airport after the defeat of their captors. The rescuing Israeli commandos simply flew into the airport in a surprise attack. The fact that their much more powerful and resourceful nation could not stage a reasonable facsimile was something of a scandal to Americans and a topic of ridicule to their allies. There were also rumors of inordinate spending, with inflated prices being set for everyday cheap items. The new President Reagan did not hesitate. In 1981 he initiated a from-the-ground-up investigation of the entire military by the Packard Commission. They were to look into the root causes of inefficiency and ineffectiveness and make recommendations to remedy them. They finished in 1985. Their recommendations were incorporated into the Goldwater- Nichols Act of 1986. The Packard Commission reported that the lack of communication and lack of cooperation came from a lack of \\"a rational system\\" rather than from criminal conspiracy or incompetence. Their analysis was primarily a business one, which was to be expected, as their numbers were culled from corporate leaders. In business, questions of system are primarily addressed by changing the management. In the DoD the management were the service chiefs, whose acronyms were preceded by CINC, \\"commander-in-chief.\\" The Commission was recommending that they be taken out of the chain of command, popularly known as being \\"fired,\\" and replaced by a \\"rational system.\\" Accordingly, the Goldwater-Nichols Act summarized the independent actions of units that were supposed to be operating jointly under the terms \\"inter-service rivalry.\\" Because of it, no joint system could be developed. As remedy, it altered the regular chain of command of the services by removing the Joint Chiefs of Staff from it. Henceforward the former commanders of the armed services were to be only an advisory body to the President. The term CINC was dropped. Their importance in strategic planning was just as great as ever. Their authority, however, had been centralized and placed in another. The CJCS was made the President's chief military advisor. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau also was made a joint chief, taking away his command of the Guard and rendering him into an advisor. The NGB does not \\"command\\" the NG. The President alone was not given the additional power quasi-imperial. The post of Secretary of Defense was strengthened into the actual commander of the DoD. He (or she) must accept orders from the President. The President must have a Secretary of Defense, and must command through him. He must have been a civilian for at least seven years. Appointment to the position is subject to Congressional approval.

Early life Hedwig was born in Bra»ôov, Transylvania, on December 8, 1730. As the son of a shoemaker, he grew up in poverty. It was in his childhood he became fascinated with mosses.Isely, Duane. One Hundred and One Botanists. Purdue University Press, 2002. He went on to study medicine at the University of Leipzig, and received his medical degree in 1759.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johann-Hedwig Career Cover of Species Muscorum Frondosorum Plate from Species Muscorum Frondosorum After receiving his degree, Hedwig worked as a physician for the next twenty years. When he was not granted a license to practice in Transylvania with his Leipzig degree, he worked as a general practitioner in Chemnitz. It was during this time when he first pursued botany as a hobby. He would routinely collect samples in the morning before work, then study his accumulation in the evening. He also was gifted a microscope and a small library, courtesy of Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber. Hedwig was very skilled at both microscopy and biological illustration. He was able to identify and illustrate moss antheridia, archegonia and male gametes. He directly observed the germination of spores and formation of the protonema. He was less successful with other sporophytes, being unable to determine the life cycles of ferns or fungi, but he did make useful observations on the algae Chara and Spirogyra and he made it clear that he was not the first to get new plants from sowing the spores of mosses, David Meese having done it before him.Morton, A.G. 1981.

In 1781, he moved to Leipzig, where he worked as a doctor at the city hospital. It was here that he published his first major work, the two volume Fundamentum historiae naturalis muscorum frondosorum in 1782. In 1786, he was hired as an associate professor of medicine at the University of Leipzig. In 1789, he became a professor of botany and director of the botanical garden at the school. In April 1788, he was invited to be a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1790, he became a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1792, he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. His chief work, Species muscorum frondosorum, was published posthumously in 1801. It describes nearly all the moss species then known, and is the starting point for nomenclature of all mosses, except for the Sphagnum group.

After beginning her career touring in Italy and then England in grand opera, Roberts joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a principal soprano in 1938. She remained with that company for ten years, marrying another company member, the baritone Richard Walker, in 1944. After four more years of theatre in Britain, the couple moved to the US, where they presented Gilbert and Sullivan in two- person entertainments throughout North America. They then moved to Australia, where they joined the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company. They toured with Williamson in the late 1950s and early 1960s. They also appeared in musicals, including a four-year engagement in the original Australian production of My Fair Lady. After her husband's death in 1989, she returned to England. Early life and career Roberts was born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Her father was a surveyor for Lloyd's of London.Hoare, Colin.

Helen Roberts at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 16 December 2010. before her father moved Helen, her two sisters, Joan and Sheila, and brother Denis, to Naples Italy for five years immediately after World War I. She returned to England, to finish her schooling, and then studied music at the Royal Academy of Music, privately and later in Italy. She toured in Italy with the Milan Opera Company, singing the role of Norina in Don Pasquale by Donizetti. After returning to England, she toured in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffman as the Doll and Antonia and also sang briefly in the chorus of the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. In September 1938, Roberts was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a principal soprano.Rollins and Witts, p. 163 She began to perform there under the name Betty Roberts, but Rupert D'Oyly Carte soon asked her to change it to something more fitting to a leading lady, and she returned to her birth forename. During her decade of performing with the D'Oyly Carte company, she appeared regularly as Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance, the title character in Princess Ida, Elsie Maynard in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Gianetta in The Gondoliers. She soon added the role of Phyllis in Iolanthe to her repertoire. She sometimes also played as Yum-Yum in The Mikado and briefly played the title character in Patience.Rollins and Witts, pp. 163‚Äì72 This was the longest continuous D'Oyly Carte career of any of the company's principal sopranos.Rollins and Witts, passim. A few principal sopranos served the company over a longer span of years, but not continuously; a few women served for longer but did not sing the principal soprano roles continuously. The Times repeatedly praised her singing and appearance,See, e.g., \\"Princes Theatre, Gilbert and Sullivan\\", The Times, 16 June 1942; p. 2; \\"Princes Theatre, Iolanthe\\", The Times, 19 June 1942; p. 6; and \\"Sadler's Wells Theatre, Gilbert and Sullivan\\", The Times, 22 July 1947; p. 6. and The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the company's 1941 tour, wrote, \\"One of the chief pleasures of last night's performance was the lovely voice of Miss Helen Roberts.\\"\\"Pirates of Penzance\\", The Manchester Guardian, 14 November 1941, p. 6 During the war, she sang in concerts and on the radio in aid of public morale. Roberts married fellow company member Richard Walker on 31 July 1944. Earlier that month, the two found themselves very close to an exploding German rocket near Piccadilly Circus, as they approached a restaurant. They were not seriously hurt, but just before they went on stage that evening as Wilfred and Elsie in The Yeomen of the Guard, Walker proposed marriage.\\"Helen Betty Roberts Walker 1912‚Äì2010\\", The Palace Peeper, The Gilbert and Sullivan Society of New York, Vol. LXXV, No. 5, pg. 3, 5 July 2017.

After a year playing in other theatre in Britain (he returned for part of that time to D'Oyly Carte). Roberts and Walker also gave two-person concert tours of Gilbert and Sullivan throughout North America in the early 1950s, where they lived for several years.Ayre, p. 353 They then joined J. C. Williamson Limited to tour Australia and New Zealand. U.S. President Eisenhower asked the Walkers to give their concert programme at his pre-inauguration party at the White House following his re-election in 1956, but they were unable to travel from Australia to attend. The Williamson company played Gilbert and Sullivan for extended tours every few years into the 1960s, and Roberts reprised her D'Oyly Carte roles in these, adding the new roles of Plaintiff in Trial by Jury and Rose Maybud in Ruddigore. Roberts and Walker also performed in musical comedies in Australia under other management, including touring for more than four years in the original Australian production of My Fair Lady, beginning in 1959, in which she played Mrs. Eynsford-Hill (the mother of Eliza's suitor Freddy), and he played Eliza's father, Alfred P.

The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the \\"Ascended Master Teachings\\" as the Master of the Sixth Ray.Bailey, Alice A, A Treatise on Cosmic Fire (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237 It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was \\"Chohan of the Sixth Ray\\" until December 31, 1959, when, according to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of \\"Planetary Buddha\\" and \\"Cosmic Christ\\".Luk, A.D.K.

Previous incarnations According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the Prophet of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143 He did this in order to aid the white magicians in the war of the white magicians and the black magicians that was going on in Atlantis at that time. According to Alice A.

Ministry The followers of Benjamin Creme and Alice A. Bailey believe in the Nestorian/Gnostic Christology, promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater, which asserts that the powerful being known as the Maitreya overshadowed the Master Jesus during the Ministry of Jesus, such that there were two beings in one body. Maitreya was the Christ and the Master Jesus was Jesus of Nazareth; the combination of the two beings functioned as Jesus Christ.Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India: 1925-- Theosophical Publishing House Page 278Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission-- Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 64 Those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings believe in the existence of the Maitreya; however, they believe that although he encouraged the mission of Jesus, he did not actually overshadow Jesus.Prophet, Mark Studies of the Human Aura Colorado Springs, Colorado: 1975 - Summit University Press (Claimed to have been dictated from Kuthumi) Page 17 Crucifixion Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings alike believe that the Master Jesus underwent the fourth level of initiation (the crucifixion) at his crucifixion in Jerusalem. According to Alice A. Bailey, for most people at the fourth initiation the crucifixion is symbolic as a severe life test of renunciation, but for Jesus it was literal.Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922 Lucis Publishing Co. Page 89 Resurrection Ascended Master Teachings organizations adhere to the traditional Christian view that Jesus resurrected and ascended with his own physical body. Some with backgrounds in traditional Theosophy, the writings of Alice A. Bailey, and Benjamin Creme believe that Jesus resurrected from the body that he had when he incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, although they do believe he ascended on the 3 day‚Äîthey believe he had a body functioning at the fourth level of initiation when he ascended and not a fifth level body. Activities between the resurrection and the ascension Traditional theosophists believe that the Master Jesus and Maitreya souls' separated from each other just after the Ascension (which for Jesus was only to the fourth and not the fifth level of initiation) and do not believe that the Master Jesus went to Kashmir; they believe he went directly to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara, for a time, until he then incarnated again soon after as Apollonius of Tyana.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission--Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 152 It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that when Jesus ascended on the 3rd day after the resurrection, he levitated from Judaea to Kashmir. Day of Pentecost In either case, whether he went directly to Shamballa or to Kashmir when he ascended, presumably he teleported to a location above Judaea briefly ten days later on the 50th day after his resurrection in order to observe from afar the events of the Day of Pentecost (or possibly he observed these events by remote viewing). In both traditional Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings it is believed that these events were coordinated by the Maha Chohan, who, it is asserted by both C.W. Leadbeater and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth.Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 255Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 200 Activities after the day of Pentecost In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that the Master Jesus lived in Kashmir until he was 81, and then, assuming he had been born in 6 BC, in AD 75, he ascended to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, Sanat Kumara. Controversy regarding incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society, wrote in 1877: \\"Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an enthusiastic founder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical and more practical than Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, and the same high moral truths.\\"Helena P. Blavatsky: Isis Unveiled, vol. 2, New York 1877 (reprinted 1999), p. 341. Some Theosophists such as C.W. Leadbeater and the teachers of Neo-Theosophy, Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have written that the Master Jesus was also incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana after his incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed that he attained the fifth level of initiation (the resurrection) when he became an Ascended Master at the end of his life as Apollonius of Tyana. However, if Apollonius was a contemporary of Jesus as Blavatsky wrote, Jesus could not have reincarnated as him. Benjamin Creme gets around this by claiming that Jesus lived from 24 BC to AD 9 Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission Vol. I London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 382 (instead of the usual dates given of Jesus' lifetime as being c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33). This means that Jesus could have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, since according to Creme, Apollonius lived from AD 16 to c. AD 97.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission Vol. I London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 373 However, one of the possible chronologies of Apollonius of Tyana's life sometimes cited give his life span as being from AD 40 to AD 120,For the chronology of AD 40--AD 120 see Maria Dzielska: Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, Rome 1986, p. 30-38. thus making it possible that, even if the usual dates of Jesus' lifetime are accepted (c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33), he still could have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana. However, other modern scholarship, more often cited, gives the dates of Appolonius' life span as c. AD 15 to c. AD 100, thus making it problematic, realistically speaking, that Jesus could have incarnated as him.For the chronology of AD 15--AD 100 see Maria Dzielska: Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History, Rome 1986, pp. 30‚Äì38. Jesus' incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana is accepted by the followers of traditional Theosophy, of Alice A. Bailey, and of Benjamin Creme, but not by those who are adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, who believe that the incarnation as Jesus was his last embodiment on Earth. Incarnation as Ramanuja C.W. Leadbeater stated that the Master Jesus, after his resurrection in the body of Apollonius of Tyana, incarnated in India as the Tamil religious reformer Ramanuja, a leading figure within the Bhakti movement in Hinduism; thus, by incarnating as Ramanuja, Jesus became an Avatar. According to Leadbeater, the Master Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja as part of his spiritual work as Master of the Sixth Ray of Love-Devotion (bhakti is the Sanskrit word for devotion).Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India:1925 Theosophical Publishing House Page 239 That Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja is believed by many traditional Theosophists, but not by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings. Benjamin Creme's views According to Benjamin Creme, the Master Jesus visited the Americas (as well as Polynesia) not immediately after his resurrection as recounted in the Book of Mormon, but in the late 7th century and early 8th century, after having descended to the continent of America from his dwelling place in Shamballah with Sanat Kumara.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission--Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 378 Like the Mormons, Creme believes that this visit gave rise to the legend of Quetzalcoatl. Benjamin Cr√®me asserted that, in the late 1970s, the Master Jesus appeared to Spencer W. Kimball, then president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in the Washington D.C. Temple.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission--Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 304 Creme stated that since 1990 the Master Jesus has been living in secret in Rome.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission--Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 46 After Maitreya makes his Emergence (the Day of Declaration), Creme asserted, the Master Jesus in his immortal body will assume the papal throne for the next 2,000 years of the Age of Aquarius. Master Jesus' retreat According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Jesus has a sumptuous retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above Jerusalem called the Resurrection Temple. Often his mother Mary (now married to the Archangel Raphael, as noted above, and serving the Solar Logos with him in the solar corona) descends to serve with him at the Resurrection Temple doing sacred rituals and answering prayers. Twin flame Ascended Master Teachings groups describe the Master Jesus as having a twin flame (celestial spouse) named Lady Master Magda, one of whose two known incarnations was Mary Magdalene; the other was Aimee Semple McPherson.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Lady Master Magda Pages 196-200 John the Beloved According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Ascended Master John the Beloved, who was Jesus‚Äô best friend during his lifetime, has a retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above Arizona where he teaches a variety of white magic that involves the mastery of the elemental spirits governing the realms of earth, air, water, and fire. It is believed that the Master Jesus often teleports over to John the Beloved's retreat to say hello to his old friend.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 146-148 Aetherius Society In the teachings of the Aetherius Society, headquartered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, it is promulgated that since his resurrection, the Master Jesus has been dwelling mostly on the higher planes of Venus in order to work with the Master Aetherius, but when his presence is required, he teleports to or takes a flying saucer to Earth as needed.King, George, (1996) Contacts With The Gods From Space, Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, The Aetherius Society Sananda The noted Ascended Master Teachings teacher Joshua David Stone (whose organization, the I AM University, was originally headquartered near San Luis Obispo, California), began holding his Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings in 1996. Stone had begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the Master Jesus, under his galactic name \\"Sananda\\" (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with Commander Ashtar, flying with Pallas Athena in their own flying saucer within the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet as its Commander-in- Chief.Stone, Joshua David Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path). According to Stone, another name used by Commander Ashtar to denote his flying saucer fleet is \\"The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood\\".\\"The Ashtar Command\\", by Joshua David Stone: It is believed that Ashtar is originally from a planet called Ashtar, but he moved to Venus thousands of years ago. It is said that he formed the Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet at the beginning of the Atomic Age in 1945 and that in the early 1980s, at the behest of Sanat Kumara, Sananda (the Master Jesus) and Pallas Athena took over command of the fleet. Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings. According to the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Sheldan Nidle, who resides in the gold country in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California, the Earth base of the Ashtar Galactic Command is known as the New Jerusalem or \\"Shan Chea\\". It is a square rotating space station with artificial gravity in constant orbit around Earth on the etheric plane, with orbit distances varying from approximately to . It is a large space station with a population of thousands of etheric beings. In the center of this square space station is a sphere connected by four tubes to the square outer ring of the space station. This sphere houses the Inn of Heaven, the command headquarters of Sananda, Lady Master Athena, and Ashtar. There is also a smaller round space station called \\"Schare\\" or \\"Share\\", where the individual flying saucers of the fleet piloted by those at the higher levels of the fleet command hierarchy dock to receive their orders and review their missions. Within the Inn of Heaven is a private retreat for Sananda (the Master Jesus) in addition to his retreat above Jerusalem. The Master Jesus has a landing pad for his flying saucer at his Jerusalem retreat.Ashtar Command Crew website--Galactic Confederation Fleets-- Description of the components of the Ashtar Galactic Command by Lady Master Athena, dictated thru Sheldan Nidle 25 June 2002 and Littlejohn 8 February 1989; also Mike Quinsey, summarizing the early 1980s revelations of Tuella : Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light Lourene Altiery, also known as Karita to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from Joliet, Illinois who now resides in Sun Lakes, Arizona.

She also teaches that an alternate name used by Commander Sananda to denote the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet is The Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light.Altiery, Lourene (Karita) The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002 Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery): World Global Express‚ÄîLourene Altieri master link website: In addition, Lourene Altieri has revealed the names of and channeled information from some of the other prominent beings who she says travel with Commander Sananda, Pallas Athena, Ashtar, and Vrillon on the saucers of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet.

He might be from the Great White Brotherhood, which is also known as the Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, which is perceived as being a spiritual organization composed of those Ascended Masters who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but who still maintain an active watch over the habitable worlds. The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the Spiritual Hierarchy directly concerned with the evolution of our world), Beneficent Members from other planets. He may be connected to Modern Rosicrucianism and the Ascended Master Teachings, responsible for the New Age culture of the Age of Aquarius, and also to the UFO Religion Aetherius Society, whose headquarters is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, although the 26 November 1977 Southern Television broadcast interruption must have a connection with his disappearance. Lancelot is currently working with Jesus Christ and Ashtar in the Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light, Sub- Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet, \\"working towards raising the consciousness of humanity and uplifting the vibrations of planet Earth\\", Angels Teachings, The Master and the Path and is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth. Lancelot is said to be an extraterrestrial from the planet called Alcorn, which operates in the fourth sector of the Milky Way Galaxy ‚Äì Olega, Quadra. He is said to be the crowned Prince of Alcorn, but for some reason he ran away from his planet and since then he is trespassing on earth and lives secretly in Agartha; he is working with the celestial beings whom humans worship as God on earth. Lancelot has a Nordic/Angelic (human- like) appearance and originates from the system that orbits The Constellation of Pleiades. Hatonn and the photon belt According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of Rapid City, South Dakota, the work of Hatonn feeding information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the supercomputers at the \\"Galactic Hall of Records\\" is secondary to Hatonn's primary task (Hatonn is, she states, a Pleiadean), which is functioning as the liaison officer between Sanat Kumara and the Pleiadeans for the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate through the approaching photon belt.Hatonn and the Photon Belt:Four Winds10.com‚Äîwebsite of Anne Bellringer: Skeptical view The scholar K.

Mihirakula was a son of Toramana, both of Huna heritage, and ruled the Indian part of the Hephthalite Empire. Mihirakula ruled his empire from 502 to 530, from his capital of Sagala (modern-day Sialkot, Pakistan). According to Xuanzang, Mihirakula initially was interested in Buddhism, but after being insulted by Buddhist monks, he turned anti Buddhist. According to Buddhist texts, the Huna king Mihirakula was extremely cruel and barbaric.Mihirakula, Encyclopaedia Britannica He destroyed Buddhist sites, ruined monasteries, killed monkshttps://archive.org/details/wonderthatwasind00alba/page/266/mode/2up. Yashodharman and Gupta Empire rulers, in and after about 532 CE, reversed Mihirakula's campaign and ended the Mihirakula era. Etymology The name \\"Mihirakula\\" is most likely of Iranian origin and may have the meaning \\"Mithra's Begotten\\", as translated by Janos Harmatta.Janos Harmatta, \\"The Rise of the Old Persian Empire: Cyrus the Great,\\" AAASH Acta Antiqua Acadamie Scientiarum Hungaricae 19, 197, pp. 4-15. According to Harold Walter Bailey: \\"A name like Toramana and his son's name Mihirakula interpreted by North Iranian (and not by Western Iranian) are clearly Iranian\\". Description According to Krishna Chandra Sagar, the Huna king Toramana was cruel and barbaric, his son Mihirakula even more so, during their rule. Mihirakula had conquered Sindh by 520 CE, had a large elephant and cavalry-driven army. Mihirakula destroyed Buddhist sites, ruined monasteries, according to Sagar. Yashodharman, about 532 CE, reversed Mihirakula's campaign and started the end of Mihirkula era.Foreign Influence on Ancient India by Krishna Chandra Sagar p.216 Mihirakula issued coins, like the Kushana era kings, showing Oesho or Shiva, which suggests that he may also have patronized Shaivism. Other scholars state that there are many legends surrounding this era and historical facts are difficult to ascertain. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang (Hsuan Tsang) mentions Mihirakula as conquering Kashmir first, then Gandhara. He is also mentioned as attempting to conquer central and eastern India, but getting vanquished by Yashodharman and the Gupta king Narasimhagupta Baladitya. Mihirakula was captured during the war, but his life spared because Baladitya's mother intervened and argued against capital punishment. He returned to Kashmir, states the Chinese pilgrim, with treachery seized power, attacked Gandhara, then died within a few months. Cosmas Indicopleustes The 6th-century Alexandrian traveler Cosmas Indicopleustes states that the Hephthalites in India reached the zenith of its power under \\"Gollas\\", which is thought to be the same as Mihirakula from the last part of his name. Xuanzang \\"The Record of the Western Regions\\" by the 7th-century Chinese traveler Hs√ºan-tsang states that Mihirakula destroyed Buddhism and killed monks in Gandhara.Early Buddhist Transmission and Trade Networks by Jason Neelis p.168 Xuanzang wrote in 630 CE that Mihirakula had conquered all India. The Narasimhagupta Baladitya defeated Mihirakula who was finally captured by the Indian king, who later spared his life. Xuanzang states that while Mihirkula lost his conquest, his brother seized power in Kashmir and Gandhara. Mihirakula returned to Kashmir, with treachery seized the throne, attacked Gandhara but died within a year. Gwalior inscription The Gwalior inscription issued in the 15th regnal year created by Matricheta in a Surya temple, mentions Mihirakula. It confirms that Mihirakula reign had included Gwalior around 535 CE. Sondani columns inscription Mihirakula suffered a defeat by the Aulikara king Yasodharman of MalwaOjha, N.K. (2001). The Aulikaras of Central India: History and Inscriptions, Chandigarh: Arun Publishing House, , p.52 in 528, and the Gupta emperor Narasimhagupta who previously paid Mihirakula tribute.

He has been a pioneer in the use of Magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the neurochemistry of the brain and the development of novel analytical approaches to studying consciousness, including the first demonstration of the brain's small-world network properties using fMRI. In 2008, Dr. Apkarian proposed the theory that chronic pain is a form of emotional learning, which popularized the study of reward learning within the pain research field. Dr. Apkarian earned a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California and earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the State University of New York Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York. He is the brother of Vartkess A. Apkarian, a noted chemical physicist and laser spectroscopist at University of California at Irvine. Dr. Apkarian's early work with primate electrophysiology established that thalamic neurons can be physiologically characterized based on morphology and projections to the cortex, which led to the discovery that the thalamus dynamically encodes nociceptive stimuli in response to features of sensory stimuli. In the 1990s, his research transitioned to human brain imaging-based investigations of pain qualia and neural mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Dr. Apkarian's body of research was pivotal in establishing neuroplasticity as a mechanism of chronic pain, with notable findings including: in 2004 his group first identified grey matter changes related to chronic back pain, in 2008 his group first described resting state network changes in chronic pain patients and white matter abnormalities related to complex regional pain syndrome, and in 2012 his group published the first evidence that functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens prospectively predicts the development of chronic back pain. Much of this work was done in collaboration with Marwan Baliki, a research scientist at the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab (formerly Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago), and Paul Geha, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine. Dr. Apkarian's research has increasingly focused on the translation of neuroimaging findings to improve clinical treatment of chronic pain, include the development of preventative treatments and the strategic use of placebo treatment. This work should hopefully traverse through the alleviation of clinical pain conditions, as well as a more profound theoretical and mechanistic understanding of the brain. Criticisms of Dr. Apkarian's work include his focus on chronic low back pain, low rates of depression in his clinical cohorts, and emphasis on cortical mechanisms of chronic pain. Nevertheless, his use of rigorous statistical analyses, validation of findings in independent cohorts, replication of findings using multiple imaging modalities, use of longitudinal neuroimaging, and replication of key fMRI findings in rodent models of neuropathic pain have created a consistent body of research. Chronic pain Chronic pain is one of the biggest health problems in the world. In United States chronic pain costs the United States about $100 billion a year. As per Technology Review magazine: > \\"A. Vania Apkarian and his colleagues at Northwestern University have found > a series of abnormalities in the brains of chronic pain sufferers: the part > of the prefrontal cortex linked to decision making appears to have shrunk in > chronic pain patients. And another part of the prefrontal cortex linked to > emotion is hyperactive. In fact, a unique study assessing background pain in > chronic back-pain patients suggests that the constant pain these people > experience is linked to activity almost entirely in emotion-regulating parts > of the brain.\\" http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/19715/ According to Dr Vania Apkarian it is important to treat pain early to prevent any permanent changes or damages to the nervous system.

The series was produced by Universal Television and lasted five episodes. The series theme song, \\"Someday My Prince Will Come\\" (from Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) was written by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey, and was sung by The Roches. Synopsis The series chronicles the lives of three female roommates in New York City, each with a different background and upbringing, thus the series' title: Tracy Dillon (Julie Hagerty), an English teacher who just dumped her fiance after learning that he had been married twice and was still involved with one of his ex-wives (who also was his business partner); Princess Georgina \\"Georgy\\" De La Rue (Twiggy, credited as Twiggy Lawson, in her first American television series), a recently widowed English princess (and whose previous occupation was that of a showgirl) who arrived to the States to challenge her late husband's contested will; and Melissa Kirshner (Fran Drescher), Tracy's longtime best friend, an outspoken Jewish American who sold cosmetics at a department store. In addition to the three, there was also Melissa's sister Debra (Leila Kenzle). The idea of the three being roommates in the same apartment was by accident, thanks to the apartment's owner Tony, who promised Tracy and Georgy the use of the rent-free building without telling either one who would use it or to whom he had loaned it. Cast *Julie Hagerty as Tracy Dillon *Twiggy as Princess Georgina \\"Georgy\\" De La Rue *Fran Drescher as Melissa Kirshner *Leila Kenzle as Debra Kirshner * Robert Firth as Dr. Murray Lieberman Production and development In an effort to downplay the behind-the-scenes turmoil on Princesses, CBS execs initially touted the series as \\"promising\\" to advertisers. However, prior to the show's premiere, entertainment media outlets such as Entertainment Tonight began publicizing the show's behind-the-scenes woes. Princesses was problematic by the time it went into production. The first tell-tale sign came when Hagerty walked off the set after filming the first four episodes, which were followed by profoundly negative reviews, off-camera problems, and rumors that CBS affiliates might never air the episodes. Upon its premiere, Princesses placed last in the Nielsen ratings. At one point, CBS programming head Jeff Sagansky expressed interest in re-tooling the show and replacing all of the show's cast members. Drescher soon became aware of this and immediately arranged a meeting with Sagansky. During the meeting, Drescher tried to compromise with Sagansky by suggesting he only re-cast Hagerty's role. but CBS ultimately decided against Drescher's wishes and axed the entire show (only five episodes out of the eight produced were aired). Shortly after the cancellation, an accidental meeting gave Drescher a chance to pitch a new television series to Sagansky, and she came up with her hit show The Nanny. In fact, Drescher developed the idea for The Nanny while visiting with Princesses co-star Twiggy and her family in England, and modeled the character of Maxwell Sheffield on Twiggy's husband Leigh Lawson. Episodes Broadcast In 2010, TV Land aired the series as part of their TV Land Sunday Spotlight series. Reception The show ended up ranking 118th out of 132 shows that season, averaging only a 6.3 household rating.

The biblical text credits Joshua among the leaders that inspired a momentum towards the reconstruction of the temple, in Ezra . Later some of his sons and nephews are found guilty of intermarriage. Facts concerning the later part of Joshua's life are in part dependent upon whether Joshua was still alive at the time of his appearance in a vision seen by Zechariah. If the vision relates to Nehemiah's cleansing of the temple in then the engagement of Joshua's great-great-grandson to the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite would place Joshua in his late 90s if he were still alive.Carol L. Meyers Haggai, Zechariah 1‚Äì8 Vol. 25B The Anchor Yale Bible Commentaries 1987 Appearance in vision In the Book of Zechariah , Zechariah the prophet experiences a vision given to him by an angel of the Lord in which the restoration and cleansing of Joshua's priestly duties are affirmed. Included in the visions were requirements in which Joshua was expected to uphold. These included: (1) walk in the ways of God, (2) keeping the requirements (the law), (3) ruling God's house, (4) take charge of my courts; by fulfilling these duties, the angel in the Book of Zachariah granted access to the inner temple to Joshua and his fellow priest. The vision also functioned to purify Joshua and to sanctify him for the preparations of his priestly duties. Alternatively, if Joshua had in fact died before the events of Nehemiah 13, then it is possible that the vision intended to depict a heavenly throneroom scene of Satan and the angel disputing over the soul of Joshua, and the intended target of the allegory is the then serving high priest, his grandson, Eliashib.Meyers, op.cit.

His family relocated to the United Kingdom where he studied medicine and started his pioneering research. Career Pharmacological research Starting with khella, a traditional remedy for asthma, Altounyan discovered in 1965 that khella's active ingredient was khellin. He eventually produced a safer chemical based on khellin, sodium cromoglycate. This was later marketed as Intal by Fisons Pharmaceuticals, which was taken over by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, who in turn were acquired into Aventis and Sanofi- aventis. Prior to the RPR takeover, the R&D; element of Fisons was sold to Astra, making it now part of AstraZeneca. Sodium cromoglycate was the first clinically utilised mast cell stabiliser. The mast cell plays a key role in allergic and asthmatic inflammation. Mast cells contain powerful inflammatory mediators which when released lead to inflammation and bronchoconstriction of the airway. Sodium cromoglycate stabilises the mast cell thereby preventing the release of the mediators. The Ambicromil (Probicromil) patent also has his name on it and is from Loughborough, Leicestershire. This is a Benzodipyran structure. War service Altounyan joined the Royal Air Force in 1941 and became a flying instructor. He was regarded as an \\"exceptional\\" instructor of bomber pilots and in 1943 he was appointed to the staff of a school for flying instructors. He was awarded the Air Force Cross for developing new techniques in night flying. His flying experience is said to be the inspiration for the \\"spinhaler\\", a propeller-driven device to deliver sodium cromoglycate deep into the lungs. Swallows and Amazons During his childhood, the Altounyans visited their British grandparents (his grandfather was W. G. Collingwood) in the Lake District where they met the writer Arthur Ransome. Ransome named some of the primary characters in his famous book, Swallows and Amazons, after Altounyan and three of his four sisters; Roger became Roger Walker the ship's boy. Ransome later stayed with the family in Aleppo, bringing them a small dinghy to sail, and writing most of Peter Duck there.

He is Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. His works include The Poem's Two Bodies: The Poetics of the 1590 Faerie Queen, (Princeton UP, 1988); Dreams of the Burning Child: Sacrificial Sons and the Father's Witness (Cornell UP, 2003); three edited books; and about two dozen refereed articles that have appeared in scholarly journals such as Modern Language Quarterly, English Literary History, and Publications of the Modern Language Association. He is one of four general editors of The Collected Works of Edmund Spenser, a new scholarly edition under contract to Oxford University Press. Miller's work has been especially devoted to the canon of Edmund Spenser, a contemporary of Shakespeare's whose Faerie Queene is considered one of the two or three greatest epic poems in the language. Spenser was the subject of The Poem's Two Bodies in 1988, and Miller is helping to prepare a new scholarly edition of the English poet. In many of the articles, particularly in Dreams of the Burning Child, Miller ranges through ancient, early modern, and modern literatures and through both popular and high cultures to demonstrate the central thesis that Western culture is fixated on the sacrifice of sons as a means of shoring up patriarchal authority. Prior to moving to South Carolina, Miller taught at the University of Alabama from 1978 until 1994, and at the University of Kentucky from 1994 until 2004. After growing up in San Diego, California, he was educated at Yale University and the University of California, Irvine.

The film is loosely based on two short stories, \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\" (1845) and \\"The Premature Burial\\" (1844), by Edgar Allan Poe. It is also partly inspired by the works of the Marquis de Sade. The film was shot between October 2004 and April 2005, on location in the village of Peruc close to Prague, and in ≈†vankmajer's studio in the village of Knov√≠z. Plot summary Jean Berlot (Liska) is a deeply troubled man who has been haunted by violent hallucinations of being stuffed into a straitjacket by two orderlies since the death of his mother, who was committed to a mental institution before she passed on. While arranging his mother's funeral, Jean meets a fellow who claims to be the Marquis de Sade (Triska) and lives as if he's in 18th-century France rather than the 21st-century Czech Republic. Jean strikes up an alliance with the Marquis, though they can hardly be called friends, but is horrified by the Marquis' debauchery, namely the blasphemous orgy that Jean spies through an open window. The Marquis drops dead after choking on a banana the following day, and Jean is ordered at gunpoint to assist the servant Dominik (Nov√Ω) in burying the coffin in the family mausoleum. The next morning Jean and Dominik are awakened by a bell, and after opening the stone of the mausoleum, the Marquis reveals it had all been an elaborate prank. His mother had died after being buried alive, and he finds it therapeutic to relive this childhood memory that haunts him. The Marquis suggests a therapy that could help with Jean's nightmares: voluntarily committing himself to an asylum managed by his friend Dr. Murlloppe (Dusek), who offers \\"Purgative Therapy\\" for people who aren't mad but could be in the future. Jean falls for a beautiful nurse named Charlota (Geislerova), who claims she's being held at the hospital against her will, and reveals that Murlloppe and the Marquis were previous patients who led a revolt and locked the real asylum employees in the basement. The Marquis tells Jean that Charlota is a \\"nymphomaniac\\" and likes to tell complex fabricated stories as a form of foreplay. On the one year anniversary of their revolt, Murlloppe, the Marquis, and Dominik take Charlota with them for a ritual orgy, and Charlota tells Jean it's his only chance to free the staff. Jean finds them tarred and feathered in the basement, and releases the men, who waste no time in beating all the patients and shoving them back into their cells. Dr. Coulmiere thanks Jean for releasing them, and explains his philosophy that corporal punishment is key to treating mental illness by balancing the mind and the body, and that Murlloppe's idea of curing it with \\"freedom\\" is absurd. Murlloppe, the Marquis, and Dominik are tracked down and are each given severe punishments. Now that Charlota has been rescued, Jean expects to leave with her and get married, but Dr. Coulmiere won't permit Jean to leave until 8am, per the usual protocol. Jean has trouble sleeping, and seeks out Charlota for comfort, but her room is empty. He finds her in Dr. Coulmiere's room preparing for a night of sexual pleasures. This sets off one of his violent hallucinations, and Dr. Coulmiere eventually has to intervene. He orders the first round of corporal punishment treatment: two orderlies stuff Jean into a straitjacket and carry him away.  Cast  * Jan Tr√≠ska ... Marquis * Pavel Liska ...

It was written by Mitchell Kapner and stars Bruce Willis, Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Natasha Henstridge. Its story follows a mild-mannered dentist as he travels to Chicago to inform a mob boss about the whereabouts of his new neighbor, a former hitman with a price on his head. The film was produced by Morgan Creek Productions, Franchise Pictures, Rational Packaging, and Lansdown Films and was released on February 18, 2000. It grossed $13.7 million in its opening weekend and $106.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $41.3 million. It received mixed reviews from critics and has a 45% approval rating based on 100 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. It spawned a sequel: The Whole Ten Yards in 2004. Plot Nicholas \\"Oz\\" Oseransky (Matthew Perry) is a likable Quebec dentist from Chicago, but is hated by his wife Sophie (Rosanna Arquette) and mother-in-law (Carmen Ferland). Oz‚Äôs assistant Jill (Amanda Peet) jokingly asks him to name a price to have Sophie disappear. Oz meets a new neighbor, and realizes he is Jimmy \\"the Tulip\\" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), an infamous Chicago contract killer with a bounty on his head. Oz reveals Jimmy‚Äôs identity to Sophie, who is intrigued. Oz befriends Jimmy, and shares his unhappiness: his business partner, Sophie‚Äôs father, was involved with an underage boy and embezzled from the practice to pay off the boy‚Äôs family before committing suicide, leaving Oz deeply in debt. Oz returns home, where Sophie has arranged for him to fly to Chicago and share Jimmy's whereabouts with mob boss Janni Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), for a reward. Oz is reluctant but complies. Arriving in Chicago, Oz has no intention of giving Jimmy up. At his hotel, he meets Franklin \\"Frankie Figs\\" Figueroa (Michael Clarke Duncan), Janni's enforcer, and denies any knowledge of Jimmy, but is brought to Janni‚Äôs estate. He meets Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), Jimmy's estranged wife. Janni instructs Frankie to accompany Oz home and keep an eye on Jimmy until Janni and his men can take him out. At the hotel, Oz calls Jimmy to warn him, but is told Jimmy knows what Oz has done. Cynthia arrives and tells Oz that Janni and Jimmy both want each other and Cynthia dead to collect a $10 million trust ‚Äì ‚Äúthe whole nine yards.‚Äù Oz and Cynthia drunkenly sleep together, and he vows to protect her. In Canada, Frankie and Oz meet Jimmy, who reveals he and Frankie are planning to kill Janni and Cynthia. Jimmy explains Sophie tried to hire him to kill Oz, and he plans to lure Janni to Montreal. Jimmy offers to kill Sophie, which Oz declines. At work, Oz tells Jill everything. She reveals that she too is a contract killer, hired by Sophie to kill Oz, Jill liked him too much, however, and cancelled the hit. She demands to meet her hero, Jimmy, who enlists her help. Oz tries to call Cynthia, who is en route with Janni. When Janni's gang arrives at Oz's house, Cynthia warns Oz that Janni will kill him after killing Jimmy. The two watch as the gang walks into the ambush. Down the street, Sophie meets with another hitman (Harland Williams), but when he recognizes Janni and Sophie explains the situation, he heads for the house with a gun. Inside, Janni is distracted by a naked Jill; she, Jimmy and Frankie kill Janni and his men. Oz and Cynthia drive away as Jimmy also shoots Sophie‚Äôs hitman, much to Sophie‚Äôs horror, and discovers he is an undercover S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec detective. As they dispose of the bodies, Oz calls and suggests a deal to benefit everyone. At his office, he alters the dead detective‚Äôs teeth to match Jimmy's dental records, then sets his and Janni‚Äôs bodies on fire in Oz's car. Investigators find the remains and believe Janni and Jimmy are dead, and discover a recorder in the detective‚Äôs car; Sophie‚Äôs conversation about killing Oz sends her and her mother to prison, despite Sophie‚Äôs claim that Jill is the killer. Oz is cleared of suspicion, and Cynthia collects the $10 million, transferring it to Jimmy in exchange for her and Oz‚Äôs lives. While Cynthia and Jill, whom they just met face-to-face, are at the bank, Jimmy and Frankie take Oz onto a yacht. Jill urges Cynthia to split the money with her and run, leaving Oz to be killed by Jimmy, but Cynthia realizes she loves Oz and refuses to betray him, and Jill assures her it was a test; Jimmy wants to give Cynthia and Oz $1 million as a wedding gift. On the boat, Jimmy confirms that the money has been transferred. He points a gun at Oz, but shoots Frankie instead, explaining that Frankie, believing Jimmy had gone soft, would have killed them both. Oz attributes the softness to Jimmy falling in love.

Three species are currently recognized: C. roemeri (named after Friedrich Adolph Roemer), C. taqueti, and C. elegans. Their fossilized remains have been found in the Solnhofen Limestone of Bavaria, Germany, the \\"Purbeck Group\\" of northeastern Germany, and the Calcaires t√¢chet√©s of eastern France. History Fossil specimen of a young juvenile C. elegans The name Ctenochasma was coined by the German paleontologist Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in 1852, based on a single lower jaw full of closely packed teeth which he gave the species name Ctenochasma roemeri.von Meyer, C.E.H. (1852). \\"Ctenochasma Roemeri.\\" Pal√§ontographica, 2: 82‚Äì84 & pl. 13. A second species, C. gracile, was named by Oppel in 1862 based on a fragmentary skull.Oppel A. (1862). \\"√úber F√§hrten im lithographischen Schiefer. Pal√§ontologische Mitteilungen aus dem Museum des Koenigl.\\" Bayrischen Staates, ed. A. Oppel, vol. 1, pp. 121‚Äì125 & pl. 39. Stuttgart: Ebner & Sembek. However, a year earlier, another, more complete specimen probably belonging to the same species was described and named Pterodactylus elegans by Wagner. Because the species name elegans was named before gracile, the species is now known as Ctenochasma elegans. Another specimen originally attributed to a small or juvenile Pterodactylus, P. brevirostris (Wellnhofer's \\"example 29\\", which was later placed in its own genus Ptenodracon), probably represents a young juvenile Ctenochasma based on similar wing bone proportions that differ from the similar Aurorazhdarcho. An additional species, C. porocristata, was named by Paul de Buisonj√© in 1981. However, it was differentiated mainly by the presence of a crest along the snout, which has since been shown to be a feature related to growth or sex, rather than species. A fourth species of Ctenochasma was first described (but not named) by Philippe Taquet in 1972. A single specimen, consisting of a partial skull with complete brain case, was found in France and housed in the collections of the Saint-Dizier Museum. Detailed comparison to other Ctenochasma specimens in 2004 confirmed that it was a new species. In honor of Taquet's work on the specimen, Christopher Bennett named the species C. taqueti in 2007. Although researchers in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Bennett and Jouve, suggested that all these species probably represented growth stages on just one kind of Ctenochasma, in a more comprehensive 2007 study, Bennett demonstrated that three distinct species could be recognized based on the number and slenderness of the teeth, which varied across all growth stages. C. roemeri, the earliest species, is characterized by its relatively low number of only moderately slender teeth. The later C. taqueti had a moderate number of slender teeth, and the last species, C. elegans, had a high number of very slender teeth. These three species, arranged chronologically, probably represent a single evolutionary lineage in which the filter-feeding apparatus was gradually refined. Description Fossil skull of a subadult C. elegans Fossil specimen of a young juvenile C. elegans Ctenochasma is distinguished mainly by its numerous (over 400 in adults) long, thin, curved and closely packed teeth, which lined its elongated and narrow snout. The teeth were so closely packed that they formed a comb, and in adults they projected outward away from the jaws, forming a basket; traditionally, these are thought to indicate a filter feeding lifestyle, straining water through the teeth in order to capture and eat small invertebrates, but unlike the related Pterodaustro it lacks adaptations that would form a pumping mechanism. Instead, the spatulate profile formed by the teeth probably indicate a spoonbill-like lifestyle, increasing the surface area of the jaws in order to catch small prey. The snout curved slightly upward and was rounded at the tip, and the teeth were restricted to the front half of the jaws. The smallest species, Ctenochasma elegans, had a wingspan of only about . Ctenochasma is distinguished by its mouth which contained as many as 260 long, thin comb-like teeth. Adult Ctenochasma had a bony crest along the skull, though this is not found in juveniles. Comparisons between the scleral rings of both Ctenochasma elegans and Ctenochasma taqueti and modern birds and reptiles suggest that these taxa may have been nocturnal, and may have had activity patterns similar to modern nocturnal seabirds. This may also indicate niche partitioning with contemporary pterosaurs inferred to be diurnal, such as Pterodactylus and Scaphognathus. Compared to other ctenochasmatoids, it had larger wings, and may have displayed a flying style comparable to that of modern skuas. Classification Skeletal reconstruction Below is cladogram following a topology by Andres, Clark and Xu (2014). In the analysis, they recovered Ctenochasma within the family Ctenochasmatidae, more precisely within the subfamily Ctenochasmatinae, sister taxon to the tribe Pterodaustrini.

Linzi (), originally called Yingqiu (), was the capital of the ancient Chinese state of Qi during the Zhou Dynasty. The ruins of the city lie in modern-day Linzi District, Shandong, China. The city was one of the largest and richest in China during the Spring and Autumn Period. With occupying Linzi in 221 BC, King Zheng of Qin completed his conquest of the Chinese rival states and declared himself the first emperor of Ancient China shortly afterwards. The ruins of the ancient city were excavated in 1926 by Japanese archaeologists and in 1964 by Chinese archaeologists. Layout Linzi covered an area of around with the city built between two parallel rivers that ran north‚Äìsouth, the Zi River to its east and the old course of the Xi River to its west. Remains of city sewer passing underneath the former city wall The city was surrounded by a perimeter wall of rammed earth. The city consisted of an outer city and an inner city. The outer city wall reached a maximum of in base width, averaging between in width. The inner city wall reached a maximum of in base width. The city had a sewer and water supply system. The palace was located in the inner city, located in the southwestern corner of Linzi. A large rammed earth platform was found inside the inner city, commonly referred to as the Duke Huan platform. The remains of the platform measure and are high. \\"Seven broad avenues, some wide and over long, ran north-south and east- west, roughly forming a grid pattern. Four major avenues met in the northeast section of the city. This area yielded the richest cultural remains from the Western Zhou to the Han.\\" In the Records of the Grand Historian, the population of Linzi in the fourth and third centuries BC was said to be 70,000 households, with at least 210,000 adult males. Scholars today believe this was somewhat exaggerated. Jixia Academy The kings of Qi and the Qi state acted as patrons of the Jixia Academy (ca 315-285 BC) in Linzi, the earliest and largest (in its time) center of learning in China. The Academy, possibly named after the city gate (Ji) nearby, was made up of chosen scholars who received a handsome stipend from the government in return for advising the king on government, rites and philosophy. Among the Jixia Academy scholars were Mencius, Xun Zi (who taught Han Fei Zi and Li Si, among others), and Shen Dao. Tombs Sacrificial horse pit The ruins of the city are surrounded by over 100 tumuli, some as far as away. Many of the tombs around Linzi have been looted in antiquity. In pits near what is considered the tomb of Duke Jing of Qi, over 600 sacrificed horses have been found arranged in two rows. Erroneous DNA test An initial test of corpses from Linzi graves' mtdna claimed that their mtdna was found to be more similar to Europeans than modern Chinese. The mtdna was reexamined and the initial test was found to be wrong, with results showing European mtdna sharing no links to the remains found in the graves, and the study says it \\"highlight that ancient mtDNA data obtained under different sampling schemes and subject to potential contamination can easily create the impression of drastic spatiotemporal changes in the genetic structure of a regional population during the past few thousand years if inappropriate methods of data analysis are employed.\\" References External sources * Allan, Sarah (ed), The Formation of Chinese Civilization: An Archaeological Perspective, Ancient Chinese capitals Archaeological sites in China Chinese architectural history Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Shandong ","title":"Ancient Linzi"},{"id":"6447113","text":"The NGC 2841 group is a group of galaxies about 19.6 million light-years away from Earth.

He was born in Lynn, Massachusetts. College career A jersey honoring Tsioropoulos hangs in Rupp Arena. Tsioropoulos played college basketball at the University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. As a sophomore in 1951, he was a member of Kentucky's NCAA Championship team, which defeated Kansas State 68-58 in the Championship game. In the fall of 1952, a point shaving scandal involving three Kentucky players (a fourth player, Bill Spivey, a teammate of Tsioropoulos on the 1951 National Championship team, was alleged to have been involved in the scandal but denied the charge) over a four-year period forced Kentucky to forfeit its upcoming season, which would have been the senior year for Tsiroropoulos and future Hall-of-Famers Frank Ramsey and Cliff Hagan. The suspension of the season made Kentucky's basketball team, in effect, the first college sports team to get the \\"death penalty\\", which actually was nothing more than the NCAA asking members schools not to schedule Kentucky, and not mandating it. Tsioropoulos, Ramsey and Hagan all graduated from Kentucky in 1953, and as a result, became eligible for the NBA draft. All three players were selected by the Boston Celtics: Ramsey in the first round, Hagan in the third, and Tsioropoulos in the seventh. All three also returned to Kentucky for one more season, despite graduating. After finishing the regular season (one in which Tsioropoulos averaged 14.5 points per game) with a perfect 25-0 record and a #1 ranking in the Associated Press, Kentucky had been offered a bid into the NCAA Tournament. However, then-existing NCAA rules prohibited graduate students from participating in post-season play. The Wildcats declined the bid because their participation would have forced them to play without Tsioropoulos, Ramsey and Hagan, thus jeopardizing their perfect season. Tsioropoulos' #16 jersey was retired by his alma mater, and he is in the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career Tsioropoulos spent some time in the Air Force before joining the Celtics in 1956. As Tom Heinsohn's backup at small forward, Tsioropoulos played three seasons with the Celtics, winning NBA championships in 1957 and 1959. In 157 NBA games, he averaged 5.8 points per game. His best NBA season was 1957‚Äì58; in which he averaged 7.7 points per game. This season was the only one of his three NBA seasons in which he played in the playoffs; he averaged 6.3 points per game. That year, the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks (which also featured Tsioropoulos' ex-college teammate Hagan, who had been traded to the Hawks in the Bill Russell deal) defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals.

Oat milk has a creamy texture and oatmeal-like flavor, and is manufactured in various flavors, such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla or chocolate. Unlike other plant milks having origins as early as the 13th century, oat milk was developed in the 1990s by the Swedish scientist Rickard √ñste. Over 2017‚Äì2019, oat milk sales in the United States increased 10 fold, and one major manufacturer, Oatly, reported a three-fold increase in worldwide sales. By 2019, oat milk products included coffee creamer, yogurt, and ice cream. Oat milk may be consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or an allergy to cow milk. Compared to dairy milk and other vegan milk products, oat milk has relatively low environmental impact due to its comparatively low land and water needs for production.  History  Invention Soy milk predates all other alternative milks, including oat milk, both as a cultural and commercial product. Since the early 20th century, soy milk made its way from Asia to European and American grocery stores, initially as a dairy substitute due to lactose intolerance. The increase in consumption of soy milk since its global distribution created a large market for plant-based, non-dairy milks like oat milk. The first example of an oat-based plant beverage was in the early 1990s, when Rickard √ñste developed oat milk. √ñste was working as a food scientist at Lund University in Lund, Sweden, researching lactose intolerance and sustainable food systems, when he invented the drink. Soon after, √ñste founded Oatly, the first commercial manufacturer of oat milk.  Market expansion  The pioneer in commercial oat milk, Oatly, had its products in 7,000 coffee shops and grocery stores, as of 2019, but was not the only prominent oat milk producer. Oat milk can be found under brand names Oatly (Sweden), Pureharvest (Australia), Alpro (UK), Bioavena (Italy), Simpli (Finland), Vitasoy (Hong Kong), and Pacific (USA), among others. In 2018, global sales of plant milks, including oat milk, were US$1.6 billion, with a forecast of $41 billion by 2025. In 2018, there were numerous oat milk shortages from unprecedented demand in Europe and North America, highlighting the strong consumer demand for this product. To meet the American demand, Oatly opened a new factory in New Jersey in April 2019, producing per month of oat milk base, and announced plans for a Utah-based factory three-times larger to open in early 2020. In 2019, retail sales of oat milk in the United States were $29 million, up from $4.4 million in 2017. During 2020, oat milk sales in the United States increased to $213 million, becoming the second most consumed plant milk after almond milk ($1.5 billion in 2020 sales). Oat milk desserts, such as ice cream, yogurts, and coffee creamers, were common in 2019, with expanded uses in coffee shops, such as Starbucks, and growth into new markets, such as China. Growth in the oat milk market is partly attributed to its relatively low environmental impact, low land and water needs, and rising vegan dietary practices in developed countries.  Production   Processing  The production of oat milk is similar to that of most other plant milks. Unprocessed cereal grains, like oats, are indigestible due to their hard, outer hull; processing is also necessary to change the dry grains into a liquid. The procedure starts by measuring and milling the oat grains to break apart their outer hull. Then the grains are stirred in warm water and ground into a slurry. The slurry is treated with enzymes and heat to create a thick liquid oat base. Soaking and subsequently extracting nutrients from the oats have the most direct implications on the final milk product. Increasing the yield in this step may be assisted by chemical catalysts, enzymes, or an increase in temperature, all in order to remove nutrient molecules from the solid byproduct and incorporate them into the liquid. Chemical catalysts increase the pH of the mixture, enzymatic catalysts induce partial hydrolysis of proteins and polysaccharides, and higher temperatures increase reaction rates. Separating the liquid from the solid byproduct is a simple step achieved through decanting, filtration, and spinning in a centrifuge. Once the liquid product is separated, adding other ingredients, such as fortifying vitamins and minerals, or sweeteners, flavorings, salts, oils, and similar ingredients, forms the final product. Since unfortified oat milk is lower in calcium, iron, and vitamin A than dairy milk, these nutrients must be added in order for the end product to be a nutritional substitute of dairy milk. Homogenization and heat-treatments such as pasteurization or ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatments are used to extend the product's shelf life.  Challenges to processing  Because oat milk is produced by the disintegration of plant materials, the resulting particle sizes are not as uniform as bovine milk. This variation in particle size is due to the vastly different lipid and protein molecules. Decreasing particle size, improving particle solubility, and using hydrocolloids and emulsifiers are common ways to improve product quality via homogenization. Another problem posed by the natural composition of oats is their high starch content. The starch content (50‚Äì60%) is challenging during UHT treatments because of starch's relatively low gelatinization temperature. To overcome this, producers use an enzymatic hydrolysis of starch by alpha- and beta-amylase, producing maltodextrins which gelatinize at higher, more suitable temperatures. Fortifying oat milk with essential nutrients may include vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin B12, riboflavin, calcium, and protein. Veganism and environmental impact Since around 2015, interest for plant-based foods, in combination with concerns for animal welfare and low environmental impact, propelled consumption of oat milk. Compared to dairy milk and other plant-based milks, the oat milk manufacturing process produces small amounts of carbon dioxide and no methane (low greenhouse gas emissions), and requires relatively low use of water and land. Oat milk production requires 15 times less water than dairy milk and 8 times less than almond milk. Nutritional composition In comparison to cow's milk, oat milk is similar in total calories per liquid volume (per cup serving, 120 vs 149 calories for cow's milk), has half the protein content, somewhat less total fat, but only about 10% of the saturated fat content, and about 1.5 times the total carbohydrate (although simple sugars are half that of cow's milk). Cow's milk has no fiber, but oat milk has 2 g dietary fiber per serving. Calcium and potassium contents are comparable, although oat milk ‚Äì as for all plant-based milks ‚Äì may be fortified with specific nutrients during manufacturing. See the article Plant milk for details. It has a glycemic index of 69.  Uses  Oat milk is used as a substitute for dairy milk in custom coffee preparation and in fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir. Baristas claim that oat milk needs less steam than cow milk, froths favorably, is tasteful, rich, and creamy like cow milk, and effectively balances the acidity of espresso coffee. It has growing applications in coffee preparation at major coffee shops like Starbucks. Like other non-dairy milks, oat milk may be used as a substitute for dairy milks when cooking or baking.

El Campeon's origin story was told in the single issue book \\"The Night of a Thousand Luchadores\\" which was printed in the Amazing Joy Buzzards Vol. 2 #5 and drawn by comic book artist Doug Holgate. Over time there have been a few incarnations of El Campeon and the current one is estimated to be the fourth. Little is known about El Campeon's larger purpose. He is known to help people in their time of need. He is sometimes known to take the form of a Fox. Over the years his costume has also seen more than a few changes. He is afraid of midgets. El Campeon is brutal in battle, but easily distracted by edibles. El Campeon loves cereal, churros and donuts, and has been known to sleep for entire weeks at a time. El Campeon is summoned by the Amazing Joy Buzzards with the use of a magical amulet but as is evidenced in \\"The Amazing Joy Buzzards and the Christmas Troll\\" when Santa Clause uses a similar amulet we discover that there is actually more than one magical amulet that are capable of summoning him with the magic words.

Odessa Catacombs (–û–î–ï–°–¨–ö–Ü –ö–ê–¢–ê–ö–û–ú–ë–ò). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. The system of Odessa Catacombs consists of a network of basements, bunkers, drainage tunnels and storm drains as well as natural caves. The Catacombs are on three levels and reach a depth of below sea level. It is one of the world's largest urban labyrinths, running up to . Parts were used as air-raid shelters during World War II. Part of the tunnels, only under the city, were turned into bomb shelters in the Cold War. Such bomb shelters supposed to be refuge for civilians in case of nuclear strike or gas attack. In the 19th century, most houses in Odessa were built of limestone that was mined nearby. These mines were abandoned and later used, and widened, by local smugglers, creating a labyrinth of tunnels beneath Odessa. Stories of smugglers are part of urban legends about treasures hidden underground. Despite fairly plausible details, such stories can hardly be proved. Many of the tunnels under living areas were filled up with earth, concrete or sand by construction companies, and are no longer available. thumb Detachment of Molodtsov near Odessa Catacombs Description thumb The approximate topography of the Odessa underground labyrinth is unknown as the catacombs have not been fully mapped. It is thought that most (95‚Äì97%) of the catacombs are former coquina multilevel mines from which stone was extracted to construct the city above. The remaining catacombs (3-5%) are either natural cavities or were excavated for other purposes such as sewerage. As of 2012, there are more than 1,000 known entrances to the tunnels. Only one small portion of the catacombs is open to the public, within the \\"Museum of Partisan Glory\\" in Nerubayskoye, north of Odessa.Catacombs, Catacomb Museum - Museum of Partisan Glory, retrieved 13 December 2014 Other caves attract extreme tourists, who explore the tunnels despite the dangers involved. Such tours are not officially sanctioned because the catacombs have not been fully mapped and the tunnels themselves are unsafe. History The first underground stone mines started to appear in the 19th century, while vigorous construction took place in Odessa. They were used as a source of cheap construction materials. Limestone was cut using saws, and mining became so intensive that by the second half of the 19th century, the extensive network of catacombs created many inconveniences to the city. Entrance of catacombs in Moldavanka on Kartamyshevskaya street. The entrances of the catacombs have to be closed or controlled at all times to prevent children from entering. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, stone mining was banned within the central part of Odessa (inside the Porto-Franko zone, bounded by Old Port Franko and Panteleymonovskaya streets). During World War II the catacombs served as a hiding place for Soviet partisans, in particular the squad of Vladimir Molodtsov. In his work The Waves of The Black Sea, Valentin Kataev described the battle between Soviet partisans against the axis forces, underneath Odessa and its nearby suburb Usatove. In 1961 the \\"Search\\" (Poisk) club was created in order to explore the history of partisan movement among the catacombs. Since its creation, it has expanded understanding of the catacombs, and provided information to expand mapping of the tunnels. The city has a large population of over 1 million people, which some believe would benefit from the introduction of a subway system. The tunnels have been cited as the reason why such a subway system has never been built in Odessa. Since the beginning of the 21st century limestone mining has continued in the mines located in Dofinovka, Byldynka, and \\"Fomina balka\\" near Odessa. As the result of contemporary mining, the catacombs continue to expand. Accidental deaths There have been various reports of people walking into the catacombs, getting lost and then eventually dying of dehydration. Perhaps the most famous story dates back to claims made in 2009 by Ukrainian catacombs explorer Eugene Lata. Lata wrote a widely circulated online post stating that he and other explorers had found the body of a local student named Masha, who on New Year's Eve in 2005 had wandered into the catacombs with her friends after drinking. The group of friends, he wrote, had all stayed there overnight, then left the next morning, but abandoned Masha, either accidentally or on purpose, and she was unable to find her way out. The post featured a graphic photo of what appeared to be a decaying corpse in the catacombs, which Lata claimed was Masha's body. A 2015 investigation by Vice writer Mike Pearl, however, found no evidence that Masha had existed.

The strip has been in syndication since June 9, 1986, originally distributed by Tribune Media Services and now distributed by Martin's own Neatly Chiseled Features. The strip's main character is a balding, big-nosed man named Earl who is usually shown as married to a pretty blonde named Nadine and as the owner of a small white \\"wonder dog\\" named Weederman. However, there is no particular continuity in the strip from day to day; the characters may turn up in prehistoric times or in a futuristic spaceship, or in heaven or hell. Even in the strips set in contemporary times, Earl is depicted variously as a corporate executive, a working-class person, a prisoner, or a homeless beggar. Strips often illustrate recurring themes, such as \\"A Time to Worry\\" and \\"People Unclear on the Concept\\". \\"Mister Boffo\\" strips have been collected in the books Mister Boffo: Unclear on the Concept (1989) (), Mister Boffo: Shrink Wrapped (1995) (), Mister Boffo: The First Decade (1996) (), and Boffo (2008) (). Many of the cartoons have also been reprinted in the newspaper strip On The Edge which Martin does in partnership with psychologist Dr. Jon Carlson and which uses them as an opening visualization to personal counseling advice. The character's strangest appearance, however, was in the truly bizarre self- published single issue comic book Boffo In Hell (1995) co-drawn by the cartoonist's teenage son Jay Martin where lovable loser Earl Boffo is transformed into a realistically drawn Image Comics-style scarlet-suited satanic superhero and his little dog Weederman into a huge humanoid werewolf after a powerful giant alien wedding ring falls to Earth and jams itself onto Earl's skull like a metal headband. The powered-up pair then battle an escaped trio of overly-muscled genetically altered mutant psychopaths who they accidentally dispatch to the title netherworld where the dead villains promptly kill all the devil guards and take over, setting up the storyline for future issues that never saw print.

While lighting techniques offer flexibility in the level of detail and functionality available, they also operate at different levels of computational demand and complexity. Graphics artists can choose from a variety of light sources, models, shading techniques, and effects to suit the needs of each application.  Light sources  Light sources allow for different ways to introduce light into graphics scenes.  Point  Point sources emit light from a single point in all directions, with the intensity of the light decreasing with distance. An example of a point source is a standalone light bulb. A directional light source illuminating a terrain.  Directional  A directional source (or distant source) uniformly lights a scene from one direction. Unlike a point source, the intensity of light produced by a directional source does not change with distance, as the directional source is treated as though it is extremely far away from the scene. An example of a directional source is sunlight.  Spotlight  A spotlight produces a directed cone of light. The light becomes more intense closer to the spotlight source and to the center of the light cone. An example of a spotlight is a flashlight.  Ambient  Ambient light sources illuminate objects even when no other light source is present. The intensity of ambient light is independent of direction, distance, and other objects, meaning the effect is completely uniform throughout the scene. This source ensures that objects are visible even in complete darkness.  Lighting interactions  In computer graphics, light usually consists of multiple components. The overall effect of a light source on an object is determined by the combination of the object's interactions with these components. The three primary lighting components (and subsequent interaction types) are diffuse, ambient, and specular. Decomposition of lighting interactions.  Diffuse  Diffuse lighting (or diffuse reflection) is the direct illumination of an object by an even amount of light interacting with a light-scattering surface. After light strikes an object, it is reflected as a function of the surface properties of the object as well as the angle of incoming light. This interaction is the primary contributor to the object's brightness and forms the basis for its color.  Ambient  As ambient light is directionless, it interacts uniformly across all surfaces, with its intensity determined by the strength of the ambient light sources and the properties of objects' surface materials, namely their ambient reflection coefficients.  Specular  The specular lighting component gives objects shine and highlights. This is distinct from mirror effects because other objects in the environment are not visible in these reflections. Instead, specular lighting creates bright spots on objects based on the intensity of the specular lighting component and the specular reflection coefficient of the surface.  Illumination models  Lighting models are used to replicate lighting effects in rendered environments where light is approximated based on the physics of light. Without lighting models, replicating lighting effects as they occur in the natural world would require more processing power than is practical for computer graphics. This lighting, or illumination model's purpose is to compute the color of every pixel or the amount of light reflected for different surfaces in the scene. There are two main illumination models, object oriented lighting and global illumination. They differ in that object oriented lighting considers each object individually, whereas global illumination maps how light interacts between objects. Currently, researchers are developing global illumination techniques to more accurately replicate how light interacts with its environment.  Object oriented lighting  Object oriented lighting, also known as local illumination, is defined by mapping a single light source to a single object. This technique is fast to compute, but often is an incomplete approximation of how light would behave in the scene in reality. It is often approximated by summing a combination of specular, diffuse, and ambient light of a specific object. The two predominant local illumination models are the Phong and the Blinn-Phong illumination models. = Phong illumination model = One of the most common shading models is the Phong model. The Phong model assumes that the intensity of each pixel is the sum of the intensity due to diffuse, specular, and ambient lighting. This model takes into account the location of a viewer to determine specular light using the angle of light reflecting off an object. The cosine of the angle is taken and raised to a power decided by the designer. With this, the designer can decide how wide a highlight they want on an object; because of this, the power is called the shininess value. The shininess value is determined by the roughness of the surface where a mirror would have a value of infinity and the roughest surface might have a value of one. This model creates a more realistic looking white highlight based on the perspective of the viewer. = Blinn-Phong illumination model = The Blinn-Phong illumination model is similar to the Phong model as it uses specular light to create a highlight on an object based on its shininess.James F. Blinn (1977). \\"Models of light reflection for computer synthesized pictures\\". Proc. 4th annual conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques: 192‚Äì198. CiteSeerX 10.1.1.131.7741. The Blinn-Phong differs from the Phong illumination model, as the Blinn-Phong model uses the vector normal to the surface of the object and halfway between the light source and the viewer. This model is used in order to have accurate specular lighting and reduced computation time. The process takes less time because finding the reflected light vector's direction is a more involved computation than calculating the halfway normal vector. While this is similar to the Phong model, it produces different visual results, and the specular reflection exponent or shininess might need modification in order to produce a similar specular reflection.Jacob's University, \\"Blinn-Phong Reflection Model\\", 2010.  Global illumination  Global illumination differs from local illumination because it calculates light as it would travel throughout the entire scene. This lighting is based more heavily in physics and optics, with light rays scattering, reflecting, and indefinitely bouncing throughout the scene. There is still active research being done on global illumination as it requires more computational power than local illumination.Li, Hao (Fall 2018). \\"Global Illumination\\" (PDF). = Ray tracing = Image rendered using ray tracing Light sources emit rays that interact with various surfaces through absorption, reflection, or refraction. An observer of the scene would see any light source that reaches their eyes; a ray that does not reach the observer goes unnoticed. It is possible to simulate this by having all of the light sources emit rays and then compute how of each of them interact with all of the objects in the scene.Reif, J. H. (1994). \\"Computability and Complexity of Ray Tracing\\"(PDF). Discrete and Computational Geometry. However, this process is inefficient as most of the light rays would not reach the observer and would waste processing time.Wallace, John R.; Cohen, Michael F.; Greenberg, Donald P. (1987). \\"A Two- pass Solution to the Rendering Equation: A Synthesis of Ray Tracing and Radiosity Methods\\". Proceedings of the 14th Annual Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques. SIGGRAPH '87. New York, NY, USA: ACM: 311‚Äì320. . . Ray tracing solves this problem by reversing the process, instead sending view rays from the observer and calculating how they interact until they reach a light source. Although this way more effectively uses processing time and produces a light simulation closely imitating natural lighting, ray tracing still has high computation costs due to the high amounts of light that reach viewer's eyes. = Radiosity = Radiosity takes into account the energy given off by surrounding objects and the light source. Unlike ray tracing, which is dependent on the position and orientation of the observer, radiosity lighting is independent of view position. Radiosity requires more computational power than ray tracing, but can be more useful for scenes with static lighting because it would only have to be computed once.Cindy Goral, Kenneth E. Torrance, Donald P. Greenberg and B. Battaile,\\"Modeling the interaction of light between diffuse surfaces\\", Computer Graphics, Vol. 18, No. 3. (PDF) The surfaces of a scene can be divided into a large amount of patches; each patch radiates some light and affects the other patches, then a large set of equations needs to be solved simultaneously in order to get the final radiosity of each patch. = Photon mapping = Photon mapping was created as a two-pass global illumination algorithm that is more efficient than raytracing.Wann Jensen, Henrik (1996). \\"Global Illumination using Photon Maps \\" (PDF). Rendering Techniques ‚Äô96: 21‚Äì30. It is the basic principle of tracking photons released from a light source through a series of stages. The first pass includes the photons being released from a light source and bouncing off their first object; this map of where are the photons are located is then recorded. The photon map contains both the position and direction of each photon which either bounce or are absorbed. The second pass happens with rendering where the reflections are calculated for different surfaces. In this process, the photon map is decoupled from the geometry of the scene, meaning rendering can be calculated separately. It is a useful technique because it can simulate caustics, and pre-processing steps do not need to be repeated if the view or objects change.  Polygonal shading  Polygonal shading is part of the rasterization process where 3D models are drawn as 2D pixel images. Shading applies a lighting model, in conjunction with the geometric attributes of the 3D model, to determine how lighting should be represented at each fragment (or pixel) of the resulting image. The polygons of the 3D model store the geometric values needed for the shading process. This information includes vertex positional values and surface normals, but can contain optional data, such as texture and bump maps. An example of flat shading. An example of Gouraud shading. An example of Phong shading.  Flat shading  Flat shading is a simple shading model with a uniform application of lighting and color per polygon. The color and normal of one vertex is used to calculate the shading of the entire polygon. Flat shading is inexpensive, as lighting for each polygon only needs to be calculated once per render.  Gouraud shading  Gouraud shading is a type of interpolated shading where the values inside of each polygon are a blend of its vertex values. Each vertex is given its own normal consisting of the average of the surface normals of the surrounding polygons. The lighting and shading at that vertex is then calculated using the average normal and the lighting model of choice. This process is repeated for all the vertices in the 3D model. Next, the shading of the edges between the vertices is calculated by interpolating between the vertex values. Finally, the shading inside of the polygon is calculated as an interpolation of the surrounding edge values. Gouraud shading generates a smooth lighting effect across the 3D model's surface.  Phong shading  Phong shading, similar to Gouraud shading, is another type of interpolative shading that blends between vertex values to shade polygons. The key difference between the two is that Phong shading interpolates the vertex normal values over the whole polygon before it calculates its shading. This contrasts with Gouraud shading which interpolates the already shaded vertex values over the whole polygon. Once Phong shading has calculated the normal of a fragment (pixel) inside the polygon, it can then apply a lighting model, shading that fragment. This process is repeated until each polygon of the 3D model is shaded.  Lighting effects  A reflective material demonstrating caustics.  Caustics  Caustics are a lighting effect of reflected and refracted light moving through a medium. They appear as ribbons of concentrated light and are often seen when looking at bodies of water or glass. Caustics can be implemented in 3D graphics by blending a caustic texture map with the texture map of the affected objects. The caustics texture can either be a static image that is animated to mimic the effects of caustics, or a Real-time calculation of caustics onto a blank image. The latter is more complicated and requires backwards ray tracing to simulate photons moving through the environment of the 3D render. In a photon mapping illumination model, Monte Carlo sampling is used in conjunction with the ray tracing to compute the intensity of light caused by the caustics.  Reflection mapping  Reflection mapping (also known as environment mapping) is a technique which uses 2D environment maps to create the effect of reflectivity without using ray tracing. Since the appearances of reflective objects depend on the relative positions of the viewers, the objects, and the surrounding environments, graphics algorithms produce reflection vectors to determine how to color the objects based on these elements. Using 2D environment maps rather than fully rendered, 3D objects to represent surroundings, reflections on objects can be determined using simple, computationally inexpensive algorithms.  Particle systems  Particle systems use collections of small particles to model chaotic, high- complexity events, such as fire, moving liquids, explosions, and moving hair. Particles which make up the complex animation are distributed by an emitter, which gives each particle its properties, such as speed, lifespan, and color. Over time, these particles may move, change color, or vary other properties, depending on the effect. Typically, particle systems incorporate randomness, such as in the initial properties the emitter gives each particle, to make the effect realistic and non-uniform.

It is located north-west of the state capital, Sydney. At the , Stuart Town had a population of 487. The area around the town is rich in cattle farming and orchards, so the town serves as a service centre to that area. It has a public schoolIronbarks School and Catholic and Anglican churches. History The area now known as Stuart Town lies within the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people. The village was formerly called Ironbark and was established following the discovery of gold in the area in the early 1850s with the heyday of gold mining being in the late 1850s and 1860s. The gold attracted bushrangers to the area. It was renamed Stuart Town in 1879‚Äîwith the arrival of the Main Western railway from Sydney‚Äîafter Sir Alexander Stuart. It has benefitted from its proximity to Lake Burrendong. Stuart Town is often claimed to be the birthplace of the former New South Wales Premier Sir Robert Askin. In fact, he was born at Glebe in Sydney, but he did spend much of his childhood at Stuart Town. Its original name, Ironbark, is used in the Banjo Paterson poem \\"The Man from Ironbark\\".

In the late 1970s Patrick Pacheco took over the editorship from William Como and strived for a time to make the magazine a more serious critical monthly with a greater emphasis on quality writing, abandoning color printing inside and reducing photos to a few inches square. This was a reaction to Como's \\"eye-candy\\" thrust, but sales were low and in 1981 Louis Miele replaced him at the helm and returned to the full- color format with plenty of skin on show. It seemed however that the day was done for After Dark, perhaps because several newer magazines were now doing a better (and more explicitly targeted) job of appealing to the magazine's original readership, for Miele's incarnation of After Dark folded after only a couple of years, this time permanently.

(Volume 3 is thus actually the fourth volume.)Direct examination of the periodical.  Background  After Dark, founded by its first editor, William Como, and Rudolph Orthwine (both of Dance Magazine), covered a wide range of entertainment- or lifestyle-related topics. In addition to numerous articles on dance, topics ranged from a review of the stage production of the musical Hair in the December 1968 issue and an article on Shirley Bassey in the January 1972 issue, to a cover photograph and feature article on Donna Summer in the April 1977 issue. Other cover photos included Bette Midler (January 1973), Robert Redford (December 1973), Barbra Streisand (April 1975), Lauren Hutton (December 1976), Mae West (May 1977), Peter Allen (February 1978), Dolly Parton (April 1978), Jon Voight (April 1979), Christopher Reeve (October 1980), Lily Tomlin (February 1981), and Diana Ross (May 1981). Best sold issue was the February 1976 Issue with Zarko Halmic, Bonita George and Bo van den Assum on the cover. The May 1979 issue contained a profile of actor Philip Anglim, who originated the role on Broadway of John Merrick in The Elephant Man, a play by Bernard Pomerance.

Some of the advertising was not overtly gay; however, much of the advertising was for establishments or products that were well-known to gay men, or contained symbols often used to identify gay-oriented material, such as the Greek letter lambda. There was also an abundance of advertising for men's boutiques and clothing companies, especially those‚Äîsuch as International Male, for example‚Äîthat offered skimpy men's underwear or swimwear. Advertising for other products or services for gay men was explicit; for example, the ads for Hand in Hand Video, a gay pornography studio; The David Kopay Story, regarding former professional football player David Kopay's homosexuality;After Dark, February 1977, p. 83. and an ad for books by noted gay author Paul Monette, The Gold Diggers (containing the tag line, \\"Glittering, Glamorous, Gay\\"), and Lovers: The Story of Two Men, by Michael Denneny, described in the ad as \\"A poignantly true love story, with photographs\\".After Dark, May 1979, p. 16. The May 1979 issue included an ad for an organization simply identified as \\"GSF\\" titled, \\"No Man Should Be Without A Man!\\", which stated, \\"If you would like to meet warm, sincere gay men (and women) who are interesting in forming...relationships then it's time you find out about GSF.\\"After Dark, May 1979, p. 89. The issue also included an ad in its \\"After Dark Classified\\" ads for a \\"Gay Astrologer\\".After Dark, May 1979, p. 96. Other advertising was obviously intended for adult readers as well, presumably those with open minds. The February 1977 issue contained a half-page ad for the Harry Reems Legal Defense Fund. The ad appealed for funds for Reems' defense in two separate lawsuits for his participation in the pornographic films Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones.After Dark, February 1977, p. 89.

The feature also contained a tandem piece on rollerskating disco, \\"Boogie on Wheels\\".Pacheco, Patrick, \\"Raucous and Roller Disco: More than Dancing / Boogie on Wheels\\", After Dark, May 1979, p. 54‚Äì61. The magazine publishers acknowledged the magazine's appeal to the gay community, noting that the magazine \\"had gotten a following in the homosexual community seven or eight years before any of the current homosexual magazines came on the market.\\" Donald Embinder, a former advertising salesman for After Dark, went on to found Blueboy, an upscale adult magazine which has been called the gay answer to such straight titles as Playboy and Penthouse.  Erotic content  The magazine, intentionally or not, provided a level of homoeroticism by regularly using images of nude or partially nude men for its cover and article illustrations. Although some illustrations of partially clad or nude women were included at times, males comprised the majority of the subjects. Some of the illustrations related directly to the subject of the article, but others seemed to be used just for their nudity or partial nudity. A feature article in the February 1977 issue, \\"Musclebound for Glory\\", contained photos of bodybuilders, thus relating the illustrations directly to the topic of the article.

The illustration is one of several for an article about current events on Broadway, and consists of a narrative text as well as photographs of performers with brief summaries of their productions in the captions of the photos.Mewborn, Brant, \\"What's in the News: Broadway Buzz\\", After Dark, February 1977, p. 8‚Äì11.

In the rear the land becomes flat, tinted blue at the horizon Platte Clove, sometimes Plattekill Clove, is a narrow and steep valley in the Catskill Mountains of New York. The valley is situated between Kaaterskill High Peak and Roundtop Mountain to the north and Plattekill Mountain and Indian Head Mountain to the south. It is mostly in Greene County, although the lowest, eastern portions are in Ulster County. The stream that runs below is called Plattekill Creek. A few hiking trails go through the Clove including Devil's Path and Huckleberry Point Trail. The area hosts bicycle racing events.  Geography  Along with Kaaterskill Clove on the other side of Kaaterskill High Peak, Platte Clove is one of only two breaks in the Catskill Escarpment. A narrow, two-lane road that climbs along the clove's north wall is the only route through the valley. This road, called Platte Clove Road, runs from Blue Mountain Road / Harry Wells Road in West Saugerties in the southeast until Rt 23A in Tannersville in the northwest. The cliffs near the clove's head-wall have views of the nearby waterfalls ‚Äì but have also been the site of fatal accidents. The area of Platte Clove known as Devil's Kitchen got its name due to the fact that the region is exceedingly difficult and dangerous for hikers. It runs from the top of the Platte Clove valley down into West Saugerties. The area is known to have a lot of timber rattlesnakes and northern copperheads. The south side is known to have hollow ground where a person can fall through the ground into rock crevices. There are places where one can pull back a conifer branch and find a drop of over 100'. In one hiking accident a man died in a place called Hell's Hole, and it took emergency medical services personnel three days to remove his body.  History  In the early 19th century, early American artists were struck by the rugged, wild scenery of the clove and other locations in the northeastern Catskills. Depictions of this wilderness by Thomas Cole and others led to the artists being dubbed the Hudson River School. In winter 1970 the body of a man was found on the slopes below Platte Clove Road a short distance past where it is closed at that time of year, near West Saugerties just short of the Greene County line. He carried no documents that would have identified him. The cause of death four gunshot wounds inflicted two days earlier; police believe he was killed elsewhere and disposed of in Platte Clove. His clothing and other items led them to theorize that he was from outside the U.S., possibly Europe or Brazil, and had possibly been lured to the country to be killed by organized crime without attracting too much attention in his native country; some local mobsters were interviewed about the case but did not provide any information. He remains unidentified; the New York State Police continue to investigate the case under the name West Saugerties John Doe. In 2010, a man from the Albany suburb of Delmar lost his footing near one and fell 100 ft (30 m) to his death. On June 4 of the same year, Olivia Rose Belfiglio fell 100 feet from the top of a cliff and died at the bottom.  Hiking  Hiking trails that run through the area are Devil's Path and Huckleberry Point Trail. The Long Path, a 357 mi (575 km) long- distance hiking trail that starts near the George Washington Bridge and ends in Albany, is contiguous with these trails. It comes from the south via Devil's Path, continues on the Overlook Trail, heads south on Platte Clove Road for 860 ft (262 m) and then heads north on Huckleberry Point Trail.  Bicycle racing  The area is known for its bicycle racing traditions. The steepest section, which ascends up the side of the area called Devil's Kitchen, starts at the corner of Becker Road in West Saugerties and climbs 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in 2.1 miles (3.4 km) into Elka Park. This section is renowned as one of the hardest climbs in the United States. It has an average grade of 12% and a maximum grade of 31%. The climb is categorized as a Hors cat√©gorie climb, the hardest of all climbs, when including additional road heading further into Elka Park or eastward into West Saugerties. The Devil's Kitchen climb itself is classified as a Category 2 climb, due to its shorter distance. The climb is as challenging, or more challenging, than some of the toughest climbs in the Tour de France. Trucks and buses are banned from it throughout the year and all vehicle traffic is prohibited from it from November 1 to April 15, during which time it is not maintained or plowed. The Tour de Trump bicycle race was routed through here, and the road proved so steep that even some of the top bicyclists in the world had to get off and walk their bikes (it was raining that day). It also features prominently in the annual Tour of the Catskills bike race. Aurelien Passeron, who won the 2010 Tour of the Catskills, said the climb was steeper than Col du Tourmalet in the Tour de France, Verbier, or even Mont Ventoux, but was shorter.

The movable bridges are on the Riihim√§ki‚ÄìSaint Petersburg Railway and link the railway networks in the north of St Petersburg with those in the south of St Petersburg. The same singular name is applied to both of the bridges. History The first bridge was built in 1910‚Äì1912 by the engineers Nikolay Appolonovich Belelyubsky, Grigory Grigorievich Krivoshein, I.G. Aleksandrov and the architect Vladimir Petrovich Apyshkov. The bridge was primarily funded by the Grand Duchy of Finland because of the strategic value it delivered by connecting the Finland railway and the Finnish State Railways with the Russian Railways system. In 1983, the reefer (refrigerated) ship ' hit the bridge while transporting a cargo of 500 tonnes of vendace fish. The ship sustained a hole in its hull and sank several hundred metres downstream in middle of the Neva river, halfway to the Alexander Nevsky Bridge. During 1983‚Äì1987, a second bridge, on the downstream side, was constructed parallel to the existing bridge by the engineer O.Y. Rusin. The spans of the new bridge followed the contours of the existing bridge arches. The central moving section of this second bridge is single-leaf bascule. Pedestrians and cyclists are banned from crossing the bridge on anti- terrorism grounds. Engineering The structure the bridge is closely related to the Bolsheokhtinsky Bridge. The same construction solution was also used in the design of the railway bridge across the Daugava River in Riga. The bridge was constructed as a steel bridge, carrying two rail tracks and a pedestrian path. The bridge design consists of four equal-width arched spans, each long, surrounded by a pair of abutment spans and with a central draw span in the middle. The movable section was initially a twin-leaf bascule bridge design and later converted to a single span vertical-lift bridge. The entrance to the bridge from the left bank passes through a concrete multi-span viaduct built during 1911‚Äì1913 by the Danish company Christiani. On the right bank, the bridge is approached via a metal overpass. In 1988, the old bridge was closed to traffic because of serious corrosion damage. By 1994 the pivot span and turning machinery of the old bridge were dismantled. In the period 2002‚Äì2003, a complete overhaul was carried out on the old bridge related to the construction of the Ladozhsky Rail Terminal with a total value of around 900 million rubles. During overhaul a new pivot span and turning machinery were mounted and the supporting bridge towers underwent renovation‚Äîthe supporting piers of the bridge were substituted by new ones. The bridge's footings were strengthened by installing a reinforced concrete coating using falsework plates and underwater concreting. Additionally, the adjoining metal overpass was completely overhauled with the replacement of 43 pillars and the corresponding 42 spans. All the construction and repair work had been completed on January 2003. Bridge lift times the bridge lift occurred once per night, between 02:20‚Äì05:30 in the morning, allowing a window for taller ships between 02:40‚Äì05:10. River navigation during the summer runs from 20 April‚Äì20 November each year, with a slight variation depending on the exact weather conditions. The times for the bridge lift remain constant during a particular navigation season, with slight alterations made every few years as necessary.

Before opening the club, Sanford Kellman had an impromptu party there and found that all the neighbors complained about the noise. Therefore, Sanford Kellman was required by the City government of San Francisco to soundproof the entire building at great expense, delaying the opening of the club for several months.Diebold, David Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon Northridge, California:1986--Time Warp Publishing--Pages 144 On the opening night of the club in October 1977, groups of bare-chested men in jeans and construction hats carried I-Beams on their shoulders into the club. Dancing, DJs, Music, Clubs, and Events at the I-Beam The I-Beam began as a seven night a week club in 1977. The City Nightclub was previously located in the North Beach district. As the crowd left the I-Beam for the newer clubs South of Market such as The Trocadero and later on Dreamland, the I-Beam opened only for five days a week. Randy Schiller who built the new sound system for the club was operating a recording studio where he had a long list of bands recording in his studio decided that we should reopen on Monday nights which started \\"Monday Night Live.\\" with local bands. It has an origin as a gay disco run by Dr. Sanford Kellman, a former astronomer. Throughout the 1980s, the upstairs space was the top outlet in the city for \\"imported modern rock\\". Inside the I-Beam the main room was forty feet by sixty feet. There were Mylar covered cardboard I-Beams hanging from the ceiling above the center of the dance floor. At the entrance there were framed pictures of various astronomical objects such as galaxies and planets put there by former astronomer Sanford Kellman. Randall Schiller installed an award-winning sound system including lighting and later, video. There was a large room in the front near the entrance with pinball machines and pool tables. Friday and Saturday nights at the I-Beam hosted heterosexual dance parties later on. The club hosted I-Beam Sunday Night Tea Dances, which took place from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Sunday night. Free passes to this popular tea dance were routinely handed out in San Francisco. Michael Garrett was the first dj to play there when it opened in 1977, immediately after which Tim Rivers was hired and played Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday nights. Eventually, a Sunday Tea Dance was added and Tim played the opening hours, 4 - 8 pm, after which Steve Fabus took over the 'tables. Steve played at the Sunday Night Tea Dance from 1977 to 1980. From 1980 to its end in 1992 Michael Garrett was the primary DJ‚Äîhe played modern rock dance music by artists such as Madonna, Prince, New Order, The Cure, R.E.M., Nine Inch Nails, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, etc. Guest DJs Micheal Dinella and Jim Caldwell frequently created original remixes on the impressive DJ equipment. In January 1988 three go-go boxes (cubes four feet square with a black and white checkerboard pattern of squares one foot by one foot on top; thus the surface of each go-go box had a checkerboard pattern of 16 black and white squares) were installed. The Boy Club continued until the end of 1988. From 1988 to 1992 events were held at the club. Beginning in 1988, there was a hip-hop dance club that appealed to the African Americans in the neighborhood. In 1989, the year rave dances first started in San Francisco, Wednesday night became Acid house Night at the I-Beam. Starting on 28 July 1980 with The Lloyds and Ultrasheen, New Music Night was instituted on Monday night, and later Tuesdays at which emerging new rock groups played. With the temporary closing of The Fillmore Auditorium following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the I-Beam was able to book many bands that would otherwise have played the larger venue. Because of this the club was featuring live music up to four nights a week, usually Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, with the occasional Sunday afternoon 'matin√©e' performance (a legendary Butthole Surfers show, among others). On Monday, November 14, 1988, The Escape Club performed, marking the only time a band with the current number one record on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ('Wild, Wild West', week of Nov. 12, 1988) played at the club. Monday nights became known as Monday Night Live! started by Randall Schiller and was originally booked by Alan Robinson and then Randy persuaded his employee Cathy Cohn to take over the booking, a KUSF DJ. After Cathy and Randy left, the booking duties for the club were handled by Anita Rivas, and eventually Eddie Jennings. Randall Schiller installed the latest EAW Loudspeaker system in the I-Beam as he was the first to introduce EAW to the Bay Area as a long time dealer for the product. End of the I-Beam The I-Beam closed in 1994 after a long battle with neighbors over sound issues. Live rock music shows over the last few years were few and far between. The Sunday Night Tea Dance continued until July 1992, but the last year had few patrons because by that time house music had become more popular than modern rock among gays who liked to go dancing. New Wave City, San Francisco's First & Foremost 80's Dance Party, presented its \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" event at the I-Beam on the last night of the I-Beam's operation, July 23, 1994. After the I-Beam closed, the building (originally the Park Masonic Hall), remained vacant and boarded up for 10 years until 2004, when it was torn down and a modern apartment house with retail shops at street level was constructed on the site.

He grew up in Stockholm, Sweden, and became a US citizen in 1992. Career Arno's stage pickpocket performance is billed as comedy, though it includes some non- comedic elements which, nevertheless, fascinate and impress audience members. First among these is his incorporation of documentary-style video which is projected during his presentation. As described in a March 9, 2004 article in The New York Times, the video is footage shot by himself and his wife, Bambi Vincent, of criminal pickpockets and other street thieves before, during, and after committing their crimes. This \\"reality factor\\" contributes greatly to the presentation's originality and adds elements of awe and enlightenment that give it depth beyond comedy. Unlike most other performers in the small, specialized field of pickpocket entertainment, Arno does not present magical effects for their own sake. He does incorporate principles of magic in much the same manner that criminal pickpockets, con artists, and other street thieves do. And, given that his show is comedy, he is not above preparing a volunteer on occasion to enhance his humorous finale. Regardless, Arno's thievery skills are legendary. Blue Moon Talent Agency says \\"Nothing a victim possesses is safe from Bob Arno's lightning lifts.\\" He has perfected the art of the steal to include neckties, suspenders, glasses, belts, cell phones, wallets, and pocket contents, as well as watches. Criminology In 1993, looking to expand the show, Arno and his wife, Bambi Vincent, challenged themselves to bring elements from the street to the stage. They began a serious study of street criminals, filming them in the act of tricking and/or stealing from victims, and interviewing them when possible. \\"Wearing hidden camera and recording equipment, they do everything they can to put themselves in the thick of the action,\\" according to Las Vegas Review Journal. Arno and Vincent began calling themselves \\"thiefhunters\\" and soon amassed a valuable film archive of a (then) little-documented crime. In the preface of their book (see below), Arno and Vincent claim to have initially suffered inner turmoil created by failing to prevent incidents occurring in their presence, but they overcame that discomfort after realizing the value of their study. Certainly they were able to port street techniques to the stage, as originally intended. But the video footage and interviews garnered interest from law enforcement and security agencies, while the video mixed with anecdotes and lessons became a popular lecture to laymen. Bob Arno Thus began Arno's career as a criminologist and speaker. His study had begun much earlier with observations of soldiers on R&R; leave in Asia during the 1960s. On May 11, 1969, a front page profile written by Brian Moynahan in the London Sunday Times called Arno \\"one of the world's pickpocketing experts.\\" In the four-column article Arno describes theft risks peculiar to various Asian countries and compares victim reaction by nationality. In its June 20, 1969 issue, Time magazine wrote: \\"One of the world's foremost experts in the techniques of first-rank 'wires' (or 'cannons' or 'pit workers') is Bob Arno, a 29-year-old Swede whose demonstrations onstage and in nightclubs earn him more than $100,000 a year.\\" In a January 9, 1981 article entitled \\"Beware the Stiff-Armed Stranger; He May be Lifting Your Wallet,\\" The Wall Street Journal quoted \\"Robert [sic] Arno, a Miami, Fla., pickpocketing expert who's advised police in various countries.\\" In 1993, armed with video cameras to document his findings, Arno revived his research in earnest. His knowledge base started with common and specialized forms of street thievery, and later grew to include off-the-street theft from tourists. His expertise now includes behavior profiling, identity theft, laptop theft, credit card fraud and internet scams. He lectures to corporate and lay audiences and presents training workshops for law enforcement and security, and other government agencies in the United States and abroad. Promenade Speakers Bureau calls Arno's presentations \\"a tad provocative,\\" and says they include \\"pattern recognition\\" and \\"body language profiling.\\" In December 2015 he was invited to speak at Europol's International Pickpocketing Gangs Conference in The Hague. Arno \\"was invited as a guest speaker, presenting pickpocket techniques as well as an insight in the countermeasures and tactical behaviour of the offenders\\" to law enforcements specialists from across Europe. With Vincent, Arno is co-author of the book Travel Advisory: How to Avoid Thefts, Cons, and Street Scams (Bonus Books, 2003). The feature article \\"Thieves Among Us\\" in the April 2005 issue of National Geographic Traveler documents several of Arno's \\"unorthodox surveillance tactics.\\" Arno walked into the picturesque but crime-ridden Spanish Quarter of Naples, Italy, to see how long it would take for his (fake) Rolex to be stolen by scooter- riding bandits. By alleging to be a pickpocket, he establishes a rapport with street thieves, which has resulted in at least one offer to join an organized crime ring at US$1,000/day for himself and Vincent. History At age 15, Arno began performing magic at youth centers in his native Sweden and was successful enough to tour the country for several years. He briefly experimented with hypnotism before settling on pickpocketing, having been inspired by french entertainer \\"Dominique\\" Risbourg, the reigning pickpocket performer of the time. When Dominique had an extended run in Stockholm in 1956, he solicited the local Magic Circle for an assistant, and Arno volunteered. On starting his pickpocket career Bob said: From age 20 to 23, Arno toured Asia with his pickpocket show, working nightclubs and U.S. military bases. From 23 to 25 he toured across Europe working nightclubs and theaters. At 25 he worked for two months at the Latin Quarter (nightclub) in New York City, which began his career in America. He worked steadily from then on, mostly in casino revues, moving from Atlantic City to the Caribbean to Canada to Las Vegas. In 1992, after many years in Las Vegas and three years (1990‚Äì1992) in the Jubilee! show at Bally's Casino there, he quit his casino revue career to travel with his wife. Cruise ships served a triple purpose in the 1990s: a steady income as a performing venue; exotic world travel; and putting Arno in the middle of huge tourist crowds, which is generally where pickpockets operate. These crowds, primarily in the great cities of Europe, but also in Asia, Africa, and South America, were the inspiration for Arno's research on criminal pickpocketing. The study soon became the motivation for further cruise ship engagements. The 1990s also saw Arno in theater productions. He starred in his own show with Swedish comedy magician John Houdi at Berns Salonger in Stockholm, performed at the Lido in Amsterdam, at Liseberg and Gr√∂na Lund in Sweden, at theaters in Sydney, and at Sun City, North West. He also began performing at private corporate events, which is currently his main focus along with keynote speaking and law enforcement training. In 2008 he toured as part of a stage show called Hoodwinked with Banachek, Todd Robbins and Richard Turner. He was featured in the Just for Laughs Comedy Tour of 2010, along with Jeremy Hotz, Robert Kelly, Ryan Hamilton, and Gina Yashere. In 2011, he was featured with Ben Seidman in a series of hidden camera videos directed by Jamie Kennedy and Michael Addis. Using their pickpocketing skills they slipped computers into people's handbags without them knowing. The \\"I Was Framed\\" project, gained online popularity and quickly reached over 900,000 views. In August 2015, he was a featured speaker at DeceptiCon 2015 at University of Cambridge, UK, the International Conference on Deceptive Behavior and deception detection. In December 2015 he was an invited speaker at Europol's International Pickpocketing Gangs Conference in The Hague, The Netherlands. Film The National Geographic documentary film Pickpocket King was shot in Naples, Italy in September 2010, and premiered around the world (region by region) in 2011 and 2012. Conceived and directed by Kun Chang, director, the film follows Arno as he meets and infiltrates the city's most prolific pickpocket gang. Once a relationship is established, the thieves challenge Arno to steal in the real world.

(Bob Arno is a contributor) Television Arno has appeared on numerous television shows in the United States and abroad, both as a performer and as an authority on street crime. Between 1972 and 1975, he had several of his own one-hour specials on TROS television in the Netherlands. On Late Night with David Letterman (December 1983) he stole Letterman's tie and heirloom watch. He was on HBO's Just for Laughs in 1989 and 2009. His 1996 appearance on World's Greatest Magic III revived interest in theatrical pickpocketing. As Arno's study of criminal pickpockets and con artists advanced, he appeared more and more frequently on national and local news shows around the world. Notable were his highly-rated (and repeated) segments on ABC's 20/20 (November 3, 2000, June 22, 2001, July 30, 2004, July 13, 2012, March 23, 2013). In Arno's early appearances on ABC 20/20, he narrated his crime-in-action video and walked the news crews through popular travel destinations where they became the victims of pickpockets and con artists. Those segments launched an entirely new genre in television, in which street thieves were filmed with hidden cameras and then confronted. In the space of three years, Arno made the two early 20/20 broadcasts, and many, many others including: * ITV London Weekend Television's Beware: Pickpockets, broadcast in June 2000 * ITV London Weekend Television's Beware: Street Thieves, broadcast in July 2001 * The Travel Channel's Las Vegas Caught on Tape, broadcast January 17, 2002 * The Travel Channel's Travel Scams & Rip-offs Revealed, broadcast December 3, 2002 * Court TV's Safety Challenge, broadcast March 13, 2003 * Jimmy Kimmel Live, broadcast June 2, 2003 The \\"beware of thieves\\" genre thus became popular. When, for some productions, Bob Arno was unwilling or unable to demonstrate pickpocket techniques and license his crime-in-action video, actors were assembled to dramatize scenarios without his expertise. With his pickpocket footage, demonstrations, and expertise, Arno also appeared in the BBC's History of Magic (2004), and appeared as \\"the fastest fingers\\" on Ripley's Believe it or Not (2003 Episode 4.9). The Travel Channel's endlessly repeated Travel Scams & Rip‚Äîoffs Revealed-Las Vegas, garnered consistently high ratings. Just for fun, Arno appeared on NBC's \\"Little Big Shots Forever Young with Steve Harvey\\", which aired on July 19, 2017 to a rousing standing ovation. Arno's foreign television credits are many, including appearances in Germany, Sweden, South Africa, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Canada, Slovenia, Brazil, India, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom.

Biography Hoyt was born in Concord, New Hampshire. He had a difficult childhood, as his mother died when he was nine years old. He graduated at the Boston Latin School and, after being engaged in the cattle business in Colorado for a time, took up newspaper work, first with the St. Albans (Vt.) Advertiser, and later becoming musical and dramatic critic of The Boston Post. Beginning in 1883, Hoyt turned playwright and wrote a series of 20 farcical comedies (roughly one per year until his death) and a comic opera. Hoyt's plays emphasized individualized characters drawn from the everyday experiences of ordinary people. His 10th play, A Trip to Chinatown (1891), with its hit tune \\"The Bowery\\" and its then-record 657 performance run, and his 1883 play, A Milk-White Flag, were the most successful. Both were performed at Hoyt's Madison Square Theatre in New York, often called simply \\"Hoyt's Theatre\\" during the seven years he ran it. He was a highly popular playwright and producer, and was very financially successful, thanks in part to the assistance of his business partners, Charles W. Thomas and Frank McKee. A Parlor Match (1884), adapted from a vaudeville act, was another popular Hoyt play. Hoyt was the 19th-century playwright who did the most to combine baseball with his love for the theatre. Besides having covered Boston Beaneater baseball for The Boston Post, he was a member of the Boston Elks lodge, whose members included fellow theatrical-sports buff Nat Goodwin. In early 1888, Hoyt was responsible for the stage debut of Boston Elk-Boston Beaneater Mike \\"King\\" Kelly in his A Rag Baby, and for the first-ever star billing given to a ballplayer on the stage. The latter took place in 1895, with longtime Chicago diamond star Cap Anson drawing the distinction through his A Runaway Colt. Poster for A Milk White Flag (1894) Hoyt was also responsible for two of Kelly and Anson's lesser roles: At the end of the 1888 season, he gave Anson a bit part one day in the role of Monk in one of his new pieces; Anson wore \\"old gray whiskers and an old man‚Äôs wig\\" and stalked forth and shouted, \\"Good marnin, me min; I want yez to git that hole complaited [completed] to-day.\\" Those were all of his lines, and New York and Chicago players were present. Around Christmas that year, and then New Year‚Äôs Day of 1889 in New York, Kelly played a \\"tough baggage-smasher\\" in Hoyt‚Äôs A Tin Soldier. Kelly was dressed as a tramp, and some of his lines concerned a character named Rats. When someone said to him, \\"Do have that Rats licked. I‚Äôll give $10 to have that Rats licked,\\" Kelly replied, \\"Make it $15 and I‚Äôll lick him.\\" Later, when someone said, \\"Do it well and I‚Äôll make it [$]25,\\" Kelly replied, \\"Young feller, I‚Äôll blot him off the earth.\\" Hoyt, once considered one of the most famous citizens of Charlestown, New Hampshire, was twice a member of the New Hampshire Legislature and was Democratic candidate for Speaker. Both his first wife, actress Flora Walsh, and his second wife, actress Caroline Miskel, died after only a few years of marriage. The death of his second wife in 1898 led to Hoyt's being committed to an insane asylum in 1900. Although his stay was brief, he returned to his home in Charlestown, New Hampshire, and died four months later.

The Grand nightclub after remodeling The Trocadero Transfer was an after hours dance club in San Francisco from its opening in December 1977 to the late 1990s. It was located at 520 4th Street at Bryant in the SoMa neighborhood. In 2000, the club was bought by a new owner, remodeled, and renamed to the Glas Kat. In late 2011, the club was again remodeled, and the name was changed to The Grand. History The Trocadero Transfer was founded by Dick Collier. The club stayed open on Saturday nights until 6 a.m. The entire Golden Gate Business Association (San Francisco's Gay business association) had to go down to the San Francisco Board of Permit Appeals to make sure that the Trocadero got its after hours license, and even then it was a while before the club was allowed to serve alcohol after hours. Diebold, David Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon Northridge, California:1986--Time Warp Publishing Page 128 People came to the Trocadero after the I-Beam closed at 2 a.m., and after the Trocadero closed at 6 a.m., those who still wanted to dance could after 1980 go to The EndUp, which opened at 6 a.m. Sunday morning. Description of the dance space Somewhat off-center of the dance floor, there was a narrow metal spiral staircase with clear plastic arms that went up from the dance floor to the balcony above where people could watch the dancers below. This spiral staircase was sometimes called The Crystal Staircase. (\\"Crystal Staircase\\" is a slang term used by gay African Americans. It refers to situations where someone has an easy life [someone who is born wealthy, has received a large inheritance, has gotten a job that is a sinecure, etc.]. Of course, crystal also refers to methamphetamine, which many patrons of the club took to stay up all night dancing.) Gender illusionists made a great show of ascending or descending the crystal staircase. Hanging from the ceiling at the center of the dance floor, there was the hypnotic mirror ball cluster--about a dozen mirror balls of various sizes which continually spun around and were the focus of the dance floor. Diebold, David Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon Northridge, California:1986--Time Warp Publishing Page 129--picture of the hypnotic mirror ball cluster DJs Some of the DJs who played at the Trocadero included Bobby Viteritti (the primary DJ at the Trocadero when it was at its zenith from 1978 to 1981), Diebold, David Tribal Rites:San Francisco's Dance Music Phenomenon Northridge, California:1986--Time Warp Publishing Page 154 Patrick Cowley, Gary Tighe, Michael Whitehead, Michael Lewis, Billy Langenheim and Rex Bailey on Lights, Steve Smith, Ralph Zepeda, Rob Kimbel, Lester Temple, Michael Garrett, Robbie Leslie and Steve Fabus. Craig Morey was Bobby's opening DJ (playing early in the evening) in 1980 and 1981. Brad Blair, primary DJ at Studio One in Los Angeles in 1979, played there on August 22, 1982. Joseph Watt played there as well, bringing a rock sound to the club. Disco parties There were many disco parties (the smaller, local one-night predecessors in the late 1970s and during the 1980s of what became after 1990 the much larger multi-day circuit parties) at the Trocadero. The names of some of these parties were the White Party (held Easter weekend), the Black Party (held the weekends before Walpurgis night and Halloween, at which many danced in skimpy black leather outfits), and the Red Party (held the weekend before Valentine's Day). At the height of the AIDS epidemic, because fewer people were going out dancing, from 1987 to 1989, the Trocadero was partially closed down and only hosted Disco Parties and special events. Clubs (1989-2000) In the spring of 1989, at the suggestion of Steve Fabus, San Francisco gay dance party promoter Gus Bean began his first house music club at the Trocadero, the Crew Club. A couple of times in the early 1990s, San Francisco's first massive rave, the Toontown Club was held at the Trocadero. The Bondage a Go-Go fetish club began on Wednesday nights in early 1993 and continued at the Trocadero until 2000, when it moved to the Cat Club on Wednesday nights at 1190 Folsom Street near 8th Street. In 2004 it moved back to the Glas Kat (the successor nightclub to the Trocadero at 520 4th Street). In 2011, due to the remodeling, the Bondage a Go-Go moved back to the Cat Club again and has remained there ever since, deciding to remain there instead going back to the Grand Ballroom. The other long-running club at the Trocadero was Death Guild, which moved to the Troc in 1992 from the Pit (after one night at DNA). This gothic industrial club ran on Mondays and continued until late 2008 (when it returned to DNA, although it was briefly replaced at the Glas Kat by a now-defunct club called Deathwish), and also in the mid-1990s spawned a theme camp at Burning Man of the same name, widely known for its Thunderdome, first built in 1999. In 1995 and 1996, the Temple Club, a gay nightclub, was held at the Trocadero Transfer on Saturday nights. Nostalgia parties since 2000 When the Trocadero was remodeled in 2000 and renamed the Glas Kat, the Crystal Staircase was removed. Before the Glas Kat remodel, a large birdcage-like go-go dance cage resided on a corner of the stage in the club since 1989. In the mid 1990s, a second similar cage was hung from the ceiling. In early 2007, the original cage was hung on the ceiling. In 2009, the cage was taken out. From 2000 to 2011, a number of Trocadero Transfer disco nostalgia events were held at the Glas Kat. These are called the Play Party and the Remember the Party parties. At these parties, the original sound of the Trocadero in the late 1970s and early 1980s was reproduced by today's DJs (the Glas Kat had go-go boxes to dance on, which did not exist in the original Trocadero). Some DJs played at the Remember the Party party who played at the original Trocadero Transfer during the 1980s. http://www.remembertheparty.com/review-20040418.shtml Notable performers * AFI * Claudja Barry * Angela Bofill * Taka Boom * Boys Town Gang * Pattie Brooks * Jocelyn Brown * The Call * Jean Carne * Charo * Cheap Trick * Linda Clifford * Course of Empire * Crash Worship * The Dickies * Dio * Divine * Dub Narcotic Sound System * Exodus * Einstuerzende Neubauten * First Choice * The Flirts * Fugazi * Taana Gardner * Gary's Gang * Gloria Gaynor * Edwin Hawkins * Nona Hendryx * Loleatta Holloway * Thelma Houston * Information Society * Switchblade Symphony * Chris Isaak * Debbie Jacobs * France Joli * Grace Jones * Madleen Kane * Chaka Khan * Eartha Kitt * Patti LaBelle * Lime * Marilyn Manson * My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult * Edith Massey * Armistead Maupin (reading excerpts from Tales of the City) * Ullanda McCullough * The Mighty Mighty Bosstones * Misfits * The Mr. T Experience * Jackie Moore * David Naughton * Negativland * NOFX * Dennis Parker * Paul Parker * Prong * The Queers * Fonda Rae * The Raes * Sharon Redd * The Ritchie Family * Vicki Sue Robinson * David Lee Roth * Marlena Shaw * Slayer * Gino Soccio * Candi Staton * Swervedriver * Sylvester * Teenage Fanclub * The Three Degrees * Tool * Jeanie Tracy * Train * Luther Vandross * The Village People * The Weather Girls * Mary Wells * Viola Wills * Neil Young * Pia Zadora See also * Trocadero ‚Äì a San Francisco road house, gambling joint, and dance hall that existed from 1892 to 1930.

It stands on high ground overlooking the Tywi Valley with extensive views. It was built in about the 1220s by one of the princes of the kingdom of Deheubarth, and changed hands several times in the struggles between the Welsh and English over the ensuing centuries. It is considered one of the most important remaining structures built by a Welsh chieftain and is a Grade I listed building.  Castle of Deheubarth  Perched on the top of an isolated, rocky hill above the Towy Valley, Dryslwyn Castle occupies a splendid defensive position. It may occupy a spot previously used in as a fortification in prehistoric times but no evidence has been found to support this theory. In the twelfth century Rhys ap Gruffydd, often known as \\"Lord Rhys\\", reigned over the kingdom of Deheubarth and brought it a period of peace and stability. On his death in 1197, his three sons contested his inheritance and fought between themselves for supremacy. Neighbouring Welsh kingdoms and the English took advantage of this to infiltrate Deheubarth and it was around this time that Dryslwyn Castle was built. Drysllwyn Castle with Gronger Hill It is not clear precisely who built it, but it was probably constructed in the 1220s by one of the princes of Deheubarth, perhaps Rhys Gryg. In any event, the castle at Dryslwyn was, along with the neighbouring Dinefwr Castle, for a long time central to the security of the kingdom. It was apparently assaulted in 1246, because it was mentioned in an ancient chronicle Annales Cambrie, where a siege of the castle by the seneschal of Carmarthen was mentioned. He was apparently acting on behalf of its \\"rightful owner\\", but who that rightful owner was or whether the siege was successful is not known. It may have been that Rhys Gryg built the two fortresses of Dryslwyn and Dinefwr in order to provide legacies for his two sons after his death, which happened in 1234. The two castles are of very similar construction, with a round tower with flared base inside a ward enclosed by a curtain wall that contoured round the hillside. The ward contained a great hall and an adjoining building that was probably a kitchen. Between the hall and the curtain wall was an enclosed small structure that it has been suggested may have been a prison. The castle underwent a lengthy period of expansion in the late thirteenth century. After the death of the last native prince of Wales, Dafydd ap Gruffudd, in 1283, the castle was one of the few remaining substantial stone castles in Wales to be held by a Welshman; the most prominent surviving Welsh lord, Rhys ap Maredudd, continued to augment the castle's defences. He was allowed by the English to keep his castle as he had shown a more conciliatory attitude towards them than other Welsh lords. However, in 1287 he revolted against English rule, and the castle was besieged and captured after a three-week siege by the forces of King Edward I. The English troops numbered 11,000 and methods of assault included the use of a trebuchet and the undermining of the curtain walls. Several English knights were killed when one of the mine workings collapsed while they were inspecting it. Rhys's revolt petered out the following year, and Rhys himself was captured and executed in 1292. Dryslwyn was seized by Owain Glynd≈µr in the summer of 1403 and when the English forces recaptured it, they decommissioned it by blocking various access routes, walling up the gatehouse, removing the treads from stone stairs and even removing the hinges from the main gate. At some later stage, all the major buildings were burned to the ground. Following this a lot of the stone was removed from the site. Structure Dryslwyn Castle The castle of limestone walls was built in the 1220s, and was systematically demolished in the early 15th Century, presumably in an attempt to stop Welsh rebels using it again. The polygonal inner ward contains principal remains to the south west, with traces of middle and outer wards to the north east. The early 13th Century curtain wall to the inner ward only stands 1m high. There is a garderobe to the east side, and a remodelled 13th Century gatehouse to the north east, surviving at foundation level only. On the south side of gatehouse is the round tower, the original keep. The foundations of the original great hall and Rhys ap Maredudd's hall survive.  Dryslwyn today  Little is left of the original structure and much of what is now visible has been revealed by excavation. A small portion of the middle and outer walls survive, mostly associated with the middle and outer gates. The best-preserved remains are within the inner ward, and here can be seen the polygonal plan that was adopted to fit in with the shape of the hilltop. It is considered one of the most important remaining structures built by a Welsh chieftain and is a Grade I listed building noteworthy as the only native Welsh castle to have three wards.

A wide variety of drugs are injected, often opioids: these may include legally prescribed medicines and medication such as morphine, as well as stronger compounds often favored in recreational drug use, which are often illegal. Although there are various methods of taking drugs, injection is favoured by some people as the full effects of the drug are experienced very quickly, typically in five to ten seconds. It also bypasses first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in higher bioavailability and efficiency for many drugs (such as morphine or diacetylmorphine/heroin; roughly two-thirds of which is destroyed in the liver when consumed orally) than oral ingestion would. The effect is that the person gets a stronger (yet shorter-acting) effect from the same amount of the drug. Drug injection is therefore often related to substance dependence. In recreational-use drug culture, preparation may include mixing the powdered drug with water to create an aqueous solution, and then the solution is injected. This act is often colloquially referred to as \\"slamming\\", \\"shooting up\\", ‚Äúsmashing‚Äù, \\"banging\\", \\"pinning\\", or \\"jacking-up\\", often depending on the specific drug subculture in which the term is used (i.e. heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine). Disadvantages In addition to general problems associated with any IV drug administration (see risks of IV therapy), there are some specific problems associated with the injection of drugs by non-professionals, such as: * Chance of infection ‚Äì This is generally a twofold major concern: ** Needle sharing or sharing syringes may transmit blood-borne diseases between users, such as HIV-AIDS and Hepatitis C ** Abscessed infections of injection sites are caused by lack of proper hygiene and a lack of aseptic technique during the injection process. * Increased chance of overdose ‚Äì Because IV injection delivers a dose of drug straight into the bloodstream, it is harder to gauge how much to use (as opposed to smoking or snorting, where the dose can be increased relatively incrementally until the desired effect is achieved; this gives a user who is in danger of overdosing a chance to seek medical treatment before respiratory arrest sets in). In addition, because of the rapid onset of intravenous drugs, overdose can occur very quickly, requiring immediate action. Another reason that overdose is a risk is because the purity of street drugs varies a great deal. * Scarring of the peripheral veins ‚Äì This arises from the use of blunt injecting equipment. This is particularly common with users who have been injecting while in jail and re- use disposable syringes sometimes hundreds of times. IV drug use for an extended period may result in collapsed veins. Though rotating sites and allowing time to heal before reuse may decrease the likelihood of this occurring, collapse of peripheral veins may still occur with prolonged IV drug use. IV drug users are among the most difficult patient populations to obtain blood-specimens from because of peripheral venous scarring. The darkening of the veins due to scarring and toxin buildup produce tracks along the length of the veins and are known as track marks. * Arterial damage ‚Äì Arterial pseudoaneurysms may form at injection sites, which can rupture, potentially resulting in hemorrhage, distal ischemia, and gangrene. Inadvertent intra- arterial injection can also result in endarteritis and thrombosis, with ultimately similar consequences. * Increased chance of addiction ‚Äì The heightened effect of administering drugs intravenously can make the chances of addiction more likely. * Social stigma ‚Äì In many societies, there is a social stigma attached to IV drug use, in addition to the more general stigma around illegal drug use and addiction. Procedure lean, promethazine, an antiemetic, and unidentified pills. The drug‚Äîusually (but not always) in a powder or crystal form‚Äîis dissolved in water, normally in a spoon, tin, bottle cap, the bottom of a soda can, or another metal container. Cylindrical metal containers‚Äîsometimes called \\"cookers\\"‚Äîare provided by needle exchange programs. Users draw the required amount of water into a syringe and squirt this over the drugs. The solution is then mixed and heated from below if necessary. Heating is used mainly with heroin (though not always, depending on the type of heroin), but is also often used with other drugs, especially crushed tablets. Cocaine HCl (powdered cocaine) dissolves quite easily without heat. Heroin prepared for the European market is insoluble in water and usually requires the addition of an acid such as citric acid or ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) powder to dissolve the drug. Due to the dangers from using lemon juice or vinegar to acidify the solution, packets of citric acid and Vitamin C powder are available at needle exchanges in Europe. In the U.S., vinegar and lemon juice are used to shoot crack cocaine. The acids convert the water- insoluble cocaine base in crack to a cocaine salt (cocaine acetate or cocaine citrate), which is water-soluble (like cocaine hydrochloride). Once the drugs are dissolved, a small syringe (usually 0.5 or 1 cc) is used to draw the solution through a filter, usually cotton from a cigarette filter or cotton swab (cotton bud). \\"Tuberculin\\" syringes and types of syringes used to inject insulin are commonly used. Commonly used syringes usually have a built-in 28 gauge (or thereabouts) needle typically 1/2 or 5/8 inches long. The preferred injection site is the crook of the elbow (i.e., the Median cubital vein), on the user's non-writing hand. Other users opt to use the Basilic vein; while it may be easier to \\"hit\\", caution must be exercised as two nerves run parallel to the vein, increasing the chance of nerve damage, as well as the chance of an arterial \\"nick\\". Recreational drugs Risks Risks from drug injection are caused by a variety of factors, including unclean or unsafe injection practices and repeated injections at the same site. Injection drug users that fail to adequately sanitize the skin or use clean injection products are at increased risk for cellulitis, abscesses, and thrombophlebitis; these infections can subsequently result in sepsis and bacteremia, which can be fatal if untreated. Repetitive injections, especially those with unsafe practices, can result in additional medical concerns that include thrombosis formation and infectious endocarditis. In rare cases Osteomyelitis of the chest can be caused by IV drug use. Additional risks from unsafe injection practices result primarily from sharing materials (needles, cookers, syringes) used in injection. Blood-borne pathogens, such as HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C are of particular concern among injection drug users who share supplies, and increase the likelihood of infection. An added challenge, is that not only infected individuals know their positive status and continue to share supplies, placing other users at risk for infection as well. 30-50% of adults will not experience acute Hepatitis B symptoms, and those that do experience lethargy, nausea, upper abdominal pain, muscle aches, or a darkening of urine will need to connect these symptoms to a possible infection to seek care and limit spreading of the virus. Of all the ways to ingest drugs, injection carries the most risks by far as it bypasses the body's natural filtering mechanisms against viruses, bacteria, and foreign objects. There will always be much less risk of overdose, disease, infections, and health problems with alternatives to injecting, such as smoking, insufflation (snorting or nasal ingestion), or swallowing. Drug injection is also commonly a component in HIV-related syndemics. Fragments from injection of pills are known to clog the small blood vessels of the lungs, brain, and elsewhere, potentially causing pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke, or venous embolism. A small proportion of PE is due to the embolization of air, fat, and talc in the drugs of intravenous drug abusers. More commonly, the inflammatory response to these foreign objects causes granulation tissue to form in the capillary beds, resulting in vasculitis, and, when it occurs in the pulmonary capillary bed, potentially pulmonary talcosis. Hitting arteries and nerves is dangerous, painful, and presents its own similar spectrum of problems. The injection of talc from crushed pills has been associated with pulmonary talcosis in intravenous drug users. Harm reduction A sterile and safe injection kit obtained from a needle exchange program Harm reduction is a public health approach that serves as an alternative to abstinence-only guidance. While it does not condone the use of illicit or illegal drugs, it does seek to reduce the harms, risks and dangers associated with illicit drug use, both for the person using illicit drugs and the wider community. Injection drug users that re-use drug delivery components put themselves and others at risk for diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, as well as increase their chances of getting a serious infection. In 2015, the CDC performed an HIV Surveillance Report and attributed 2,392 (6%) of new HIV diagnoses to IV drug use in the US. A prominent method for addressing the issue of disease transmission among intravenous drug users are needle exchange programs (also known as syringe exchange programs, syringe service programs or needle-syringe programs), where people who inject drugs (PWID) can access sterile needles, syringes, and other paraphernalia. In addition to providing sterile devices used in drug injection, these programs often offer access to infectious disease testing, referrals for drug abuse or mental health treatment programs, and more. The idea behind harm reduction approaches is to slow disease transmission, such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C, and promote public health by reducing the practice of sharing used needles. In countries where harm reduction programs are limited or non-existent, it is quite common for an IV users to use a single needle repeatedly or share with other users. It is also quite uncommon for a sterilizing agent to be used on needles and syringes. This creates a high risk population for the spread of bloodborne pathogens. A new approach to reduce harm to IV drug users was recently started in Southern Nevada in 2017. Trac-B Exchange - Southern Nevada Harm Reduction Program was approved in early 2017 to help reduce the spread of HIV in \\"People Who Inject Drugs\\". In Nevada, the sharing of needles for drug injections has led to an increase in the spread of HIV and hepatitis B and C. In an effort to reduce the spread of blood borne pathogens, Southern Nevada installed vending machines to give access to sterile needles to those using them for drug injections. Individuals who use these vending machines are required to register with Trac-B and are allowed 2 boxes a week. The boxes contain sterile needles as well as other supplies necessary to reduce the risk of spreading blood borne pathogens. If this pilot program is successful in reducing the spread of bloodborne pathogens, we may see programs like this spread to other parts of the country. Although this is a new idea in the United States, it was tested in Europe over 20 years ago. In order to combat the AIDS epidemic that was spreading across Europe, France allowed pharmacies to dispense needles without a prescription and implemented needle exchange programs. In 1996, they began a pilot program of syringe vending machines, similar to a coin-operated vending machine. The first vending machines were placed in Marseille due to its high occurrence of AIDS caused by sharing of needles. The results of their study was published in 1999. They found that when the availability of syringes increased, more and more people began to purchase sterile needles. It also provided a discrete way for people to purchase needles without having to feel embarrassed going into a pharmacy. They theorized that with greater access to sterile needles, they would expect to see a reduction in bloodborne pathogen cases. Beyond just needle exchange programs, the other major harm reduction strategy for drug users are safe injecting facilities (SIFs). These provide a sterile environment for people who inject drugs to do so cleanly, and with sterile syringes which are forced to be thrown away after use so that no re- use occurs. The first of these facilities opened in Switzerland, but there are now over 100 globally including one in Vancouver - Canada, Sydney - Australia, and most recently, Melbourne - Australia. Modifications Particularly for intravenous administration, self-injection in the arm can be awkward, and some people modify a syringe for single-handed operation by removing the plunger and affixing a bulb such as from a large dropper or baby pacifier to the end of the barrel to in effect make it a large dropper with a needle affixed. This is therefore a variant of the common method of injection with a dropper with the hypodermic needle affixed, using a \\"collar\\" made of paper or other material to create a seal between the needle and dropper. Removing part of the plunger assembly by cutting off most of the shaft and thumb rest and affixing the bulb to the end of the barrel, thereby allowing the bulb to operate the plunger by suction, also does work in many cases. An alternative to syringes in the 1970s was to use a glass medicine dropper, supposedly easier to manipulate with one hand. A large hairpin was used to make a hole in the skin and the dropper containing the drug (usually heroin) was inserted and the bulb squeezed, releasing it into the tissues. This method was also reported‚Äîby William S Burroughs and other sources‚Äîfor intravenous administration at least as far back as 1930. Alternatives Swallowing tends to be the safest and slowest method of ingesting drugs. It is safer as the body has a much greater chance to filter out impurities. As the drug comes on slower, the effect tends to last longer as well, making it a favorite technique on the dance scene for speed and ecstasy. People rarely take heroin orally, as it is converted to morphine in the stomach and its potency is reduced by more than 65% in the process. However, oral bioavailability of opioids is heavily dependent on the substance, dose, and patient in ways that are not yet understood. History IV drug use is a relatively recent phenomenon arising from the invention of re-usable syringes and the synthesis of chemically pure morphine and cocaine. It was noted that administering drugs intravenously strengthened their effect, and‚Äîsince such drugs as heroin and cocaine were already being used to treat a wide variety of ailments‚Äîmany patients were given injections of \\"hard\\" drugs for such ailments as alcoholism and depression. Origin and early use The hypodermic needle and syringe in its current form was invented by the French scientist Charles Pravaz in 1851, and became especially known during the wars of that and the subsequent decade. However, the first well-known attempt to inject drugs into the body was a 1667 attempt to inject a solution of opium into a dog, and some had suspected that parenteral administration of drugs may work better based on the practise of rubbing opium and other drugs into sores or cuts on the skin for the purpose of causing systemic absorption and the beginnings of scientific understanding of the functioning of the lungs. During most of the 1850s, the previously-held belief that opiate dependence and addiction (often called \\"the opium appetite\\", or, when relevant, the \\"morphine appetite\\" or \\"codeine appetite\\") was due to the drug's action on the digestive system‚Äîjust like any hunger or thirst‚Äîcaused doctors to opt to inject morphine rather than administer it orally, in the hope that addiction would not develop. Certainly, by c. 1870 or earlier, it was manifest that this was not the case and the title of earliest morphine addict as the term is currently understood is often given to Pravaz' wife, although habituation through orally ingesting the drug was known before this time, including Friedrich Sert√ºrner and his associates, followers, wife, and dog. To some extent, it was also believed early on that bypassing the lungs would prevent opium addiction, as well as habituation to tobacco. Ethanol in its usual form generally is not injected and can be very damaging by most routes of injection; in modern times, it is used as an alternative or potentiator of phenol (carbolic acid) in procedures to ablate damaged nerves. In or shortly after 1851, the drugs which had been discovered and extracted from their plants of origin and refined into pure crystalline salts soluble in water included morphine (1804 or late 1803), codeine (1832), narcotine/noscapine (1803-1805?), papaverine (1814), cocaine (1855), caffeine (1819), quinine (1820), atropine (1831), scopolamine (aka hyoscine, aka laevo-duboisine) (1833?), hyoscyamine or laevo- atropine (1831), opium salts mixtures (c. 1840s), chloral derivatives (1831 et seq.), ephedrine (1836?), nicotine (1828), and many others of all types, psychoactive and not. Morphine in particular was used much more widely after the invention of the hypodermic syringe, and the practise of local anaesthesia by infiltration was another step forward in medicine resulting from the hypodermic needle, discovered at around the same time that it was determined that cocaine produced useful numbing of the mucous membranes and eye. A wide variety of drugs are injected. Among the most popular in many countries are morphine, heroin, cocaine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. Prescription drugs‚Äîincluding tablets, capsules, and even liquids and suppositories‚Äîare also occasionally injected. This applies particularly to prescription opioids, since some opioid addicts already inject heroin. Injecting preparations which were not intended for this purpose is particularly dangerous because of the presence of excipients (fillers), which can cause blood clots. Injecting codeine into the bloodstream directly is dangerous because it causes a rapid histamine release, which can lead to potentially fatal anaphylaxis and pulmonary edema. Dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, nicocodeine, and other codeine- based products carry similar risks. Codeine may instead be injected by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. The effect will not be instant, but the dangerous and unpleasant massive histamine release from the intravenous injection of codeine is avoided. To minimize the amount of undissolved material in fluids prepared for injection, a filter of cotton or synthetic fiber is typically used, such as a cotton-swab tip or a small piece of cigarette filter. Some manufacturers add the narcotic antagonist naloxone or the anticholinergics atropine and homatropine (in lower than therapeutic doses) to their pills to prevent injection. Unlike naloxone, atropine does indeed help morphine and other narcotics combat neuralgia. The atropine may very well not present a problem, and there is the possibility of atropine content reduction of soluble tablets by placing them on an ink blotter with a drop of water on top, then preparing a shot from the remainder of the pill. Canada and many other countries prohibit manufacturers from including secondary active ingredients for the above reason; their Talwin PX does not contain naloxone. However, as a narcotic agonist‚Äìantagonist, pentazocine and its relatives can cause withdrawal in those physically dependent upon narcotics.

It is commonly known as the blackcurrant gall mite or big bud mite. It feeds on the plants' buds, forms galls, and transmits a virus which causes blackcurrant reversion disease. The mite is a serious pest of blackcurrant crops in Europe, but rarely on other continents. Biology Buds affected by Cecidophyopsis ribis become swollen and globular and fail to develop normally. They are first noticeable in the autumn when they are unpointed and twice as large as normal buds. Inside the bud, between the closely folded leaves, are thousands of small, spherical eggs which later hatch into sausage-shaped mites with short legs near their anterior end. The mites suck sap from the buds and while they are doing so, can transmit the virus that causes blackcurrant reversion disease. The mites are long. When mature they move out of the buds onto the twigs where they make their way to uninfested buds or may feed on the foliage later in the season causing distortion of the leaves. Crop yields are reduced as a result of the damage they do. The mites are so tiny that they can easily be blown or splashed onto other bushes or carried inadvertently by flying insects. They breed during the summer and autumn, laying their eggs inside new buds. They can also infest the buds of gooseberries, whitecurrants or redcurrants, but in these the affected buds die and \\"big bud\\" symptoms do not develop. These alternative host fruit bushes are not susceptible to blackcurrant reversion disease. Blackcurrant reversion disease The virus causing blackcurrant reversion is transmitted by Cecidophyopsis ribis. The characteristic leaf symptoms are a smaller number of leaf lobes and a decrease in the number of teeth on the serrated edge of the leaves. The flowers also show symptoms, with the buds being less hairy than normal and, in a severe form of the disease present in Russia and Scandinavia, the sepals appearing to be doubled in number to ten. The vigor of the bush is reduced, and fruit yields diminish. Although spread of the mite can be prevented to some extent, badly affected bushes should be destroyed and replaced with virus-free stock. Until 2019 the virus was found everywhere blackcurrents grew except North America and Australia. However in 2019 it was detected for the first time in Oregon, USA. Although these mites are the only known vector, the mites themselves have not been found. It is unknown whether something else is vectoring the pathogen or if this evidences another transmission route is working in this area. Distribution Cecidophyopsis ribis is found mainly in Europe and Asia, but has also reached New Zealand. It is not found in North America or Australia and quarantine restrictions apply to the import of susceptible plants.

He forced the Rodstein family to go to his room at the same motel, which was located directly next door to their own room. He bound the family of four with tape, gagged them, and took their money. Over the next two days, Dawson strangled three of the four family members: 39-year-old David Rodstein, his wife 39-year-old Monica, and their 11-year-old son Andrew. Their 15-year-old daughter Amy was found alive in Dawson's motel room two days after the murders.  Sentencing and execution  The trial for Dawson came to a close in February 1987. The jury deliberated about 14 hours and returned with guilty verdicts for three counts of deliberate homicide, four guilty verdicts for kidnapping each member of the Rodstein family, and a guilty verdict for robbery. Dawson waived the ability to appeal his conviction and sentence. Dawson's last meal consisted of two double cheeseburgers, two large servings of French fries, half a gallon of vanilla fudge ripple ice cream, and two bottles of Dr Pepper. When asked if he had any last words, Dawson said \\"No.\\" He was executed by lethal injection on 11 August 2006 under the authority of the state of Montana, the first execution in Montana in more than eight years.

ESPN had been slated to broadcast games for the 2004‚Äì05 NHL season, but the season's cancellation combined with the NHL reaching an agreement with OLN (now NBCSN) to broadcast games for the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season effectively ended National Hockey Night after the 2003‚Äì04 NHL season. Coverage overview 1979‚Äì1982 and 1985‚Äì1988 ESPN initially covered the NHL during the , and seasons by making deals with individual teams. This included eleven Hartford Whalers home broadcasts in 1980‚Äì81 and 25 the following year. During this time, USA also broadcast National Hockey League games. In order to prevent overexposure, the NHL decided to grant only one network exclusive rights. In April 1982, USA outbid ESPN for the NHL's American national television cable package ($8 million for two years). In 1984, the NHL asked ESPN for a bid, but then gave USA the right to match it, which it did. After the 1984‚Äì85 season, the NHL Board of Governors chose to have USA Network and ESPN submit sealed bids. ESPN won by bidding nearly $25 million for three years, about twice as much as USA had been paying. The contract called for ESPN to air up to 33 regular season games each season as well as the NHL All-Star Game and the Stanley Cup playoffs. The network chose Dan Kelly and Sam Rosen to be the network's first play-by-play announcers, Mickey Redmond and Brad Park were selected to be the analysts, and Tom Mees and Jim Kelly were chosen to serve as studio hosts. ESPN designated Sundays as Hockey Night in America, but also aired select midweek telecasts. ESPN aired its first game, an opening-night matchup between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers, on October 10, 1985. 1992-2004 From its debut in 1992 until the 2001‚Äì02 NHL season, weekly regular-season games were broadcast on Sundays (between NFL and baseball seasons), Wednesdays, and Fridays, and were titled Sunday/Wednesday/Friday Night Hockey. Prior to 1999, these telecasts were non-exclusive, meaning they were blacked out in the regions of the competing teams, and an alternate game was shown in these affected areas. Beginning in 1999‚Äì2000 season, ESPN was permitted two exclusive telecasts per team per season. When ESPN started broadcasting NBA games on Wednesday and Friday nights in 2002, the weekly hockey broadcasts were moved to Thursday and the broadcasts renamed to Thursday Night Hockey. Beginning in 1993-94, up to five games per week were also shown on ESPN2 (dubbed \\"Fire on Ice\\"). During the Stanley Cup playoffs, ESPN and ESPN2 provided almost nightly coverage, often carrying games on both channels concurrently. Games in the first two rounds were non-exclusive, while telecasts in the Conference Finals and Finals were exclusive (except in 1993 and 1994). OLN/Versus replaces ESPN Before the 2004‚Äì05 lockout, the NHL had reached two separate deals with NBC (who would replace ABC as the NHL's American national broadcast television partner) and ESPN. ESPN offered the NHL $60 million for about 40 games (only fifteen of which would be during the regular season), all on ESPN2, with presumably, only some midweek playoff games, the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final and the All-Star Game airing on ESPN. NBC's deal involved a revenue sharing agreement with the NHL as opposed to a traditional rights fee, and included rights to six regular season windows, seven postseason broadcasts and games 3‚Äì7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. ESPN had a two-year deal that they opted out of after the lockout, leaving the NHL without a cable partner. In August 2005, Comcast (who owns the Philadelphia Flyers) paid $70 million a year for three years to put games (54 or more games each season under the agreement, generally on Monday and Tuesday nights) on OLN, later known as Versus. Due to the abbreviated off-season, the 2005‚Äì06 schedule did not offer OLN exclusivity, which they received in 2006‚Äì07. Versus would also cover the playoffs and exclusively air Games 1 and 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals. NBC has continued to serve as the NHL's long-term U.S. broadcast partner. Following the purchase of NBC by Comcast and the merger of Versus into NBC Sports as NBC Sports Network, the broadcast and cable rights were unified in the 2011-12 season and renewed through 2020‚Äì21 season. Although it has not held rights since, ESPN was the U.S. broadcaster of the NHL-backed 2016 World Cup of Hockey as NBC declined due to programming conflicts, while ESPN's subscription platform ESPN+ (which launched 2018) added an NHL studio program, a free daily regular season game courtesy of NHL.tv (which is operated by Disney subsidiary BAMTech), and a Stanley Cup Playoffs documentary series (replacing one produced as part of Showtime's All Access franchise).

It occurs up to an altitude of 900 m. It is fairly common, except in arid areas. In Costa Rica and most of Panama it is restricted to the Caribbean lowlands, while essentially restricted to the humid parts of the Choc√≥ further south.

The female incubates the two brown-blotched white eggs for 15‚Äì16 days to hatching. The black-capped pygmy tyrant is a tiny short-tailed bird, 6.5 cm long, and weighing 5.2 g. The crown is black, shading to dark grey on the rest of the head, and contrasting with the white ‚Äúspectacles‚Äù. The rest of the upperparts are olive-green. The tail and the wings are blackish with yellow edging to the feathers and two yellow wing bars. The throat and central breast are white, shading to grey on the flanks and pale yellow on the belly. The sexes are similar, but females have a duller, sootier crown, and young birds have a browner crown and upperparts, and their wing markings and underparts are tinged with buff. The black-capped pygmy tyrant can be seen alone, in pairs, or family groups, hunting small insects in rapid dashes. The call is a thin ttseep which can be confused with an insect or frog.

The village lies on the banks of the Lawa River, which forms the border with French Guiana.  Name  The indigenous name of the village is Kawemhakan, which translates to \\"high riverbank\\" in the Wayana language. The village is also known by the name Anapaik√´, which is the name of the late granman of the Wayana in Suriname, who died end july 2002. The Baptist missionaries called the village Lawa Station, and many Wayana still refer to the village as \\"Lawa\\".  History  Kawemhakan was founded in 1958, primarily by people who lived in the village of the local chief Janomal√´, which was situated further upstream the Lawa River. It was common practice by Wayana to relocate to another village after the death of a chief, but Janomal√´'s death coincided with the arrival of Baptist missionaries to the area. Both the American missionaries and the Surinamese government wanted to concentrate the Wayana in a central location, as that would make their missionary and development efforts easier. At the instigation of the Baptist missionaries, Anapaik√´ was installed by the Surinamese government as the first granman of the Wayana. Kawemhakan soon flourished as the main Wayana village in Suriname. The Surinamese government built a modern prefabricated Bruynzeel house for Anapaik√´, with amenities such as a toilet, a shower and a kitchen, which were considered very modern by the Wayana in the 1960s. An airstrip was built to provide transport to Paramaribo and a clinic was established to provide basic healthcare.  Education  In the early 1970s, a primary school was built in Kawemhakan. This school closed its doors at the start of the Surinamese Interior War, and was only temporarily reopened in the early 1990s as part of an international emergency aid package. After the emergency aid expired, the teachers left Kawemhakan again, and children from Kawemhakan have been going to the French school in Talhuwen ever since. Schoolchildren of Kawemhakan and Kumakahpan are transported to Talhuwen every school day by boat.  Healthcare  Kawemhakan is home to a Medische Zending healthcare centre, which in 1968 took over the provision of basic healthcare services from the Baptist missionaries. The clinic was funded by Dutch NGO Simavi and Surinamese businesses.  Geography  Kawemhakan lies about downstream the Lawa River from the villages of Kulumuli, Taluwen, Epoja and Alawataim√´ en√Ø, and upstream the Lawa River from the village of √âlah√©, which both lie on the east bank of the river and hence are in French Guiana.  Transport   By air  Kawemhakan is served by Lawa Anapaike Airstrip, offering scheduled services to and from Paramaribo.  Communications  Since August 2016, a telecommunications and broadcasting tower is operational in Kawemhakan, offering ATSC broadcasts of STVS and ATV television networks, as well as GSM coverage on the Telesur network.

Up to 1995, the villages of Apoera, Washabo and Section were governed by the same chieftain due to their close vicinity.  Healthcare  Apoera is home to a Medische Zending healthcare centre. Economic development In the framework of the West-Suriname plan from 1976 to 1978 an 80 kilometer long railway was built from the south of Apoera to the Bakhuis mountain range, for bauxite mining. It was intended that Apoera would be developed into a port where bauxite ships could dock, but in the end the railroad was never used for this purpose. According to this West Suriname Plan, Apoera would be transformed into a prosperous harbor city transporting bauxite coming from the Bakhuis Mountains to the ships in the harbor. The plan never came to fruition and the 63 prefab houses for the workmen had been abandoned and often squatted. In 2003, twelve houses were sold to the inhabitants. In the framework of the IIRSA project on the upgrading of the road between Ciudad Guayana, San Mart√≠n de Turumbang, Linden, Apoera and Paramaribo, a bridge spanning the Courantyne River is planned near Apoera.IIRSA.org - Guyana Shield Hub presentation IIRSA.org - Venezuela (Ciudad Guayana)-Guiana (Georgetown)-Suriname (Paramaribo) Road (1st Stage) According to a study by Pitou van Dijk, the Linden-Paramaribo section has only secondary priority with IIRSA at the moment.Pitou van Dijk - The IIRSA Guyana Shield Hub: The Case of Suriname There was timber extraction taking place at Apoera including at the business complex of the sawmill of the Greenheart Group, but Greenheart closed the sawmill in 2015.

There is a little harbour near Batavia where the offices of the Nederlandse Handelsmaatschappij were located. Between 1873 and 1883, contract workers who were recruited from Java to work the plantations, were transported by the Nederlandse Handelsmaatschappij, and arrived in Batavia. Leper colony In 1790, an area of uncultivated land known near the Coppename River known as Voorzorg, was designated to treat leprosy. In due time plantations started to sprawl around the leprosy colony, and in 1824, the colony moved its current location in Batavia. Batavia was a military post along the Cordon Road. In 1856, Peter Donders, a Catholic priest, started work in Batavia, and tend to the sick. In 1865, the colony was assigned to the Redemptorists. In 1866, Donders joined the Redemptorists, because one of their rules is \\"They shall work among the most abandoned.\\" In 1883, Monsignor Schaap requested retirement for Donders, because Donders was old and spoke unintelligibly, however the lepers launched a protest against the decision. Donders remained among the lepers until his death on 14 January 1887. Donders was beatified by Pope John Paul II on 23 May 1982. Batavia was closed in 1897, and the lepers were moved to the former plantation Groot Chatillon. Batavia was burned to the ground to prevent a future outbreak of leprosy In 2000 plans were made to restore the colony.

It is named after the English consul and bullion dealer Benz.  Geography  The village lies in the jungle of the Tapanahony resort, near the Lawa River that forms the border with French Guiana, an overseas region and further north, in the Marowijne. Near Benzdorp is the rapids of Oemankrassiabra. Downstream (to the North) lies the town of Cottica and upstream is Anapaike. To the Southeast, across the Lawa River is the French Guyanese place Maripasoula.  Notable landmark  Southwest of the village is Fatu Switie, a mountain ridge with an altitude of about 375 meters.  History  Around 1885, gold was found in this area between the Lawa and the Tapanahony rivers, but because there was a disputed border between the Dutch and the French colony, the case was submitted to Russian Tsar Alexander III who in May 1891 awarded the area to Suriname. In 1902, then-Governor Cornelis Lely in Suriname, decided that the Lawa Railway would be built by the government. The railway line would transport gold from the Lawa area to Paramaribo. The proposed railway line was only half completed from Paramaribo due to disappointing gold finds. Around 1974, the population of the village shrunk to about 10 inhabitants. More recently, gold seekers have returned to the village, including a relatively large number of garimpeiros (Brazilian gold miners), and it became a gold extraction area since the early 1990s. The garimpeiros and gowtuman (Surinamese gold miners) moved inland, founding a new village referred to as Benzdorp, though it is kilometers away from the original village Benz founded on the banks of the Lawa River (which is now called \\"the landing\\"). An estimated 600 people live in the contemporary Benz village, of which two thirds come from Brazil and the others are maroons. Benzdorp is originally an Aluku (or Aloekoe or Boni) village; both banks (but especially the French) of the Lawa on this height have been inhabited by the Aluku Maroons for hundreds of years. These people have been active as gold miners in this part of their habitat. The Surinamese government has the rights to gold mining in the Benz village and surroundings and has issued a concession to Grassalco, which provides contracts to the (Brazilian, Surinamese and French) gold miners for a monthly fee.  Notable disasters  In May 2006, the village was flooded when the water of the Lawa reached far beyond the banks as a result of heavy rainfall, where also many other Surinamese villages suffered from then. On April 3, 2008, an airplane operated by Blue Wing Airlines crashed upon landing at Lawa Antino Airport near Benzdorp in which 19 people were killed. The Lawa Antino airport is west of Benzdorp. On May 17, 2013, a private helicopter from French Guiana, tasked with transporting gold during an unregistered flight in the interior of Suriname, crashed near Benzdorp gold mining settlement of Boewese, in the concession of NaNa Resources. The pilot got injured with a leg fracture and was transferred for treatment to Maripasoula in French Guiana.http://suriname2013.com/reality/helicopter-crashed-during-unregistred- flight/  References  Populated places in Sipaliwini District ","title":"Benzdorp"},{"id":"6448396","text":"The Okkervil () is a river in Leningrad Oblast and the eastern part of the city of Saint Petersburg, Russia.

Pocket-hole joinery, or pocket-screw joinery, involves drilling a hole at an angle ‚Äî usually 15 degrees ‚Äî into one work piece, and then joining it to a second work piece with a self-tapping screw.  Pocket hole jigs  Pocket holes can be formed by drilling a series of holes until a pocket hole is created, but pocket hole jigs make the process much quicker and easier. Pocket hole jigs allow the user to drill a hole at an accurate angle to get a good joint. Using a pocket hole jig also makes for a cleaner and neater appearance as opposed to creating a pocket hole without the help of a jig. A pocket hole jig is generally made of plastic and has a metal insert that the drill bit is inserted through to drill the hole. A jig can be a stationary device that the wooden pieces are clamped into, or a portable device that is clamped onto the wooden pieces.  Technique  When joining boards at a right angle, it is important that the cuts are precise and square to prevent gaps or un-perpendicular joints between the boards. Some woodworkers lay out their project before drilling their pocket holes and mark the face of the board that they want to drill to ensure the hole is in the correct location. Most pocket joints are made by screwing into the face or the edge of the board rather than the end grain because the screw will grab better.  Pocket hole joint screws  Self tapping pocket screws are used for pocket hole joints. Pocket screws are generally more expensive, but they are needed for a tight, strong joint. Pocket screws have a wide washer head to prevent screwing too far into the joint and cracking the wood. The self tapping screws will grip any type of wood, but coarse threads are needed for softer wood and fine threads are needed for harder wood.  Benefits  * Because the screws act as internal clamps holding the joint together, glue is unnecessary (but usually recommended) for most common joints. If glue is used, clamping is not required because of the ‚Äòinternal clamps‚Äô holding the joint together while the glue dries. *Gluing and screwing the joints together prevents gaps from forming as wood shrinks and expands with temperature and moisture. * Requires only one hole to be drilled, eliminating the need to precisely line up mating workpieces, as is required with dowel and mortise and tenon joints. * Does not require any complex mathematics or measurements, such as those used in mortise and tenon joints. * Because pocket-hole joinery doesn't require access to the inside of the joint, quick repairs are possible without completely disassembling the joint. Fixing a squeaky chair or strengthening furniture requires only the drilling of additional pocket holes, and the use of screws to pull the two pieces together. * Pocket hole joints have been proven to be superior to traditional joinery. A comparable mortise and tenon joint failed at 453 pounds under a shear load while a pocket hole joint failed at 707 pounds.  Drawbacks  * A broken pocket-hole joint \\"likely can‚Äôt be repaired\\".

Awala-Yalimapo is inhabited by Galibi Amerindians. History The first settlement of people from Jura failed in alcoholism and disease. In 1828, the Ministry of the Navy and Colonies sent Sister Anne-Marie Javouhey to colonize the area. Javouhey set out to build a viable community based on agriculture and invited black traders to settle, which was not the white colony as the Ministry envisioned. When 20 escaped slaves settled in the area, she bought them from their owners. In 1833, Governor Jean Jubelin visited Mana, and appreciated the efforts and progress. Jubelin arranged for orphans to be sent to Mana and the establishment of a leper colony in Acarouany. In 1838, the colony faced a manpower shortage. Javouhey suggested to educate and train 3,000 children of the slaves. The government refused to subsidize the plan, and Javouhey left in 1843.

In 1953, the residents decided to change the name to Maripasoula. Since the beginning of the 21st century, Maripasoula is at the heart of a gold rush. It has lead to a population increase from 4,507 people in 2006 to 13,227 in 2016. The majority of fortune seekers are illegal garimpeiro. Efforts by the French gendarme and military to stop the illegal gold mining, have resulted in illegal settlements across the Lawa River in Suriname where villages have sprung up. The most important being Antonio do Brinco which contains a string of supermarkets, restaurants, bars and brothels, and caters both to the gold prospectors and the town of Maripasoula, because of significantly lower prices. Because of problems with crime, the town is often referred to as \\"Far West\\", in a reference to the United States' historical Wild West.

When the first prisoners arrived in Camp de la R√©l√©gation on 20 June 1887, nothing was ready and they had to built the camp themselves. Most prisoners were housed in straw huts. The camps were abolished in 1946. Train at St Jean-du-Maroni (1900) Between 1890 and 1897, a 16 kilometre Decauville railway was constructed between Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and Saint-Jean-du-Maroni. The railway was abandoned after the penal camps closed. In 1987, Jacques Chirac as Prime Minister established Zones of Collective Use Rights (ZDUC). Saint-Jean-du-Maroni is the only Ndyuka village in France with a ZDUC status. ZDUC means that the village has communal land for hunting, fishing, agriculture and gathering. During 27 and 28 June 1988, a secret meeting was held in Saint-Jean-du-Maroni between the Suriname National Army, Jungle Commando, and France as mediator to discuss peace after the Surinamese Interior War which resulted in the 1989 Kourou ceasefire accords. Saint-Jean-du-Maroni is home to a military base of the Regiment of the Adapted Military Service (RSMA), and is the site where the General Staff is located.

It begins slightly north of Floras Lake, at the confluence of the lake outlet and Floras Creek, and runs north behind a foredune until entering the Pacific Ocean between Bandon and Port Orford. The river's name stems from its creation in 1890, when sand blocked the outlet from Floras Lake during a heavy storm, and the resulting flood created a new channel behind the foredune. The water from Floras Creek also flows down the new channel. The river loses only in elevation between source and mouth. Pre-history Evidence suggests that as early as 8,000 years ago, long before the New River existed, ancestors of the Siletz and Coquille peoples lived here in large villages near an estuary. On January 26, 1700, a tsunami destroyed the estuary and altered the landscape. After the catastrophe, blowing sand blocked streams, creating wetlands behind the dunes. Wildlife The area near the river, between Bandon to the north and Cape Blanco to the south, includes many state, federal, and county parks, recreation areas, and wildlife sanctuaries. Among those are the New River Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. The BLM encourages public uses of the site at the same time it works to protect habitat for native plants, birds, animals, and fish. European beachgrass, an invasive species, was planted here in the early 20th century to stabilize the dunes, which can grow to high. The dunes kept the river in its new channel but displaced native vegetation such as sand verbena and otherwise altered the habitats used by birds and other life forms. The New River is the southernmost area of record for rufous hummingbirds and the most northern for Allen's hummingbirds to have been observed breeding. Snowy plovers are present year-round. Posted areas within the ACEC are closed to the public from March 15 to September 15 to protect nesting plovers. The spring migration brings approximately 20,000 Aleutian cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii leucopareia) and close to 100,000 shorebirds. Recreation The New River ACEC comprises four units‚ÄîStorm Ranch, Floras Lake, Fourmile Creek, and Lost Lake‚Äîconnected by hiking trails to parking, restrooms, a Nature Center, and other structures. River Road, with a gravel surface suitable for bicycling and horseback-riding, as well as walking, leads from the parking area to a boat ramp on the New River. Canoers and kayakers can launch at Floras Lake and float down the lake outlet and down New River to a takeout at the ACEC's Storm Ranch, a trip of about , or an ACEC takeout at Lower Fourmile Road, a mile further downstream. The Lower Fourmile takeout involves at portage to a parking lot along Lower Fourmile Road. The Storm Ranch route may also require a portage since the River Road gate is closed to vehicles from March 15 to September 15. The New River supports populations of Chinook salmon and other migratory fish. The river is closed to fishing for coho salmon, but anglers can fish for Chinook, steelhead, and searun cutthroat trout from the river banks or from boats without motors. Surfperch frequent the river mouth.

It is also known as Castle Moil, Castle Maol, Dun Akyn, Dunakin Castle Dun Haakon and Castle Dunakin. Recreation of the 16th century exterior History The castle, an ancient seat of the Mackinnon clan, was a fortress commanding the strait of Kyle Akin between Skye and the mainland, through which all ships had to pass or else attempt the stormy passage of The Minch. The present building dates back to the 15th century, but is traditionally reputed to be of much earlier origin. According to that tradition, Alp√≠n mac Echdach's great-grandson Findanus, the 4th MacKinnon chief, brought Dunakin into the clan around the year 900 by marrying a Norse princess nicknamed 'Saucy Mary'. Findanus and his bride ran a heavy chain across the sound and levied a toll on all shipping vessels.The Genealogy of the Clan MacKinnon from Clan documents The Princess lies buried on Beinn na Caillich on Skye, her face reputedly turned towards Norway. Whatever the veracity of the castle's traditional history, there is good reason for supposing the existence of a connection of some kind with Norway. King Haakon IV is thought to have assembled his fleet of longships there before the Battle of Largs in 1263 (hence the name Kyleakin ‚Äì Haakon's kyle). Haakon's defeat at Largs effectively ended Norse domination of the Scottish islands. Medieval and early modern documents also refer to the castle itself as Dunakin (Dun- Haakon), which is again strongly suggestive of a Norse connection. Interior view of the large window on the first level ‚Äì the thickness of the walls is apparent The present structure is of late 15th or early 16th century construction. This is supported by historical documents and carbon dating. In 1513, a meeting of chiefs was held here and they agreed to support Donald MacDonald as Lord of the Isles. The last occupant of the castle was Neill MacKinnon, nephew of the 26th chief of the clan (c. 1601).On site informational sign from the Skye & Lochalsh District Council's Museums Service Description The castle occupies a headland above the village of Kyleakin facing the village of Kyle of Lochalsh across the strait. It is a simple rectangular keep of three stories. The unexplored basement level is filled with rubble and other debris and is believed to have contained the kitchen. The visitor today enters on the main level where the public dining space would have been. Stairs would have led up to the private apartments above. The castle is almost completely ruined. In 1949 and 1989 parts of the ruins broke away in storms. The remaining ruins have been secured to prevent further deterioration. No excavation of the ruins has been carried out, nor are planned. On 14 February 2018, a lightning strike destroyed part of the ruins; they have subsequently been stabilised.

It is a teaching- cum-affiliating university. The present campus at Vani Vihar located on a sprawling 399.9 acre area in the heart of Bhubaneswar. This is the largest affiliating university in the country with 267 affiliated general colleges, 15 law colleges, 6 medical and pharmacy colleges. At present the University has twenty-seven Post-Graduate teaching and research departments located within the campus, viz. Directorate of Distance and Continuing Education, University Law College at Vani Vihar and M.S. Law College at Cuttack. The University is located in the middle of the city. It is 5 km from the airport, 3 km from the railway station. Sainik school is to its north. Mancheswar industrial area is to its east. In 2016, Utkal University adopted its theme song from \\"tunga sikhar chula\\" (1st 3 stanzas) poem of Godabarish Mishra, one of its founder members. History A 2018 stamp dedicated to the 75th anniversary of Utkal University Utkal University Main Gate Main Park Goddess Saraswati After the separation of Odisha from Bihar and the creation of the new province of Odisha in April 1936, there was a strong desire among the leaders of the province for the establishment of a separate university in Odisha. Until 1936, all the colleges were under the jurisdiction of either Patna University or Andhra University. Subsequently, the government of Odisha, with Shri Biswanath Dash as the premier, appointed a committee on 2 March 1938, with Pandit Nilakantha Das as its chairman to examine the possibility of establishing a separate university in Odisha. During the premiership of Maharaja Krushna Chandra Gajapati, who played a pioneering role in the establishment of the university, the recommendation of this committee was made available. Pandit Godavarish Mishra, the then minister of education in the government of Odisha introduced the Utkal University Bill which was passed by the Odisha Legislative Assembly on 30 June 1943. On receiving the Governor's assent subsequently on 2 August 1943, the Utkal University Act 1943 came into force, clearing the way for the foundation of the university on 27 November 1943. In 1966, that Act was repealed and a new Utkal University Act was passed which came into effect from 1 January 1967. Initially, Utkal University was operating from Ravenshaw College, before it came to its own campus at Bhubaneswar, called Vani Vihar. Ravenshaw College remained affiliated to Patna University even after the separation of Odisha from Bihar in 1936; the affiliation was finally transferred to the newly created Utkal University in 1943. In fact, it was Ravenshaw College that gave birth to the new university, nursed and sustained it. It operated from Ravenshaw College's present Zoology Department building premises. The University has many departments from Anthropology to Zoology for post-graduate teaching. The foundation stone of the present campus was laid by Dr. Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India on 1 January 1958, and the campus was inaugurated by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second President of India on 2 January 1963. Location The campus is at the heart of Bhubaneswar city and right on NH-16 (old number NH 5). It is nearly 5 km from both the main railway station at Master Canteen and bus stand at Baramunda. All the Postgraduate departments and the law college are inside the campus. Evolution of the Undergraduate & Postgraduate Departments The initial Utkal University Act 1943 did not specify clearly the territorial jurisdiction of the university. However, its jurisdiction was extended to include the princely states in Odisha by an agreement between the rulers of these princely states and the Government of Odisha. According to the agreement, adequate representation of the princely states in the administrative and academic bodies of the university (15 members in the Senate, one member each in the Syndicate and the Academic Council) was granted. The Utkal University Act 1943 was accordingly amended in 1947 defining the territorial jurisdiction of the University which was subsequently extended further to the whole State of Odisha in 1950. Prana Krushna Parija, principal of Ravenshaw College, Cuttack was the first vice-chancellor of the university. V. V. John, the assistant professor of English in Ravenshaw College was the first registrar. The university, to start with, functioned mainly as an affiliating body. In 1949, it took over the management of the undergraduate department of law from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack, and established its first constituent college now known as Madhusudan Law College, Cuttack. In 1956, the second phase of its expansion began with the opening of the post-graduate Department of Geology in Ravenshaw College campus and the University College of Engineering, Burla, Sambalpur. A research department of Rural Economics and Sociology was started the same year with a generous grant from the Ford Foundation. In 1957, two new post-graduate departments in Philosophy and Sanskrit were established on the premises of the Burdwan House at Cuttack. That year the university office was shifted to the Circuit House at Cuttack. The University, in the initial phases, provided new facilities for post-graduate studies only in those subjects which did not exist in Ravenshaw College at that time. In 1958, the post-graduate departments of Psychology, Statistics, Political Science, and Anthropology were established. While the first three departments were housed on the premises of Ravenshaw College, the Department of Anthropology was accommodated in a rented house at Bhubaneswar. The University took over the Post-graduate Department of History from Ravenshaw College in 1959. Post- Graduate studies in Zoology and Commerce were introduced in 1960 and 1962 respectively. The Research Department of Rural Economics and Sociology was established in 1956, and Post-Graduate courses in Applied Economics were started in 1963. It was subsequently renamed as the Department of Analytical and Applied Economics. Around that time, a movement for the creation of regional universities started in different parts of Odisha. Accordingly, the Government of Odisha appointed the State University Committee in 1962 with Dr. P. Parija, the then Vice-Chancellor of Utkal University as the Chairman. P.G. Department of Commerce, Utkal University On the recommendation of the Committee, two more universities were created; one at Sambalpur and the other at Berhampur. The Utkal University Act 1943 was, in consequence, suitably amended to meet the new situation. The two new universities at Sambalpur and Berhampur came into existence with effect from 1 January 1967; the date from which the new Utkal University Act came into force. The jurisdiction of Utkal University, which earlier covered the whole state of Odisha, was redefined in the new legislation. After the establishment of the two new Universities, the management of the evening colleges at Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Sambalpur and Berhampur were taken over by the State Government. The Engineering College at Burla was handed over to Sambalpur University. Utkal University, in its new campus at Vani Vihar, opened few other Post-Graduate departments such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Oriya and English during the years 1966‚Äì69. The Department of Sociology and Labour Welfare was started in 1970, which in 1974 was split into the Department of Sociology, and the Department of Labour Welfare (now renamed as the Department of Personnel Management and Industrial Relations). The Department of Geography was opened in 1970. The Post-Graduate Department of Law (L.L.M.) was started in 1973. The Department of Geology, which was accommodated earlier in Ravenshaw College was shifted to Vani Vihar in 1977. Then the department of Library and Information Science and that of and Political Science Departments respectively, besides the 27 regular Post Graduate Programmes, along with Business Administration were opened in 1981 and in 1984 respectively. A Computer centre was established initially with different departments of the University. IBM-1130 computers were donated by the University Grants Commission in the year 1970 which has subsequently been placed by the WIPRO LANDMARK system at a cost of Rs. 16 lakh provided later by the University Grants Commission. The computer centre, while facilitating research work undertaken by various departments of the university earlier offered a Post-Graduate Diploma Course on Computer Application (DCA) from 1980 to 1997. In 1990, the university opened the Department of Computer Science and Applications. In 1999, the university came up with integrated MCA course, which is a 5-year post-graduation course after the 12th (10+2) standard. This course was very popular as students got placement with multi- national companies after completing it.

It would have been led by former Prime Minister Mike Moore and was intended to capture the balance of power on election night. Ultimately it was not registered and Moore stayed with Labour for the 1996 election. Background Following a push for Electoral reform in New Zealand, a referendum was held alongside the 1993 general election that gave voters a choice between the current electoral system, First Past the Post, and the Mixed Member Proportional system. This created opportunities for many smaller parties to be formed and win representation in parliament. Mike Moore had been replaced as Labour party leader following the party's defeat in the 1993 election. After losing the leadership Moore was overwhelmed with boxes full of letters of support, many suggesting him launch a new party. Michael Laws had become a rebel backbencher in the National Party caucus since his former boss, Winston Peters, had left the party in 1992. To prepare for the upcoming MMP system Moore had sent his campaign organiser Jeff McIntyre to Germany and study how minor parties campaigned under MMP. He spent most of his time with the centrist Free Democratic Party (FDP). History Early in 1994 Michael Laws and Mike Moore appear on TVNZ's current affairs programme Fraser together. Here they discuss the opportunities for a new centre party on air. The two reportedly decide afterwards that they should meet again to further discuss this opportunity. A meeting between Moore and Michelle Boag was organised in \\"late 1994\\" by Laws to discuss the potential of National Party donors financing a new Centre party. In 1995 meetings in Wellington between five interested MPs began. These were reportedly centered around the Yangtze restaurant in Wellington. Mike Moore was still uncommitted to the project however. Involved in the discussions were; * Mike Moore - Former Prime Minister who had been replaced as Labour leader after the 1993 election. * Michael Laws - National backbench MP. * Geoff Braybrooke - Labour MP & Friend of Moore. * Jack Elder - Labour MP & one of Moore's caucus allies. * Peter McCardle - National MP. * Clayton Cosgrove - Mike Moore's former Private Secretary in Christchurch. * Ron Mark - Former Labour Party Candidate for the Selwyn electorate. * Tony Day - Moore's local campaign organiser and former Fendalton candidate for Labour. Also rumored to be potential invitees to the new party were Damien O'Connor and Elizabeth Tennet. A \\"breakfast club\\" was later formed in which Laws, McCardle, Moore and Elder regularly meet to further discussions. Braybrooke was left out of these as he was suffering ill-health but he reportedly remained determined to follow Moore to any new party. Many names were considered for the proposed party including the \\"Peoples Party\\" before Democratic Coalition is selected. Laws favoured Peoples Party, but it was thought to sound too communist. The party colours were to be yellow and black, inspired by the FDP in Germany. In August 1995 a \\"conference\\" was held in Christchurch that involves all the MPs as well as Cosgrove and Mark. Here they elected Rosy Fenwick, a Hastings GP and friend of Laws, to be secretary-general and form a document known as \\"The Aims & Objectives of the New Zealand Democratic Coalition\\". Moore declared that he was 95% Committed. By the end of 1995 over 600 financial members were signed up and the party was ready to be registered (500 members are required to be registered under New Zealand electoral law). However Mike Moore was still undecided on forming the party. During the last week of the 1995 parliamentary session Moore met with Laws, McCardle and Elder to declare himself 99% committed. The first week of the 1996 parliamentary session was discussed as an ideal launch date. However, in an interview with The Sunday Star-Times the following weekend, Mike Moore stated that he was committed to Labour. In January 1996 a meeting was held in Moore's office. With Moore still uncommitted, Michael Laws told the others he will instead join the New Zealand First party. This led to Mike Moore pulling the plug on the project despite the other MPs still being keen. Aims and objectives To Select candidates of ability and integrity for election to the New Zealand House of Representatives who accept and endorse the following principles, aims and objectives: # To protect and promote the family unit; # To respect and uphold the rights and liberty of the individual; # To promote equality of opportunity regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic, cultural or religious background; # To provide economic and social policies that allow individuals to maximise their potential for both private and the common good; # To ensure the equality of all persons before the law...; # To protect New Zealand's territorial integrity and ensure this nation's independence in all international forums; # To promote co-operation and tolerance within the wider community; # To provide and promote an open and competitive economy that recognises and rewards enterprise and endeavour. # To provide policies that protect the weak and the vulnerable within our community and seek to empower those individuals to reach their potential. # To provide for and actively encourage the maximum possible participation in all aspects of local and central government decision-making; # To create an educated, enlightened, enterprising and responsible society and pursue policies to that end. # To provide an efficient, effective and accountable public sector that services the education, health and welfare needs of the wider community and is politically neutral and free of ideological bias; # To provide all members of the New Zealand Democratic Coalition with the opportunity to contribute to the organisation, policy and strategy of the Coalition.''  Aftermath  Michael Laws switched to the New Zealand First party in April 1996. However he was forced to resign as an MP shortly afterwards due to the \\"Antoinette Beck\\" scandal. He continued to work behind the scenes for New Zealand First helping them prepare for the 1996 election before retiring from politics. In 2004 he was elected the Mayor of Wanganui. Ron Mark, Peter McCardle and Jack Elder followed Laws to the New Zealand First party and became list MPs after the 1996 election. New Zealand First ended up holding the balance of power and formed a coalition with the National Party. Peter McCardle became the Minister of Employment and Jack Elder was appointed the Minister of Police. Ron Mark became the government's senior whip. In the later break up of the New Zealand First party McCardle and Elder stayed with the Government but did not seek reelection in 1999. Ron Mark instead remained with New Zealand First and stayed in parliament until the parties defeat in 2008. He was re-elected to parliament for New Zealand First in the 2014 election. Mike Moore, Clayton Cosgrove and Geoff Braybrooke instead remained with Labour. Moore was reelected as a Labour MP in 1996 but resigned in early 1999 so he could serve as the Director-General of the World Trade Organization. Moore's term ended on August 31, 2002. Cosgrove stood for Labour and was elected as the MP for Waimakariri in the 1999 election, replacing Moore. He was defeated in his electorate at the 2011 election, but remained in Parliament as a list MP until the 2017 election. Braybrooke retained the Napier seat until he retired at the 2002 election. Moore reflected in a 2017 interview on the discussions of the new party. When asked what stopped him following through he said \\"I'm Labour, I couldn't do it\\".

With Toussaint Louverture and Abram Petrovich Gannibal in Imperial Russia, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas stands as one of the highest-ranking men of African descent (his father being white, and his mother black) ever to lead a European army.Toussaint Louverture was commissioned as \\"general-in-chief\\" of the army in French Saint-Domingue during the Haitian Revolution. Alfred-Am√©d√©e Dodds, who was of one-eighth African descent, became a general of division in 1898 and general-in-chief in 1900, but commanded only colonial troops.

Floury, 1901), n.p.\\"Le G√©n√©ral Dodds\\". Abram Petrovich Gannibal had achieved major general rank in the Imperial Russian Army by 1752. In continental Europe, however, Alexandre Dumas is the only general of division and general-in-chief in modern history. He was the first person of color in the French military to become brigadier general, the first to become divisional general, and the first to become general-in-chief of a French army.Alexandre Dumas was made brigadier general (the entry-level rank for generals in the French military hierarchy) of the French Army of the West on 30 July 1793, general of division one month later, and general-in-chief of the Army of the Western Pyrenees. Tom Reiss, The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012), 145 and 147. The next black people to make brigadier general in the French military were Toussaint Louverture, Andr√© Rigaud, and Louis-Jacques Beauvais, all promoted to that rank on 23 July 1795. Madison Smartt Bell, Toussaint L'Ouverture: A Biography (New York: Vintage Books, 2007), 119. Note: Alexandre Dumas was the first French general of African descent, and was of mixed race; Louverture was the first French general of purely African descent. The assertion that Louverture was \\"the first black general in French history\\" is true if mixed-race men are not considered in this category, or if Dumas is overlooked. The claim has been made by Pierre Pluchon, Toussaint Louverture: Un r√©volutionnaire d'Ancien R√©gime (Paris: Fayard, 1989), 554, quoted in Daniel Desormeaux, Deborah Jenson and Molly Krueger Enz, \\"The First of the (Black) Memorialists: Toussaint Louverture\\", Yale French Studies no: 107 (2005), 138. Dumas and Toussaint Louverture (appointed a general-in-chief in 1797Madison Smartt Bell, Toussaint Louverture: A Biography (New York: Vintage Books, 2007), 144.) were the two highest-ranking officers of sub-Saharan African descent in the Western world until 1975, when \\"Chappie\\" James achieved the equivalent rank of four-star general in the United States Air Force. Born in Saint-Domingue, Thomas- Alexandre was the son of the Marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a white French nobleman and Marie-Cessette Dumas, an enslaved woman of African descent. He was born into slavery because of his mother's status, but his father took the boy with him to France in 1776 and had him educated. Slavery had been illegal in metropolitan France since 1315 and thus any slave would be freed de facto by being in the country. Christopher L. Miller, The French Atlantic triangle: literature and culture of the slave trade. Duke University Press. p.20 His father helped Thomas-Alexandre enter the French military. Dumas played a pivotal role in the French Revolutionary Wars. Entering the military as a private at age 24, Dumas rose by age 31 to command 53,000 troops as the General-in-Chief of the French Army of the Alps. Dumas's strategic victory in opening the high Alps passes enabled the French to initiate their Second Italian Campaign against the Austrian Empire. During the battles in Italy, Austrian troops nicknamed Dumas the Schwarzer Teufel (\\"Black Devil\\", Diable Noir in French).Report by Dumas's aide-de-camp Dermoncourt, quoted in Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 110.

Dumas served as commander of the French cavalry forces on the Exp√©dition d‚Äô√âgypte, a failed French attempt to conquer Egypt and the Levant. On the march from Alexandria to Cairo, he clashed verbally with the Expedition's supreme commander Napoleon Bonaparte, under whom he had served in the Italian campaigns. In March 1799, Dumas left Egypt on an unsound vessel, which was forced to put aground in the southern Italian Kingdom of Naples, where he was taken prisoner and thrown into a dungeon. He languished there until the spring of 1801. Returning to France after his release, he and his wife had a son, Alexandre Dumas, who became one of France's most widely read authors of all time. Alexandre Dumas Junior's most famous characters were inspired by his father's life.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 12‚Äì14.

Craig Bell argues for Porthos in Alexandre Dumas: A Biography and Study (London: Cassell and Co., 1950), 7. The general's grandson, Alexandre Dumas, fils, would become one of France's most celebrated playwrights of the second half of the nineteenth century. Another grandson, , who was never recognized by the novelist Dumas, was a prominent left-leaning theater critic in the same period.Marcel Cerf, Le mousquetaire de la plume: La vie d'un grand critique dramatique, Henry Bau√´r, fils naturel d'Alexandre Dumas, 1851‚Äì1915 (Paris: Acad√©mie d'Histoire, 1975.). The General's great-grandson, , son of Henry Bau√´r, was also an accomplished writer in the twentieth century. A great- great-grandson, Alexandre Lippmann (grandson of the playwright Dumas fils), was a two-time gold medalist in fencing at the 1908 and 1924 Olympic games (he won silver in 1920). Ancestry Born 25 March 1762 in J√©r√©mie, Saint- Domingue (today Haiti), Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie was the son of a French nobleman, the Marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie (Antoine) (20 June 1714, Belleville-en-Caux‚Äì15 June 1786, Saint-Germain-en- LayeDeath certificate of Alexandre-Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie in Saint- Germain-en-Laye, 16 June 1786, Mus√©e Alexandre Dumas (Villers-Cotter√™ts, France).) and Marie-Cessette Dumas (birth date unknown; d. 1772, La Guinod√©e, Saint-DomingueTom Reiss, The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012), 54.), an enslaved African woman he owned.

The Davy de la Pailleteries were provincial Norman aristocrats whose wealth was in decline.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, 24. The family had acquired the title of \\"lords\\" (seigneurs) by 1632.Fernand Gaudu, \\"Les Davy de La Pailleterie, seigneurs de Bielleville-en-Caux, Rouen,\\" Revue des Soci√©t√©s savantes de Haute-Normandie, no. 65 (1972), 43. The French kingdom granted the title \\"marquis\\" to the family by 1708.Robert Landru, √Ä propos d‚ÄôAlexandre Dumas: Les a√Øeux, le g√©n√©ral, le bailli, premiers amis (Vincennes: R. Landru, 1977), 22. Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie (\\"Antoine\\") had two younger brothers, Charles Anne Edouard (Charles) born in 1716, died 1773 (married 1738 to Anne- Marie Tuff√©), and Louis Fran√ßois Th√©r√®se (Louis) born in 1718, died 1773. All three were educated at a military school and pursued careers as officers in the French military. They first served during the War of the Polish Succession. Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, who reached the rank of colonel, notably saw action at the Siege of Philippsburg in 1734. =Career in Saint- Domingue= In 1732, Antoine's younger brother Charles had been given a military posting in Saint-Domingue, a French colony in the Caribbean that generated high revenues from its sugarcane plantations, worked by African slave labor. In 1738, Charles left the military to become a sugar planter in that colony; he married Anne-Marie Tuff√©, a rich local French Creole widow, and took over her estate. That year Antoine also left the Army and joined his brother and his wife in Saint-Domingue. He lived with them and worked at the plantation until 1748. After the two brothers quarrelled violently, Antoine left Charles's plantation, taking his three personal slaves. At that point Antoine broke off contact with his brother and his family for a period of thirty years.Count de Maulde‚Äôs request at the Parliament, 30 November 1778, Archives d√©partementales du Pas-de-Calais (Dainville and Arras, France), 10J35. During that time, Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie purchased the slave woman Marie-Cessette \\"for an exorbitant price\\" and took her as a concubine. In 1762, she gave birth to their mixed-race son Thomas-Alexandre. During her time with Antoine, she also had three daughters with him. (Some accounts say two.) The French colonist made a living in J√©r√©mie, Saint-Domingue as a coffee and cacao planter, under the assumed name of \\"Antoine de l'Isle\\". When the brothers‚Äô parents, the Marquise Jeanne-Fran√ßoise and the Marquis Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, died in 1757 and 1758, respectively, Charles returned to Normandy to claim the title of Marquis and the family ch√¢teau. The British blockade of French shipping during the Seven Years' War reduced Charles' income from sugar exports, so he tried to smuggle the commodity out of Saint- Domingue from his plantation. He used a wharf in the neutral border territory (and tiny island) of Monte Cristo (today Monte Christi, Dominican Republic). (Some historians argue that this Monte Cristo was the \\"real\\" island that inspired Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo.Tom Reiss, The Black Count: Glory, Revolution, Betrayal, and the Real Count of Monte Cristo (New York: Crown Publishers, 2012), pp. 13‚Äì14 and 49; Gilles Henry, \\"Alexandre Dumas, Les dessous d'une l√©gende: La v√©ritable histoire de Monte-Cristo,\\" Historia Magazine, (May 2002), 42‚Äì67.) Charles died of gout in 1773;Leroux to Maulde, 8 July 1773, Archives d√©partementales du Pas-de-Calais (Dainville and Arras, France), 10J26. Louis, the youngest of the Davy de la Pailleterie brothers, died three months later. He had served a 15-day sentence for being involved in selling defective weapons to the French military (a famous scandal at the time known as the Invalides Trial [le proc√®s des Invalides]).Gilles Henry, Les Dumas: Le secret de Monte Cristo (Paris: France-Empire, 1999), 47.

Others have suggested African origins of the names Cessette and Dumas, including Gabon or Dahomey.Albert M‚ÄôPaka, F√©lix Ebou√©, 1884‚Äì1944, gouverneur g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique √©quatoriale fran√ßaise: Premier r√©sistant de l'Empire: Grand Fran√ßais, grand Africain (Paris: Editions L'Harmattan, 2008). Note: The francophone novelist Calixthe Beyala suggested that the name ‚ÄúDumas‚Äù was initially ‚ÄúD√ªma‚Äù, of Fang origin, meaning ‚Äúdignity‚Äù.Hans Werner Debrunner, Presence and Prestige, Africans in Europe: A History of Africans in Europe before 1918 (Basel : Basler Afrika Bibliographien, 1979.), 128. Note: Debrunner suggests she was more likely of Yoruba or Dahomey origin, given slave trading patterns. The two extant primary documents that state a racial identity for Marie-Cessette Dumas refer to her as a \\"n√©gresse\\" (a black female) as opposed to a \\"mul√¢tresse\\" (a female of visible mixed race). Secondary sources on General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, dating back to 1822, almost always describe his mother as a black African (\\"femme africaine\\",Antoine-Vincent Arnault, Antoine Jay, Etienne de Jouy, and Jacques Marquet de Norvins, ‚ÄúDumas (Alexandre Davy-de-la-Pailleterie),‚Äù in Biographie nouvelle des contemporains, v. 6 (Paris, 1822), 160; Marie Nicolas Bouillet, Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de g√©ographie, 9th ed., pt. 1 (Paris: Librairie de L.

Two documents signed by Alexandre Dumas‚Äîhis contract and certificate of marriage to Marie-Louise Labouret‚Äîstate that Marie-Cessette died in La Guinaud√©e, near Trou J√©r√©mie, Saint-Domingue, in 1772. Based on this death date, Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson speculates that she may have died in the mass outbreak of dysentery following a hurricane that struck principally the Grand Anse region of Saint-Domingue that year.Victor Emmanuel Roberto Wilson, Le g√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas: Soldat de la libert√© (Sainte-Foy, Quebec: Les Editions Quisqueya-Qu√©bec, 1977), 49‚Äì51. Two other documents attest that Marie-Cessette was alive after 1772: a letter recounting her sale in 1775 and an 1801 document signed by Dumas, saying that \\"Marie-Cezette\\" will be in charge of General Dumas's properties in Saint-Domingue.‚ÄúPar-devant le notaire public du departement de Seine-et-Oise [...] √©tait present Thomas Dumas Davy de La Pailleterie, connu et nomin√© Dumas, general de division, demeurant a Villers-Cotter√™ts, departement de l'Aisne [...].

Thomas-Alexandre Dumas may have earlier claimed that she had died in order to avoid having to get her approval before marriage and revealing her slave status. In addition, he was in a hurry to leave for the military front.Claude Ribbe, Le diable noir: Biographie du g√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas, 1762‚Äì1806, p√®re de l'√©crivain (Monaco: Alph√©e, 2008 and 2009), 14‚Äì15. Names Dumas used several names in his life: Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie,Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 91 Thomas Rethor√© (or Retor√©), Alexandre Dumas, Alex Dumas, and finally Thomas-Alexandre Dumas-Davy de la Pailleterie. \\"Davy de la Pailleterie\\" is his father's family name. He used the name \\"Retor√©\\" (sometimes spelled Rethor√©) during and for some years after the period in which his father sold him and then re-purchased him (1775‚Äì1776). According to the biographer Tom Reiss, the name Retor√© \\"was perhaps picked up from a neighbor in J√©r√©mie (where the name can be found on official records of the period)\\".Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 57 The name Dumas is from his mother. The first record of his use of the name \\"Alexandre Dumas\\" is his entry in the registry book of the Queen's Dragoons, which he joined on 2 June 1786.Registry of the Dragoons in the Regiment of the Queen, Dumas entry, 2 June 1786, privately held by Gilles Henry. (It was known in his platoon that this was \\"not his real name\\".Ernest Roch, ‚ÄúLe G√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas,‚Äù Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Historique de Villers-Cotter√™ts 2 (1906), p. 91, quoted by Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 109.) He used the simple form \\"Alex Dumas\\" starting in 1794.The first letter he signed \\"Alex Dumas\\" appears to be General Dumas to Minister of War Bouchotte, 11 January 1794, Service historique de la D√©fense (Vincennes, France), 3B9. General Dumas used the full name \\"Thomas-Alexandre Dumas-Davy de la Pailleterie\\" on his son's birth certificate.Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 4. Appearance The enlistment roll-book for the 6th Regiment of the Queen's Dragoons, which Dumas joined in 1786, described him as \\"6 feet tall, with frizzy black hair and eyebrows... oval face, and brown skinned, small mouth, thick lips\\".Registry of the Dragoons in the Regiment of the Queen, Dumas entry, 2 June 1786, privately held by Gilles Henry, quoted Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 91 According to the earliest-known published description of him (1797), he was \\"one of the handsomest men you could ever meet. [...] His frizzy hair recalls the curls of the Greeks and Romans.\\" It described his face as 'something closer to ebony' than to 'bronze.'\\"Author unknown, ‚ÄúLe g√©n√©ral Alexandre Dumas, homme de couleur,‚Äù n.d. [1797], Biblioth√®que nationale de France, NAF 24641, quoted by Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 325 Elsewhere General Dumas has been described as 'dark‚Äîvery dark.'Arthur Davidson, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re: His Life and Works (Philadelphia: Lippincott, 1902), 4. Early life Thomas-Alexandre had two siblings by his parents: Adolphe and Jeannette. They also had an older half-sister, Marie-Rose, born to Marie- Cessette before Davy de la Pailleterie purchased her and began their relationship. His father sold Marie-Cessette and her other three children before arranging to take Thomas-Alexandre with him to France. In 1776 when Alexandre was fourteen years old, his father sold the boy for 800 French livres in Port-au-Prince, officially to a Lieutenant Jacques-Louis Roussel (but unofficially to a Captain Langlois). This sale (with right of redemption) provided both a legal way to have Alexandre taken to France with Langlois and a temporary loan to pay for his father's passage. The boy accompanied Captain Langlois to Le Havre, France, arriving on 30 August 1776, where his father bought him back and freed him.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 54‚Äì55. From his arrival in France until Autumn 1778, Alexandre (then using the name Thomas Retor√©) first lived with his father at the Davy de la Pailleterie family estate in Belleville-en-Caux, Normandy. After his father sold that estate in 1777, they moved to a townhouse on the rue de l'Aigle d'Or in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. There, Alexandre studied at the academy of , where he was given the higher education of a young nobleman of the time. At this school, he learned swordsmanship from the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, another mixed-race man from the French Caribbean.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 59. Flush with cash from the sale of his family estate, Davy de la Pailleterie for many years spent lavishly on Dumas. His notary said that the boy \\"cost him enormously\\".Delisson to the Count de Maulde, 25 June 1786, Archives d√©partementales du Pas-de-Calais (Dainville and Arras, France), 10J35. From 1777 to 1786, from age 15 to 24, thanks to his father's wealth and generosity, Dumas lived a life of considerable leisure. In 1784, at age 22, Alexandre moved to an apartment on Rue Etienne, near the Louvre Palace in Paris, socializing at venues such as the Palais-Royal and Nicolet's Theater. In September 1784, while seated at Nicolet's Theater in the company of \\"a beautiful Creole\\" woman, he and his companion were harassed by a white colonial naval officer, Jean-Pierre Titon de Saint-Lamain, and one or two others. Following Dumas's verbal protests, the men \\"tried to force him to kneel before his attacker and beg for his freedom\\". The police report on the incident shows that Titon chose not to press charges as he might have, and all participants were released.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 83‚Äì87. Military career Enlistment and service in the Queen's Dragoons In February 1786 his father Davy de la Pailleterie married Fran√ßoise Retou, a domestic servant from the Davy de la Pailleterie estate.Marriage contract between Marie Retou and Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, 13 February 1786, privately held by Gilles Henry. Dumas did not sign as witness to the marriage contract. According to his son's memoir, the marriage precipitated a \\"cooling off\\" which led the father to tighten Dumas's allowance.Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 21. Soon after, Dumas decided to join the French Army, a common occupation for gentlemen. Unlike his noble peers, who took arms as commissioned officers, Dumas enlisted as a private. A 1781 rule enabled men who could show four generations of nobility on their father's side to qualify to be commissioned as officers. Dumas had this, but the French race laws \\"made it hard for a man of mixed race to claim his rightful title or noble status\\".Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 91‚Äì92. Note: One law required non-whites living in Paris to carry special identification. A 1780 law prohibited non-whites from using the titles \\"Sieur\\" or \\"Madame.\\") According to the novelist Dumas's account, on hearing of Alexandre's plan, his father insisted that his son take a \\"nom de guerre\\" in order that he not drag the noble name \\"through the lowest ranks of the army\\".Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 21‚Äì22. He signed up for the 6th Regiment of the Queen's Dragoons as \\"Alexandre Dumas\\" on 2 June 1786; thirteen days later, his father died. Dumas spent his first years in the Queen's Dragoons in the provincial town of Laon, Picardy, close to the border with the Austrian Netherlands. On 15 August 1789, following the beginning of the French Revolution, his unit was sent to the small town of Villers-Cotter√™ts. The town's newly formed National Guard leader, innkeeper Claude Labouret, had called for them to come in response to a wave of rural violence known as the Great Fear. Dumas lodged at the Labourets' H√¥tel de l'Ecu for four months, during which time he became engaged to Claude Labouret's daughter Marie-Louise.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 102‚Äì115. Dumas's regiment was in Paris on 17 July 1791, where they served as riot police along with National Guard units under the Marquis de Lafayette during the Champ de Mars Massacre of the French Revolution. Troops killed between 12 and 50 people when a large crowd gathered to sign a petition calling for the removal of the French king. When, two years later, someone denounced Dumas to the Committee of Public Safety, he claimed that his intervention in the conflict had saved as many as 2,000 people from massacre.Reiss, The Black Count, pp. 120, 156‚Äì157. A corporal by 1792, Dumas had his first combat experience in a French attack on the Austrian Netherlands in April of that year. He was one of 10,000 men under the command of the General Biron. Stationed on the Belgian frontier in the town of Maulde, on 11 August 1792 Dumas captured 12 enemy soldiers while leading a small scouting party of four to eight horsemen.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 129-130. Second-in- command of the Black Legion In October 1792, Dumas accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel in (and second-in-command of) the , founded a month earlier by Julien Raimond. This was a \\"free legion\\" (i.e., formed separately from the regular army) composed of free men of color (gens de couleur libres). It was variously called the \\"American Legion\\", the \\"Black Legion\\", or the Saint- Georges Legion, after its commanding officer, the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, Dumas's former instructor in swordsmanship. The young officer Dumas frequently commanded the legion, as Saint-Georges was often absent from duty. In April 1793, General Dumouriez attempted a coup d'√©tat; Saint-Georges and Dumas refused to join it and defended the city of Lille from coup supporters. In the summer of 1793, Saint-Georges was accused of misusing government funds, and the Legion was disbanded.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 133‚Äì145 Commander-in-chief of the Army of the Western Pyrenees On 30 July 1793, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in the Army of the North. One month later, he was promoted again, to general of division. In September, he was made commander-in-chief of the Army of the Western Pyrenees.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 145‚Äì146, 150. In this brief assignment (September‚ÄìDecember 1793), Dumas's headquarters were in Bayonne, France, where (according to his son's memoirs), he was nicknamed \\"Mr. Humanity\\" (Monsieur de l'Humanit√©) by local sans-culottes; they wanted to intimidate him to conform to their political line at a time when French generals were extremely vulnerable to accusations of treason that often led to execution.Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 40, quoted by Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 152. Commander-in-chief of the Army of the Alps On 22 December 1793, Dumas was given command of the Army of the Alps.National Convention decree, 22 December 1793, Service historique de la D√©fense (Vincennes, France), 7YD91, and memo published in Le Moniteur, 24 December 1793, reprinted in R√©impression de l‚Äôancien Moniteur, Vol. 19 (1863); Executive Council decree, 28 December 1793, Mus√©e Alexandre Dumas (Villers- Cotter√™ts, France), cited Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 152‚Äì153 His campaign in the Alps centered on defeating Austrian and Piedmontese troops defending the glacier-covered Little Saint Bernard Pass at Mont Cenis, on the French-Piedmont border. After months of planning and reconnaissance from his base in Grenoble, he had to wait for snow conditions to be favorable to his troops' passage. In April and May 1794, Dumas launched several assaults on Mont Cenis. In the final attack, Dumas's army, equipped with ice crampons, took the mountain by scaling ice cliffs and captured between 900 and 1,700 prisoners.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 160‚Äì176. Though his victory won Dumas praise from political leaders in Paris, he was called before the Committee of Public Safety in June 1794, for reasons unspecified but probably to face charges of treason, as this was the period of the \\"Great Terror\\", a period of accelerated political executions in the final months of the Reign of Terror period of the French Revolution. Dumas delayed his arrival in Paris until mid-July, and was lucky enough not to be seen by the Committee before the Terror ended with the execution of Robespierre on 27 July 1794. Thomas- Alexandre Dumas, c.1800, in Republican Army uniform Commander-in-chief of the Army of the West (1793) in the Vend√©e In early August 1794 Dumas was briefly assigned (for two weeks) to command the military school at Neuilly- sur-Seine near Paris.114) S. H. A. T., G. D. 2/S 91, Dossier Dumas de la Pailleterie (Thomas Alexandre), ampliation du 15 thermidor an II, cited by Erick No√´l, ‚ÄúUne carri√®re contrari√©e: Alexandre Dumas, homme de couleur et g√©n√©ral r√©volutionnaire,‚Äù Etudes Fran√ßaises, no. 5 (March 1998), 69‚Äì70. He was reassigned to lead the Army of the West from August to October 1794. In this position, he was responsible for consolidating the recent government victory over a massive insurgency in the region of the Vend√©e against the French revolutionary government. He focused on increasing military discipline and eliminating soldiers' abuses of the local population.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 177‚Äì183 One historian, despite or because of his pro-royalist sentiments, would characterize Dumas in this command as \\"fearless and irreproachable\\", a leader who \\"deserves to pass into posterity and makes a favorable contrast with the executioners, his contemporaries, whom public indignation will always nail to the pillory of History!\\"Henri Bourgeois, Biographies de la Vend√©e militaire: Alexandre Dumas (Lu√ßon, France: M. Bideaux, 1900), 23, quoted in Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 181. General in the Army of the Rhine (France) In September 1795 Dumas served under General Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber in the Army of the Rhine. He participated in the French attack on D√ºsseldorf, where he was wounded.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 183. General in the Army of Italy =Siege of Mantua= General Dumas joined the Army of Italy in Milan in November 1796, serving under the orders of its commander-in-chief, Napoleon Bonaparte. Tension between the two generals began in this period, as Dumas resisted Napoleon's policy of allowing French troops indiscriminately to expropriate local property. In December 1796, Dumas was put in charge of a division besieging Austrian troops at the city of Mantua. By Christmas he had intercepted a spy carrying a message to the Austrian commander with important tactical information. On 16 January 1797, Dumas and his division halted an Austrian attempt to break out of the besieged city and prevented Austrian reinforcements from reaching Mantua. The French were thereby able to maintain the siege until French reinforcements could arrive, leading to the city's capitulation on 2 February 1797.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 190‚Äì204. =Campaign in Northern Italy= Following the 16 January fighting, Dumas felt insulted by the description of his actions in a battle report by General Berthier, Bonaparte's aide-de-camp, and wrote a letter to Napoleon cursing Berthier. Dumas was subsequently omitted from mention in Napoleon's battle report to the Directory, France's government at the time. He was then given a command well beneath his rank, leading a subdivision under General Mass√©na, despite a petition from Dumas's troops attesting to his valor. Under General Mass√©na in February 1797, Dumas helped French troops push the Austrians northward, capturing thousands of them. It was in this period that Austrian troops began calling him the der schwarze Teufel (\\"Black Devil\\", or Diable Noir in French).Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 204‚Äì207. In late February 1797, Dumas was transferred to a division commanded by General Joubert, who specifically requested Dumas out of admiration for his republicanism. Under Joubert, Dumas led a small force that defeated several enemy positions along the Adige River. Dumas's crowning achievement in this period came on 23 March, when the general single-handedly drove back an entire squadron of Austrian troops at a bridge over the Eisack River in Clausen (today Klausen, or Chiusa, Italy). It was this feat for which the French began referring to Dumas as \\"the Horatius Cocles of the Tyrol\\" (after a hero who had saved ancient Rome). Napoleon called Dumas by this nickname, and rewarded him by making him cavalry commander of all French troops in the Tyrol; he also sent Dumas a pair of pistols. Dumas spent much of 1797 as military governor, administering the province of Treviso, north of Venice.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 206‚Äì214. Commander of Cavalry in the French Campaign in Egypt Dumas was ordered to report to Toulon, France in March 1798 for an unspecified assignment. He joined an enormous French armada massing there in preparation for departure to a secret destination. The armada departed on 10 May 1798, destination still unannounced. It was only on 23 June, after the fleet had conquered Malta, that Napoleon announced that the mission's main purpose: to conquer Egypt. Aboard the Guillaume Tell, in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Dumas learned that he had been appointed as commander of all cavalry in the Army of the Orient. The armada arrived in the port of Alexandria at the end of June, and on 3 July Dumas led the Fourth Light Grenadiers over the walls as the French conquered the city. After the fighting, Napoleon sent Dumas to pay ransom to some Bedouins who had kidnapped French soldiers. The expedition's chief medical officer recounted in a memoir that local Egyptians, judging Dumas's height and build versus Napoleon's, believed Dumas to be in command. Seeing \\"him ride his horse over the trenches, going to ransom the prisoners, all of them believed that he was the leader of the Expedition.\\"Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 218‚Äì237. From 7 to 21 July, Dumas commanded the invading army's cavalry as it marched south from Alexandria to Cairo. Conditions of heat, thirst, fatigue, and lack of supplies for the troops on the desert march were harsh; there were a number of suicides. While camped in Damanhour, General Dumas met with several other generals (Lannes, Desaix, and Murat). They vented criticisms of Napoleon's leadership and discussed the possibility of refusing to march beyond Cairo. Dumas soon participated in the Battle of the Pyramids (following which he chased retreating Mameluke horsemen) and the occupation of Cairo. At some point during the occupation, Napoleon learned of the earlier mutinous talk, and confronted Dumas. In his memoirs, Napoleon remembered threatening to shoot Dumas for sedition. Dumas requested leave to return to France, and Napoleon did not oppose it.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 240‚Äì251 Napoleon was reported to have said: \\"I can easily replace him with a brigadier.\\"J. Christopher Herald, Bonaparte in Egypt (London: H.H. Hamilton, 1962), 213. Following the destruction of the French armada by a British fleet led by Horatio Nelson, however, Dumas was unable to get out of Egypt until March of the following year. In August 1798, Dumas discovered a significant cache of gold and jewels beneath a house in French-occupied Cairo, which he turned over to Napoleon. In October, he was instrumental in putting down an anti-French revolt in Cairo by charging into the Al-Azhar Mosque on horseback. Afterward (according to his son's account, drawn largely from the memories of Dumas's aide-de-camp Dermoncourt), Napoleon told him: \\"I shall have a painting made of the taking of the Grand Mosque. Dumas, you have already posed as the central figure.\\" The Girodet painting, however, which Napoleon commissioned eleven years later, shows a white man charging into the mosque.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 260‚Äì263. On 7 March 1799, Dumas boarded a small ship called the Belle Maltaise in the company of his fellow General Jean-Baptiste Manscourt du Rozoy, the geologist D√©odat Gratet de Dolomieu, forty wounded French soldiers, and a number of Maltese and Genoan civilians. Dumas had sold the furnishings of his quarters in Cairo, and purchased 4,000 pounds of moka coffee; eleven Arabian horses (two stallions and nine mares) to establish breeding stock in France; and hired the ship.John G. Gallaher General Alexandre Dumas: Soldier of the French Revolution (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1997), 114‚Äì118; Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 262‚Äì263. While returning to France, the ship began to sink, and Dumas had to jettison much of his cargo. The ship was forced by storms to land at Taranto, in the Kingdom of Naples. Dumas and his companions expected to get a friendly reception, having heard that the Kingdom had been overthrown by the Parthenopean Republic. But that short-lived republic had succumbed to an internal uprising by a local force known as the Holy Faith Army, led by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, in alliance with King Ferdinand IV of the Kingdom of Naples. He was at war with France.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 264‚Äì272. Imprisonment in the Kingdom of Naples The Holy Faith Army imprisoned Dumas and the rest of the passengers and confiscated most of their belongings. Early on in the captivity, Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo tried to trade Dumas for a Corsican adventurer named Boccheciampe, an imposter posing as Prince Francis, son of Ferdinand IV, in order to aid the Holy Faith movement. Boccheciampe had been captured by French forces north of the Neapolitan kingdom, shortly after he had visited the prisoners in Taranto, but Ruffo lost interest in a trade when he learned Boccheciampe had been killed by the French. Dumas was malnourished and kept incommunicado for two years. By the time of his release, he was partially paralyzed, almost blind in one eye, had been deaf in one ear but recovered; his physique was broken. He believed his illnesses were caused by poisoning. During his imprisonment, he was aided by a secret local pro- French group, which brought him medicine and a book of remedies. In November 1799, Napoleon had returned to Paris and seized power. Dumas's wife lobbied his government for assistance in finding and rescuing her husband, to little result. Napoleon's forces, under the command of Dumas's fellow general Joachim Murat, eventually defeated Ferdinand IV's army and secured Dumas's release in March 1801.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 264‚Äì303. Political views Dumas made few political statements, but those he made suggest deeply felt republican beliefs. One month after the French National Convention abolished slavery (4 February 1794), Dumas sent a message to troops under his command in the Army of the Alps: > Your comrade, a soldier and General-in-Chief ... was born in a climate and > among men for whom liberty also had charms, and who fought for it first. > Sincere lover of liberty and equality, convinced that all free men are > equals, he will be proud to march out before you, to aid you in your > efforts, and the coalition of tyrants will learn that they are loathed > equally by men of all colors.Dumas to his ‚Äúbrothers in arms,‚Äù March 6, 1794, > SHD 3B9, quoted by Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 159. Marriage and family On 28 November 1792, stationed with the Black Legion in Amiens, Dumas married Marie-Louise √âlisabeth Labouret in Villers- Cotter√™ts.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 139‚Äì141. She stayed in Villers- Cotter√™ts with her family during his military campaigns. Dumas bought a farm of 30 acres there. They had daughters Marie-Alexandrine (born 10 September 1794), Louise-Alexandrine (born January or February 1796, died 1797), and a son, Alexandre Dumas, who became a prolific and notable author, with numerous successes in plays and especially adventure novels. Later years and death After he finally gained release in 1801, Dumas was not awarded \\"the pension normally allocated to the widows of generals\\" by the French governmentGeneral Alexandre Dumas to First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, 17 October 1803, and Marie-Louise Labouret-Dumas to the minister of war, 2 October 1814, both in Service historique de la D√©fense (Vincennes, France), 7YD91. and he struggled to support his family after his return to France.General Alexandre Dumas to First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, 29 September 1801, cited in Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 193 He repeatedly wrote to Napoleon Bonaparte, seeking back-pay for his time lost in Taranto and a new commission in the military.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 318. He died of stomach cancerCharles Glinel, Alexandre Dumas et son oeuvre (Reims, 1884), 23. on 26 February 1806 in Villers-Cotter√™ts.Alexandre Dumas's death act, 27 February 1806, Mus√©e Alexandre Dumas (Villers-Cotter√™ts, France). At his death his son Alexandre was three years and seven months old. The boy, his sister, and his widowed mother were plunged into deeper poverty.Marie-Louise Labouret-Dumas to Madame Carmin, 4 December 1806, Mus√©e Alexandre Dumas (Villers-Cotter√™ts, France). Marie-Louise Labouret Dumas worked in a tobacconist's shop to make ends meet.Antoine-Vincent Arnault, Antoine Jay, Etienne de Jouy, and Jacques Marquet de Norvins, ‚ÄúDumas (Alexandre Davy-de-la-Pailleterie),‚Äù in Biographie nouvelle des contemporains, v. 6 (Paris, 1822), 162. For lack of funds, the young Alexandre Dumas was unable to get even a basic secondary education. Marie-Louise persistently lobbied the French government to be paid her military widow's pension.Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 233. Marie-Louise and the young Alexandre blamed Napoleon Bonaparte's \\"implacable hatred\\" for their poverty.Marie-Louise Labouret-Dumas to the minister of war, 2 October 1814, Service historique de la D√©fense (Vincennes, France), 7YD91 and Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, Mes m√©moires, v. 1 (Paris, 1881), 231. Legacy and honors *Dumas's name is inscribed on the south wall of the Arc de Triomphe. *In 1913, a statue of General Dumas was erected in Place Malesherbes (now Place du G√©n√©ral Catroux) in Paris in Autumn 1912 after a long fundraising campaign spearheaded by Anatole France and Sarah Bernhardt. From the moment of its installation until some time after July 1913 the statue was covered by a shroud due to the difficulty of the numerous governmental agencies involved to reach agreement on the modalities of its official inauguration. It stood in Place Malesherbes for thirty years, alongside statues of Alexandre Dumas's descendants Alexandre Dumas, p√®re (erected in 1883) and Alexandre Dumas, fils (erected in 1906), as well as one of Sarah Bernhardt. The Germans destroyed it in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942, and it has never been restored.Reiss (2012), The Black Count, pp. 327‚Äì329. *In 2009, a sculpture in his honor, made by Driss Sans-Arcidet, was erected in Paris, Place du G√©n√©ral Catroux (formerly Place Malesherbes). Representing broken slave shackles, it was unveiled on 4 April 2009. The critic Jean-Jo√´l Br√©geon has claimed that the symbolism of the statue was not appropriate because of his noble upbringing, the general had never been a slave.Jean-Jo√´l Br√©geon, La Nouvelle Revue d'Histoire, No. 42 (May‚ÄìJune 2009). Documents cited above, however, show that his father sold and then re-purchased Alexandre Dumas, disproving this claim. Dumas biographer Tom Reiss has suggested that the monument is inappropriate for other reasons: \\"In the race politics of twenty- first-century France, the statue of General Dumas had morphed into a symbolic monument to all the victims of French colonial slavery ... There is still no monument in France commemorating the life of General Alexandre Dumas.\\"Reiss (2012), The Black Count, p. 330. *In April 2009, the writer Claude Ribbe started an internet petition, asking French President Nicolas Sarkozy to award General Dumas the L√©gion d'honneur. As of February 2014, the petition has gathered over 7,100 signatories.

The result is that various parties, e.g., the State, other businesses and consumers, have borne the cost of this misbehaviour and the associated business risks.

Abandonia also features a music section and an Abandonware List, a slowly expanding database of over 4600 games including information about their publishers, release dates and whether according to the staff's knowledge the software is sold, protected or \\"abandoned\\". This list is a sum total of research and inquiries made by the site's volunteer workforce and its users, with sources including MobyGames, Wikipedia and the company registry at Home of the Underdogs. Reloaded is a sister project of Abandonia, with the focus upon freeware and \\"freemake\\" (free, remade) games. Every game showcased is accompanied by a set of screenshots, and reviews written and often proof-read by the site's forum members. Both Abandonia and Reloaded are community-driven projects. With the exception of the featured games themselves, advertising and current site coding, all content available on both sites is created by the community as a volunteer effort. There has not been any intervention by the Abovo Group since 2015. Only the Abovo Media Group (an attempt to continue the previous corporate incarnation, Studentis, by Andreas Swahn) are paid for the distribution of any software, or for any member's choice to provide content or volunteer effort at the site. Both also have a game evaluation system, in which games are rated by a site reviewer and any regular visitors that might happen to try the game. Despite Abandonia.com reporting a sum total of 3 members of staff and asking for donations of 5 Euros per visitor, the actual revenue, from advertising and other methods, on Abandonia, Reloaded and the associated downloads brings in around 1,200e (~$1340) per month. The sites together are worth less than 15,000 Euros ($35,000), despite the seven-fold drop in traffic in the past few years. User visitor stats have shown a slight increase over the past year (2019) in particular, with almost 4,000 daily visitors to Abandonia and 3,000 to Reloaded. From these 7,000 visitors, mainly from USA, Holland and Australia, there are now fewer than 4% (160) downloads from the site file servers per day. 15 years ago, this was a very different situation, and the site thrived and was even host to the first ever Minecraft competition online, offering, in conjunction with Markus Persson aka Notch, free keys for premium versions for winning entries. This marked decrease can be attributed to the increase in online distributors such as GOG.com and publishers who maintain the IP rights for this software, updating and packaging the software in a \\"user friendly\\" format, for a comparatively low price for the privilege of \\"golden era\\" gaming, DRM free (of which many of these abandonware games on offer were not, or used old cracks and were not optimised for play on modern machines - provided \\"as is\\" with no support). Abandonia currently averages a total of 3 pageviews per visitor (1 landing, 1 \\"not available\\", 1 referral to GOG.com), an average of 2 minutes on site and a 58.1% bouncerate, likely from the number of adverts causing such long loading times, or the continuous [DDOS] attacks that have plagued the site for the past years. GOG.com ranks Abandonia as one of its highest referral sites, according to Alexa. Reloaded does not host its own files. As a freeware site, it redirects to the game-maker's download site directly. Compared to its competitors (many of whom offer these games for download, or to play in browser), Abandonia can be seen to be little more than a catalogue of games that gains revenue from adverts and via sponsored links to sites where these games are for sale, maintained by a few members. History Abandonia was created by Croatian, Kosta Krauth on June 21, 1999. At that time Abandonia was an oldwarez site, with games such as Monkey Island and Doom available for download, even though these games were still being sold in stores. The site gained a major boost in popularity throughout 2003 and 2004 as a discussion forum was opened, updates became more frequent, and the focus shifted towards abandoned games in lieu of the piracy and copied crack files, during the early days of expansion of internet access. At the present time Abandonia has been translated into German, Spanish, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish, Italian, Danish, Polish, Croatian, Norwegian, Slovene, Icelandic, Greek, Slovak and Romanian, in addition to the main English. Other translations currently being worked on include Hebrew and Russian. In July 2010, Abandonia was acquired by Abovo Media Group, a Swedish internet media company. Abovo Media Group took over the hosting responsibilities for Abandonia and support of its upcoming versions. Since 2010 the Abovo Media Group team led by Rafiq Ahmed, Andreas Swahn, Steven Harding and Abdul Majid has managed the development, maintenance and support of the site. Between 2006 and 2010, Abandonia was owned by Studentis Group, a Swedish online community company. Studentis handled the hosting responsibilities for Abandonia and supported its upcoming versions. In October 2007 Abandonia received a new layout and was transferred over to the Drupal platform by Kosta Krauth and the Studentis team consisting of Andreas Swahn, Marcus Johansson, Daniele Testa, Fredrik Holm and Carl McDade. However, access to all site functions was never clearly handed-over and even to this day, the initial design flaws from Kosta Krauth persist due to this. The introduction of advertisements to the site was seen as an inconvenience by many of its users. By this time, however, so many other abandonware sites had opened (including those that do not care if a title is sold or not) that many of the site volunteers and users have slowly moved away from Abandonia, leaving it abandoned by all but the most stubborn of long-suffering volunteers and a diminishing community (albeit with a rich archive, with particular regard to troubleshooting of older games). Data breach In November 2015, the website's database was breached, allowing attackers to gain information on 776,000 accounts registered on the site. The data contained email and IP addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes of passwords. This hack was made public by website Have I Been Pwned? on June 5, 2017, via a front-page announcement. It was not deemed necessary to inform each member via their confirmed, sign-up email addresses, nor was an enforced password change deemed necessary. The incident, however, was reported as a news article on the site's main page. This breach was (and not made known to the over 770,000 members to the leak of usernames, emails, passwords and IP addresses used) due to an organised smokescreen, to gain administrator access and force server switches as part of a joint cybercrimes operation, so to expose and bear evidence for prosecution upon a child-teen pornography allegation, that Abandonia's previous operators had been operating within Studentis' various student chat, and other, sites, for several years prior. The time between the leak being made public and the site \\"staff\\" and administration being unaware ‚Äì coupled with several \\"slow lorris\\"-type DDOS attacks at the time, allowed for the link to be established that there was some connection between Studentis' site and the servers that hosted those that contained materials of the original investigation into allegation. This method was considered to be best approach in order to effect the server switch to one that contained the offending materials, without alerting any member involved that it was an action with intention to do so. As the offending servers were \\"hidden from the public eye\\" (although still operational to this day, pending a similar outcome to Operation Poweroff), it was necessary to force Abandonia to be hosted for a short time on a \\"backup\\" server (upon which the offending materials did reside), therefore allowing a direct connection to be made‚Äîone without implicating Abovo Media. No warning was possible or made, as the founding members and those of Studentis' administration were on this list. The site staff are volunteers and, as such, were unaware of anything above daily operation. No conviction has been made as of 2019, trial pending further investigation as from dissolution of Studentis and formation of Abovo media by Andreas Swahn. However, offending materials and related sites have been seized and are closed. This was an operation performed in collaboration between Openbaar Ministerie, Politie Europol and J-CAT, in conjunction with key figures of the newly formed Abovo Group. The breach has led to a new spate of phishing emails \\"passphrase abandon\\" originating from a Russian spam server in the past months. It is not unlikely that many of Abandonia members, whose emails and passwords were leaked at the time, would have or will be receiving such emails (from July 2018 - date). It appears as if the site, due to its association, is subject to many, minor attempts at closure, despite its innocence and ignorance in this matter. Software hosted on Abandonia Abandonia's definition of abandonware is one of the more clearly defined in the abandonware scene. In order for a game to be considered abandoned - therefore legally hosted on the site for download - it has to pass three criteria: :*First, the game has to be unavailable on the retail market and no longer distributed by its publishers nor in any format by legitimate retailers. :*Second, official support for the game, by both its publisher and developer, must have ended. :*Third, the game must not be under active protection of any anti-piracy agency, such as Entertainment Software Association, nor directly by the copyright holders themselves. If a legitimate copyright holder for any game requests its removal - any downloads of the game (or links to thereof) present on the site or its forum will be subject to removal by site staff (although the review of the game will still remain onsite). :Only the PC version of the game needs to fulfill the above three criteria: whether any console versions do or do not is considered irrelevant. Despite Abandonia's declaration that it follows a strict policy to not deal with ROMs or disk images for non-PC systems, there is much to be found on the subject, if not the files themselves. If the site staff discovers that one of the games placed on the site no longer fulfils one of those criteria or has been qualified as Abandonware when it was not, downloads of the game is remove on Abandonia's own initiative. In order to facilitate status identification for games not yet introduced in its abandonware list, the staff of Abandonia relies on an updated list of known ESA member and subsidiary companies, that can be found incorporated in the ruleset of the site's Requests forum.  Reloaded  Reloaded (previously \\"Abandonia Reloaded\\") is a sister project of Abandonia dedicated to the development and distribution of freeware games. It was created on 2005-05-07 by Kosta \\"Sellout\\" Krauth, Monica \\"Taikara\\" Schoenthaler, Maikel \\"GTX2GvO\\" Kersbergen & Tom \\"Totalitarian\\" Henrik Aaberg. None of these four have been active or involved in Abandonia nor Reloaded for some years. The site is maintained by small number of volunteer staff, for the Abovo Media Group, most of whom are (or have previously been) involved with the original Abandonia. History The concept for Abandonia Reloaded was conceived by Kosta \\"Sellout\\" Krauth, Abandonia's owner, in 2004, in order to separate independently produced freeware from the abandonware already featured on Abandonia. He was joined by Maikel \\"GTX2GvO\\" Kersbergen and Tom \\"Totalitarian\\" Henrik, both already admins for Abandonia. Soon after, Monica \\"Taikara\\" Schoenthaler was invited to join the team. These four are listed as the original \\"Founders\\" of Abandonia Reloaded. Its library of games initially consisted of Adventure genre titles, but was later expanded to include other genres, with both old commercial games released as freeware (such as The Elder Scrolls: Arena, The Black Cauldron and Beneath a Steel Sky), and later independent freeware (such as Ark 22, Trilby's Notes and Enclosure). On October 14, 2010, it was announced that \\"Abandonia Reloaded\\" was to be renamed \\"Reloaded\\". There has been some hostility between the two sites, in the past, despite both working towards what might be considered the same goal and operated by the same sets of volunteers.

It has some of the most spectacular alpine climbing in Canada. The Spire was first climbed by Conrad Kain in 1916. Routes * Northeast Ridge (D-, 5.8) :The east face of Bugaboo Spire.This route tackles the right-hand skyline in the east face photo. Gain the Bugaboo/Crescent col by making your way up the Crescent Glacier to its highest point and scrambling (4th class) up the extreme left side of a slabby grey-green area for about 180m. You are then on the ridge joining Crescent and Bugaboo; follow blocks and a large crack up this to the \\"rope-up terrace\\", a white area where dykes on the east face join the ridge. From here, 12 pitches up to 5.8 (or so) gain the north summit. A few meters before the north summit, a rappel (pitons) down the east face about 6m takes you to a ledge. Follow this behind a large boulder and more ledges to a flat area south of the north summit. Follow an exposed 4th class ridge down about 160m to a col and then follow cracks in the slab ahead to a distinct notch. From here, you can rappel down ramps to the south and follow ledges to above the gendarme on the Kain route. Alternatively, you can climb horizontal cracks above at 5.10 to the south summit. From either place, follow the Kain route down; 6 or so rappels and some 4th + 3rd class downclimbing. One of the \\"50 Classic Climbs of North America\\" * Kain Route (PD+, 5.6) This route tackles the left-hand skyline in the east face photo as is commonly used as the descent route for all routes on the spire. After gaining the Bugaboo- Snowpatch col, 3rd class scrambling starts up the ridge following trails and cairns. As height is gained, the route sticks close to the ridge-crest but is always on the Kain Hut basin side of the peak. After a while, some low-5th- class chimneys are reached with a wide, flat ledge at the base. These are scaled in one long (~60m) pitch or two shorter ones; a rappel station exists halfway up. At the top, a section of 4th class ridge is traversed for about 150m to the base of the gendarme-pitches. There is a bolted station at a notch just after the 4th-class terrain. Two pitches (or one long one) from here start up the ridge crest, follow horizontal cracks on the right (east) side past a few old pitons and cross over the ridge to the west side near the top on a lower-angled slab. Cross the slab (with a small roof above it) and gain a corner, which leads to the left side of the gendarme (there is a bolted rappel station on the gendarme). From here, follow a ledge/gully system up left and then back right to the south summit. The descent is somewhat different: rappel from the south summit, then from the gendarme on the EAST side (not the way you came up) about 25m to a ledge. Scramble up to a notch between a flake and rappel about 20m diagonally to another station and another, similar rappel from which a few metres of scrambling gains the ridge at the beginning of the 4th class section. Traverse this to the one 60m or two 30m rappels down the chimneys. Retrace the ascent route from here, being careful to stay far enough skier's-right (despite trails and some cairns to the contrary).

This h√¥tel has long been attributed to Jacques Gabriel as well as Aubert (e.g., Blondel 1752, vol. 1, p. 205; Kimball 1943, p, 148), but recent work has shown that Aubert was the designer. If Gabriel played any role, it was as a consultant. Since 1919 it has housed the Mus√©e Rodin, dedicated to the work of Auguste Rodin. Grounds as depicted on the 1739 Turgot map of Paris Blondel's Architecture fran√ßoise (1752) History Construction and early modifications The h√¥tel was built for a financier,Rogers, Chris (2018) How to Read Paris. London: The Ivy Press. pp.60-61. Abraham Peyrenc de Moras, who had speculated successfully in the ill-fated paper money schemes of John Law that had ruined many, at a time when the Faubourg Saint-Germain was still suburban in character. His house, the most superb in the neighborhood, was built as a free-standing structure, not entre cour et jardin (\\"between entrance court and garden\\") with party walls against adjoining buildings, as h√¥tels in more densely built quarters of Paris were traditionally built since the seventeenth century. The house is still surrounded by three hectares (7.3 acres) of grounds. The house had boiseries carved in the full-blown rococo manner and has two elliptical salons that form attached pavilions at the corners of the garden front. There were sixteen medallions or overdoor paintings by Fran√ßois Lemoyne, premier peintre du roi, enframed in the paneling. The H√¥tel Peyrenc-de-Moras, as it then was, was completed in 1732, just a year before Peyrenc's death. His widow leased the house to the duchesse du Maine, who had married a natural son of Louis XIV; she took possession in January 1737 (Kimball loc. cit.) and made some minor changes.The h√¥tel was illustrated in Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel, Architecture fran√ßaise, II (1752), pls. 205-207. Documents were published by J.Vauquier, Ancienne h√¥tel du Maine et de Biron, Paris 1909 (Kimball)Gady 2008, p. 208. Upon the death of the duchess in 1753, the mansion became the property of the mar√©chal de Biron, hero of Fontenoy, whose name it has carried. A plan of the house and gardens as they were in 1752Illustrated at the Mus√©e Rodin website. shows the deep terrace at the rear with a few wide bowed steps that led to matching parterres containing shaped compartments set in gravel and surrounded by shrubs tightly clipped in cones which flanked a wide central gravel walk. To the left of the deep cour d'honneur and entered from it, neatly clipped cabinets de verdure‚Äîsmall open-air rooms and recesses in fanciful shapes, connected by short galleries‚Äîwere cut into solid greenery. To the right of the court was a subsidiary stable courtyard. Soon the gardens were swept away by the duc de Biron, in favour of a miniature park √† l'Anglaise, achieved with trelliswork. When the \\"comte du Nord\\", the future Paul I of Russia, and his countess (who were traveling technically incognito for pleasure) visited Paris in 1782, they toured the garden, \\"one of the wonders of Paris, admiring the beauty of the flowers and the variety of the borders. They walked among the flower beds and the shrubberies, marvelling at the boldness and elegance of the trellis work forming gateways, arcades, grottoes, domes, Chinese pavilions...\\"Contemporary document quoted at the Mus√©e Rodin website. Conversion to school By the end of the eighteenth century, the faubourg was becoming demod√©, with the westward development of fashionable Paris on the Rive Droite. The duc de Biron's heir, Armand Louis de Gontaut, duc de Lauzun, was guillotined in 1793. During Napoleon's reign, the H√¥tel de Biron was the seat of the Papal legate and then of the Russian ambassador. In 1820 it was given to the Soci√©t√© du Sacr√©-Coeur de J√©sus, whose Dames du Sacre-Coeur, dedicated to the education of young women, converted the hotel into a boarding school for girls from aristocratic families. They stripped the house of all luxuries, mirrors and boiseries and added a chapel. Closure of school and conversion to museum Under the 1905 French law on the separation of Church and State, however, the school was forced to close. The house was subdivided into lodgings, and plans were afoot to demolish the mansion entirely and replace it with a block of flats. Auguste Rodin rented several rooms on the ground floor in which to store his sculptures. The rooms became his studio; there he worked and entertained friends among the overgrown gardens. In 1909, Rodin, at the height of his fame, began to agitate for the H√¥tel Biron to become a museum of his work. Some restoration work was carried out in 1911‚Äì1912 by the architect Henri Eustache. Rodin proposed to make a bequest of his property, his archives and the contents of his studio at the time of his death, and the French government accepted in 1916. The museum opened in 1919. Recent history Since World War II, the Mus√©e Rodin has been able to buy back boiseries and decorative paintings formerly in the house, which were stripped out by the Dames du Sacre-Coeur and sold.Ayers 2004, p. 147. In the 1980s the museum was able to buy two of Lemoyne's overdoors, Venus Showing Cupid the Ardour of his Arrows (acquired in 1985) and the Labours of Penelope (acquired in 1989), and restore them to their original positions.\\"Autres actualit√©s (2012)\\", Mus√©e Rodin.

Antonine baths ruins, from the Roman period After the destruction of Punic Carthage in 146 BC, a new city of Carthage (Latin CarthƒÅg≈ç) was built on the same land. By the 3rd century, Carthage developed into one of the largest cities of the Roman Empire, with a population of several hundred thousand.Likely the fourth city in terms of population during the imperial period, following Rome, Alexandria and Antioch, in the 4th century also surpassed by Constantinople; also of comparable size were Ephesus, Smyrna and Pergamum. Stanley D. Brunn, Maureen Hays-Mitchell, Donald J. Zeigler (eds.), Cities of the World: World Regional Urban Development, Rowman & Littlefield, 2012, p. 27 It was the center of the Roman province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the empire. Carthage briefly became the capital of a usurper, Domitius Alexander, in 308-311\\\\. Conquered by the Vandals in 439,p.402 Carthage served as the capital of the Vandal Kingdom for a century. Re-conquered into the Eastern Roman Empire in 533/4, it continued to serve as an Eastern Roman regional center, as the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa (after 590 the Exarchate of Carthage). The city was sacked and destroyed by Arabs after the Battle of Carthage in 698 to prevent it from being reconquered by the Byzantine Empire. It remained occupied by a garrison during the Muslim period and was used as a fort by the Muslims until the Hafsid period when it was taken by Crusaders with its defenders killed during the Eighth Crusade. The Hafsids decided to destroy its defenses so it couldn't be used as a base by a hostile power again. Roman Carthage was used as a source to provide building materials for Kairouan and Tunis in the 8th century. Foundation Roman villas, Carthage By 120 - 130 BC, Gaius Gracchus founded a short-lived colony, called Colonia Iunonia, after the Latin name for the Punic goddess Tanit, Iuno Caelestis. The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The Senate abolished the colony some time later to undermine Gracchus' power. After this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by Julius Caesar in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the first century, it had grown to be the fourth largest city of the empire, with a population in excess of 100,000 people. It was the center of the province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the Empire. Among its major monuments was an amphitheater, built in the 1st century, with a capacity of 30,000 seats. Early Christianity Carthage also became a center of early Christianity. Tertullian rhetorically addressed the Roman governor with the fact that the Christians of Carthage that just yesterday were few in number, now \\"have filled every place among you ‚Äîcities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods.\\" (Apologeticus written at Carthage, c. 197). In the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the Donatist controversy, which Augustine of Hippo spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the Council of Carthage, the Biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed. The Christians at Carthage conducted persecutions against the pagans, during which the pagan temples, sanctuaries and holy sites, notably the famous Temple of Juno Caelesti, were destroyed.Brent D. Shaw: Sacred Violence: African Christians and Sectarian Hatred in the Age of Augustine Vandal period The Vandals under their king Genseric crossed to Africa in 429,Collins, Roger (2000), \\"Vandal Africa, 429‚Äì533\\", XIV, Cambridge University Press, pp. 124 either as a request of Bonifacius, a Roman general and the governor of the Diocese of Africa,Procopius Wars 3.5.23‚Äì24 in Collins 2004, p. 124 or as migrants in search of safety. They subsequently fought against the Roman forces there and by 435 had defeated the Roman forces in Africa and established the Vandal Kingdom. Genseric was considered a heretic, too, an Arian, and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him. The Vandals during their conquest are said to have destroyed parts of Carthage by Victor Vitensis in Historia Persecutionis Africanae Provincia including various buildings and churches. Byzantine period After two failed attempts (Majorian, Basiliscus) to recapture the city in the 5th century, the Empire finally subdued the Vandals in the Vandalic War of 533‚Äì534. Using Gaiseric's grandson's deposal by a distant cousin, Gelimer, as either a valid justification or pretext, the Romans dispatched an army to conquer the Vandal kingdom. On Sunday, October 15, 533, the Roman general Belisarius, accompanied by his wife Antonina, made his formal entry into Carthage, sparing it a sack and a massacre. Thereafter, the city became the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa, which was made into an exarchate during the emperor Maurice's reign, as was Ravenna on the Italian Peninsula. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Roman Empire, all that remained of its power in the West. In the early seventh century, the exarch of Carthage overthrew the Roman emperor, Phocas. Islamic conquest The Exarchate of Carthage was first assaulted by the Muslim expansion initiated from Egypt in 647, without lasting effect. A more protracted campaign lasted from 670 to 683. In 698, the Exarchate of Africa was finally overrun by Hassan Ibn al Numan and a force of 40,000 men. Fearing that the Eastern Roman Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy Roman Carthage in a scorched earth policy and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, its water supply cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbors made unusable. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to Roman rule in the region since BCE 2nd century. It is visible from archaeological evidence, that the town of Carthage continued to be occupied. The neighborhood of Bjordi Djedid continued to be occupied. The Baths of Antoninus continued to function in the Arab period and the historian Al-Bakri stated that they were still in good condition. They also had production centers nearby. It is difficult to determine whether the continued habitation of some other buildings belonged to Late Byzantine or Early Arab period. The Bir Ftouha church might have continued to remain in use though it is not clear when it became uninhabited. Constantine the African was born in Carthage. The fortress of Carthage was used by the Muslims until Hafsid era and was captured by the Crusaders during the Eighth Crusade. After repulsing them, Muhammad I al-Mustansir decided to completely destroy Carthage's defenses to prevent a repeat.

At the age of seven she became a pupil of Hans Hilf, who had studied in the master class of Walther Davisson at the Leipzig Conservatory. From the age of twelve Renate Eggebrecht studied violin with Friedrich W√ºhrer and piano with Wilhelm Rau at the L√ºbeck College of Music. She continued her training at the Munich College of Music. Subsequently she devoted herself to private studies with Prof. Wolfram K√∂nig, attending master classes with Max Rostal, Seymion Snitkovsky and chamber music courses with the LaSalle Quartet. In 1986 Renate Eggebrecht founded the Fanny Mendelssohn Quartet with which she gave the World Premiere Performance of Fanny Hensel born Mendelssohn‚Äôs Piano Quartet in A-flat Major (1822) on March 6th 1988 in the Cultural Center Gasteig in Munich and the first Munich performance of the String Quartet in E-flat Major (1834) by this composer. In 1988 she published the first editions of these chamber music works (Furore Verlag, Kassel). In order to publicize unknown and forgotten music, Renate Eggebrecht founded the music production firm of Troubadisc as a label for Classical music in 1991. For this label she made world premiere CD recordings of chamber music by Fanny Hensel born Mendelssohn, Ethel Smyth, Germaine Tailleferre, Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz and other women composers. In 1993 Renate Eggebrecht produced the complete songs of the French composer and pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, their first release on CD, and similarly the instrumental and piano songs of Ethel Smyth in 1997. Besides Fanny Hensel born Mendelssohn‚Äôs chamber music, Eggebrecht also produced the composer‚Äôs songs in 2001, and in 1998, with the pianist Wolfram Lorenzen, the piano cycle Das Jahr (\\"The Year\\") based on the composer‚Äôs fair copy as a CD world premiere. With her ensemble, Eggebrecht recorded Darius Milhaud‚Äôs String Quartets nos. 1 - 8 for CD in 1994-5, as well as his works Machine agricoles op. 56 and Catalogue de Fleurs op. 60. In 1996 she issued also CD recordings by the Fanny Mendelssohn Quartet of the two large string quartets by Arthur Bliss . In 1997, together with the German pianist Wolfram Lorenzen, Eggebrecht was able to present the CD recordings, in three volumes, of Edition Max Reger‚Äôs Piano Chamber Music. She subsequently devoted herself to recording Max Reger‚Äôs complete works for violin solo, which she presented in 2003. Eggebrecht has contributed greatly as a chamber musician to the discovery of worthwhile music by neglected composers. In 2000 she issued, together with the cellist Friedemann Kupsa, the world premiere recording of the Sonata for violin and violoncello (1947) by the Greek Schoenberg pupil Nikos Skalkottas, and the Sonatina op. 324 by Darius Milhaud. With Friedemann Kupsa she presented in 2002 the world premiere of the Duo-Sonata (1985) by the Romanian avant-garde composer Anatol Vieru and the \\"Strassenmusik No 16\\", op. 210 (2001) by the Greek composer Dimitri Nicolau. Her experience with the music of the twentieth century in the area of chamber music provided Renate Eggebrecht with excellent prerequisites for dealing with the new expressive possibilities of the violin as a solo instrument. In order to make available to the listening public the compositions for violin alone that were written from the beginning of the twentieth century to the present day, the violinist Renate Eggebrecht initiated the edition \\"VIOLIN SOLO\\" in 2002. A sequence of works already becomes evident, beginning with Max Reger‚Äôs Chaconne op. 117, over Bach's Sei Solo and extending to the present day: A compendium of the modern violin literature. Renate Eggebrecht‚Äôs violin is a Stradivarius copy by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume from 1858; her favorite bow is by Jules F√©tique.

It was first published in the February 1956 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and has been reprinted several times, including in In Deep (1963), The Science Fiction Hall of Fame (vol. 1) (1976), and The Golden Age of Science Fiction (1981).Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections Plot The story is set in a future world in which violence and crime have been almost entirely eradicated. The main character is a man who is capable of antisocial behavior and who considers himself ‚Äúthe king of the world.‚Äù He is allowed to do what he wishes, take what he wants and go where he pleases without reprisal, so long as he does no violence to another human being. The ‚Äúhumane, permissive‚Äù society in which he lives has adopted a threefold solution for someone who is, by their standards, insane. The first is excommunication - no one is to interact with him or even acknowledge his existence, other than by the apparent worldwide directive identifying him and calling for this punishment. Secondly, he is thrown into an epileptic seizure whenever he attempts to commit violence against another human. Thirdly, his body and waste give off a highly offensive odor, undetectable by him, to identify him, warn others of his presence and drive them away. The story ends with a desperate plea from the protagonist for someone, anyone to join him in his rebellion against what he perceives to be a wholly passive society, which has lost any spark of creativity or will to achieve greatness. The story links violence to artistic expression.

It is measured from via . The station is managed by Southern. History The original Reigate stations were located two miles from the town centre in a hamlet then known as Warwick Town but which later became Redhill. Red Hill and Reigate Road station was opened by the London and Brighton Railway on 12 July 1841. The nearby town was then served by a horse-drawn omnibus service operated by the railway. This was followed on 26 May 1842 by the South Eastern Railway (SER) Red Hill station (later misleadingly renamed 'Reigate'). Both these stations closed on 15 April 1844 when a new joint Redhill and Reigate station opened on the site of the present Redhill railway station. The current Reigate station opened 4 July 1849 with the opening of the branch line from Redhill to Reigate by the Reading, Guildford and Reigate Railway; the original station building from that time is still in use today. The station was initially called Reigate Town. The station was operated by the SER until 1898, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway until 1922, the Southern Railway (UK) until 1947 and British Railways until 1997. The line to Redhill to Reigate was electrified on 1 January 1933 but the remainder remains unelectrified. Services The station is managed by Southern, who are one of two train operators from the station alongside Great Western Railway. Southern As of February 2020, Southern operates services to and from via , which start and terminate at Reigate. These services have intermediate stops at Redhill, , , , and . Since May 2018, these services run half-hourly on weekdays and Saturdays, and hourly on Sundays;https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the- railway/timetabling/electronic-national-rail-timetable/ (Timetable No. 183 May 2018) this is a significant improvement, as previously Southern served Reigate with only one train per hour six days a week with no Sunday service. Great Western Railway Great Western Railway operates two trains per hour eastbound to (one train per hour continues one stop further to ) and two trains per hour westbound to via (one semi-fast, one stopping), seven days a week. The semi-fast westbound services call only at , Guildford, , and before terminating at Reading; the stopping services call at most intermediate stations.Association of Train Operating Companies - official timetable Route table Layout The station has two platforms, numbered from left to right when looking towards Redhill.Station facilities for Reigate - National Rail Enquiries Platform 1 is long enough for an eight-car train but platform 2 can only accommodate up to six carriages. The platforms are connected by a subway. Platform 1 is served by through services going eastbound towards Redhill and Gatwick Airport. Platform 2 is used by all westbound services towards Dorking, Guildford and Reading, as well as by eastbound services to Redhill and London that originate at Reigate. Future In 2020, Network Rail announced that they are planning to upgrade Reigate station, which includes constructing a new 12-carriage bay platform (number 3) on the south side of the station, and extending the existing platform 2 to also accommodate 12-car trains.Reigate station upgrade - Network RailConnect Reigate to Thameslink - Network RailReigate station set for third platform meaning direct trains to London Bridge - Surrey Live Currently the track layout just east of the station forces Southern to turn its trains around on platform 2, and since this platform is not long enough to accommodate 8-car sets, Southern services to and from Reigate are limited to 4 carriages in length. The upgrade would enable longer trains to serve the station, and the new bay platform would allow trains to/from London to terminate there instead of occupying the through westbound track, thus improving reliability on the whole line. Once the upgrade is delivered, there are further proposals to introduce Thameslink services running to , and beyond to destinations north of London, replacing the current Southern services to London Victoria. Signal box Reigate Signal Box The station also incorporates a signal box, built in 1929 to replace an earlier box at the other end of the station. This remains in use to operate the Level crossing gates and other signals along the North Downs Line.

The 2,894-seat, three-tiered theatre was designed by Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager and opened in 1929 as a movie palace for motion pictures and vaudeville. Today it is one of New York's leading live music and entertainment venues, under the management of the Madison Square Garden Company. The theater was the site of the 2011, 2012, and 2016 Tony Awards. History The Beacon Theatre was originally conceived by film producer Herbert Lubin in 1926 as part of a projected chain of deluxe New York City movie palaces. The planned Roxy Theatre Circuit was to be operated by Lubin and Samuel L. \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel with the famous Roxy Theatre as its flagship. Planned as the Roxy Midway Theatre, the future Beacon was designed by Walter W. Ahlschlager of Chicago, the architect of the 6000 seat Roxy, as a smaller mate to the larger Times Square theater. However, the collapse of Lubin's fortunes doomed the Roxy scheme and the Midway was never opened. The nearly completed theater sat vacant for a time and was eventually acquired by Warner Theatres to be a first-run showcase for Warner Bros. films on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The renamed Warner's Beacon Theatre opened on December 24, 1929. Designed as a silent film showplace, the theater's delayed opening featured a talking picture (Tiger Rose with Lupe V√©lez), silent films having already become obsolete. Note: This includes and Accompanying 11 photographs Later operated by Brandt Theaters, the Beacon continued as a primarily first-run movie theater into the early 1970s. In 1974, Steven Singer bought the theater to present live pop concerts promoted by Stephen Metz. They were followed by Marvin Getlan and Allen Rosoff who bought the theater in 1976 and continued its new life as a major presenter of live concerts, including a series of 1976 concerts by the Grateful Dead. In November 1977 the Beacon hosted a performance of Erik Satie's symphonic drama Socrate in tribute to the mobile artist Alexander Calder, featuring a recreation of Calder's set for a 1936 production of the work.Calders Sets in N.Y \\"Socrate\\" The Hour October 26, 1977 It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1987, an effort to convert the theater into a nightclub was blocked in court on the grounds that it would irreparably damage the theater's historic and protected architecture. Subsequently, the theater underwent a revival in its concert hall business, filling New York's low-to-mid-sized venue notch between the larger Radio City Music Hall and various smaller clubs and ballrooms. The Madison Square Garden Company began operating the Beacon in 2006.Cablevision Leases Beacon Theater In November 2006, the theater began a 20-year lease by Cablevision, which also leases Radio City Music Hall and owns Madison Square Garden. The company announced a planned $10 million renovation of the theater. Entertainment The Allman Brothers Band The Allman Brothers Band opening night in 2009 celebrating their 40th anniversary at the Beacon In late September 1989, the Allman Brothers Band played four shows at the Beacon Theatre. They played 10 nights in spring 1992, and played from 8 to 19 shows each spring in the nineteen following years, except for in 2010, when the band could not play at the theatre. They chose to record a live album at the theatre in March 2000, and released Peakin' at the Beacon on November 14, 2000 on the Epic label. In 2009, the Allman Brothers Band celebrated its 40th anniversary by inviting famous musical guests from an impressive array of genres to perform with them at the Beacon Theatre. Dedicated to the band's founder and original frontman, Duane Allman, the engagement lasted three weeks rather than three-days, as in previous years. Some of the invitees included Eric Clapton, Boz Scaggs, and Levon Helm, formerly of The Band, who arrived the first day with his own drum kit. Clapton had invited Duane Allman to perform with Clapton's band, Derek and the Dominos, on its 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs' In January 2010, the Beacon's management announced it would be unable to accommodate the Allman Brothers Band that year because it had booked an extended run of a new Cirque du Soleil production, forcing the band to move its annual New York engagement to a new venue, the United Palace Theater. According to The New York Times, at that time the Allmans had played \\"190 shows over the past 20 years\\" at the Beacon, beginning in 1989. After the Cirque du Soleil show closed sooner than planned, the Allman Brothers were invited back to the Beacon Theatre in 2011 and played 13 shows from March 10 to 26. The show of March 25 was their 200th at the Beacon. The band played the final show of its career at the Beacon Theatre on October 28, 2014.

Under its marquee is an exterior lobby with tile flooring extending to the sidewalk along Broadway between 74th and 75th Streets, across from the Beaux-Arts Ansonia Hotel. Entry is gained through its bronze-doored vestibule into an opulent two-story circular lobby. White marble floors give way to mahogany bars on both the orchestra and mezzanine levels, and two more levels provide access to both the foot and top of its steeply inclined upper balcony. Exquisite detailing abounds throughout, including elaborate gilded plaster moldings, polished hardwood, and brass staircase rails. Corridor murals depict atmospheric Eastern scenes of trading caravans complete with elephants, camels and other animals.

The film is about mistaken identity getting in the way of recovering a stash of diamonds that was stolen and subsequently hidden more than 20 years earlier. Plot The film is told primarily in flashback, as the film first follows a hitman, Critical Jim (Tim Allen), who follows and holds at gunpoint a man he believes is Cletis Tout (Danny Lima) - but who actually is Finch (Christian Slater). Because Critical Jim is so fond of film noir and other classic films (such as Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's), he's willing to listen to Finch as he tells his story, imagining it as a film in progress. Finch obliges, explaining how he got to be mistaken for Cletis Tout. Finch happened to be in the same jail with Micah (Richard Dreyfuss), who stole diamonds more than 20 years before, then hid the diamonds and soon landed in prison. With Finch's help, Micah manages to break out, and the two get new identities for themselves, courtesy of a coroner (Billy Connolly) who owes Finch a favor. The problem is that Finch's new identity is that of Cletis Tout, a photojournalist who managed to film a Mafia figure's son strangling a woman. The head of the Mafia gets his men to kill Tout (which is how the coroner got the identity for Finch), but when Finch goes to Tout's apartment to look for his passport, a neighbor calls the police, who inform the mafia head that Cletis Tout is still alive. After Micah meets up with his now grown- up daughter, Tess (Portia de Rossi), he's accidentally shot by the men sent to kill Cletis. Just before dying, Micah gets Finch to promise to watch after his daughter, and thus Tess and Finch begin an uneasy relationship as they look for the diamonds. Meanwhile, the Mafia head decides to bring in a professional hit man, so he contacts Critical Jim to finish the job. Critical Jim is more interested in where Finch's story will end - specifically, if he'll be able to reconcile with Tess in the end, giving the story a perfect Hollywood ending.

It is the smallest of South Africa's 18 National Parks, covering an area of 27.86 km2 The park is part of the Cape Floristic Region, which is a World Heritage Site. The park is located 6 km south of Swellendam, in the foothills of the Langeberg Mountains. It is bordered to the south by the Breede River. The bontebok Bonteboks are rare, unusually marked antelopes. They are listed as vulnerable in Appendix II of the International Trade in Endangered Species Red List. They are endemic to the Cape Floral area, and once roamed the region in large numbers. European settlement and hunting brought the animal to near extinction by the early 19th century. A relict population was protected on private farmland. In 1931, seventeen members of this population were translocated to the first Bontebok National Park. In the 1960s, half of the population died from worm infestations, copper deficiency and related syndromes. In 1961, 61 members of the surviving population were translocated to the current Bontebok National Park. The worldwide bontebok population of 2,500‚Äì3,000 individuals are all derived from this population. However, there are only about 200 bontebok in the park, as this is the maximum number a park of its size can support without inflicting serious damage to plant life. Over the years the park's surplus stock has been translocated to other nature reserves and private owners with suitable habitats. Other species found in the park Conservation in the park include the protection of the endangered fynbos veld type and the coastal renosterveld, one of the largest remaining \\"renosterveld islands\\", which contains several plant species that are found nowhere else in the world. In total, the park has nearly 500 grasses and other plant species. Other indigenous species in the park include the African clawless otter, Stanley's bustard, Secretary bird and the Blue crane, South Africa's national bird. Grey Rhebok, Cape Grysbok, Duiker, Red Hartebeest and Cape Mountain Zebra can also be found here. There are over 200 species of birds.

Activities in the Park Bontebok National Park lacks major predators or other large dangerous animals, and thus allows several outdoor activities. These include self-navigated game drives, a large picnic area, fishing, swimming and kayaking on the Breede River, mountain biking (along reserve's gravel roads, or a dedicated 9 km MTB trail) and several marked walking/hiking trails. Three hiking trails start near the rest camp (accessible for day visitors from a dedicated parking area, or via a short link path from the overnight camp): *The Acacia Trail is a circular route of approximately 1.6 km which is mostly flat, circling through acacia veldt *The Aloe Hill Trail is a circular route of approximately 3.3 km (2.7 km if leaving from the rest camp) which passes the original building of Lang Elsie's Kraal (c. 1734-1800) before climbing a small hill, returning along the river with a few easy rocky scrambles *The Bushbuck Trail, a 5.4 km out-and-return route along the river from the trailhead to Die Stroom (the picnic area) and return Further inland from the river, the Blue Crane Trail is a 3.2 km route along a jeep track, passing some of the small dams. A fifth circular trail of about 6 km, the Termite Loop, commences near Die Stroom and climbs a long gentle incline before crossing Western Drive and descending back to the river. The Park is a good location for birding, with over 200 species recorded. Large species commonly see here are the Denham's (Stanley's) Bustard, Blue Crane, Spur-winged Goose and Secretary Bird. Other noteworthy species are Malachite and Southern Double-Collared Sunbird, Fiscal Flycatcher, Klaas's Cuckoo, Acacia Pied Barbet, Red-faced Mousebird and Pearl-breasted Swallow. Day visitors can access all areas of the park except for the Lang Elsies Kraal Rest Camp. However, a dedicated picnic area at Die Stroom has ablutions, braai (barbecue) facilities, a children's play area, and access to the river to swim, fish or kayak. Accommodation in the Park All accommodation is located at the Lang Elsie's Kraal Rest Camp, on the banks of the Breede River. Fourteen one- and two- bedroom wooden cottages are complemented by multiple camping stands, available with or without electricity points. Stands suitable for caravans are also available. All accommodation booking is through SANParks.

He was the brother of King Louis XV's influential mistress Madame de Pompadour. Early life Non-noble by birth, Abel-Fran√ßois Poisson de Vandi√®res was raised in a family of Parisian financiers. When his elder sister, Jeanne- Antoinette Poisson became, in 1745, the official mistress of Louis XV and was given the title \\"marquise de Pompadour\\", she had him follow her to the court, where the young man attracted the favours of the king. When Philibert Orry retired, the king arranged for Abel-Fran√ßois Poisson de Vandi√®res - then aged 18 - to inherit the direction of the B√¢timents du Roi (\\"direction g√©n√©rale des B√¢timents, Arts, Jardins et Manufactures\\"), while Charles Fran√ßois Paul Le Normant de Tournehem, believed to be the marquise de Pompadour's biological father, was named as Orry's immediate successor. Charles Antoine Coypel, first painter to the king, was given the responsibility of training and educating the young Abel-Fran√ßois Poisson de Vandi√®res. With Coypel's help, Poisson de Vandi√®res chose paintings from the royal collection for exhibition at the Palais du Luxembourg, thus creating the first museum in France. Between December 1749 and September 1751, he spent twenty-five months in Italy, staying first at the Acad√©mie de France √† Rome, and then travelling (the so- called \\"Grand Tour\\") across the country with the engraver Charles Nicolas Cochin, the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and the abb√© Leblanc. This trip would have important repercussions on the development of arts and artistic taste in France. Work in the Palace At the death of Le Normant de Tournehem in 1751, Poisson de Vandi√®res was called back from Italy and took over his functions as \\"directeur g√©n√©ral des B√¢timents du Roi\\" (director general of the King's Buildings). He kept this position until his retirement in 1773, thereby setting a record for the longest administrative service in the 18th century in France. Irritable, boastful, easily angered, insecure about his humble origins, Marigny was nevertheless an intelligent and energetic administrator concerned with the importance of his work. He encouraged history painting and, in architecture, the return to classical sources, which would become French neoclassicism. He sponsored the architect Soufflot, whom he chose for the construction of the new √âglise Sainte- Genevi√®ve (today the \\"Panth√©on\\"), a major work in the neoclassical style. He gave oversight of the construction of the new Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais (today the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on) to Charles De Wailly and Marie-Joseph Peyre. He directed construction of the Place Louis XV (today the Place de la Concorde), the planting of the gardens of the Champs-√âlys√©es, and supervised construction of the √âcole Militaire. He gave numerous commissions to Fran√ßois Boucher, Charles-Am√©d√©e-Philippe van Loo, Jean-Baptiste Pierre and named Charles-Joseph Natoire as director of the Acad√©mie de France √† Rome. As Marquis de Marigny Having inherited from his father in 1754 the ch√¢teau of Marigny-en- Orxois, near Ch√¢teau-Thierry, he became the same year marquis de Marigny. In 1767, he married Julie Marie Fran√ßoise Filleul (1751-1822), the illegitimate daughter of Louis XV and Ir√®ne du Buisson de Longpr√©. The marquis de Marigny amassed an important collection of works of art at his various residences. Although he suffered severely from gout, the marquis de Marigny died unexpectedly in 1781 at Paris, leaving no will.

In service  The locomotives, numbered in the D1702-D1706 series, mainly worked from Tinsley depot in Sheffield on both passenger and freight work. In 1969, they moved to Norwich depot where they worked on express trains between there and London Liverpool Street. The 12LVA24 engine, however, was found to be unreliable and the locomotives spent more time out of service than their standard counterparts. Engine failures were common and repairs were often expensive. After conversion to Class 47s, they moved to Stratford depot, in East London, until they were displaced by examples fitted with electric train heating equipment. Subsequently, the batch went their separate ways to several depots.  Rebuilding  Eventually, it was decided not to continue with the 12LVA24 experiment; the engines were removed and the locomotives were fitted with the standard 12LDA28 engines. D1702 was the first to be so treated at Crewe Works, using parts from D1908 which had been withdrawn after a serious accident; it emerged back into service in December 1969. All five locomotives had been so converted by early 1971 and then became standard Class 47s. The power units were sold to SNCF and used in their Class A1AA1A 68000 locomotives.

He also created innovative interior designs, the most notable, the separation of private and public spaces for the Palais Bourbon in Paris.Kalnein 1995, pp. 53‚Äì56; Neuman 1996. Biography He was the son of Jean-Jacques Aubert, master carpenter in the B√¢timents du Roi, and was trained in the large atelier of Jules Hardouin-Mansart. Aubert was employed in the B√¢timents du Roi as a designer from 1703 (Kimball p 131); in 1707, Hardouin- Mansart had him appointed an architecte du Roi and attempted to get him seated in the second class of the Acad√©mie royale d'architecture.Aubert took his seat finally in 1720, upon the death of Armand-Claude Mollet. As a prot√©g√© of Hardouin-Mansart, Aubert may have come into conflict with Robert de Cotte, Hardouin-Mansart's successor as premier architecte though not as director at the B√¢timents du Roi. Diversifying his commissions, Aubert became the architect to the Bourbon-Cond√©: for them he worked on the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Maur (1709‚Äì10), the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly, and other lesser possessions. Chantilly Jules Hardouin-Mansart had provided Henri-Jules de Bourbon-Cond√© plans for the complete transformation of his Ch√¢teau de Chantilly. They were realized by Daniel Gittard, and by Aubert after 1708, though documentation for work other than for the stables is lacking (Kimball p 131). The destruction of these works at the Grand Ch√¢teau of Chantilly (begun in December 1718, according to Fiske Kimball) during the Revolution prevents an assessment of their nature, with the exception of the fine interiors of the Petit Ch√¢teau, which were sufficiently complete for the Regent to be lodged there 4 November 1722 at the return of the court from the coronation of Louis XV, and the famous stables, constructed for the duc de Bourbon, between 1719 and 1735. Plan of the Palais Bourbon, as designed by Aubert From 1724 Jean Aubert worked in Paris on the Palais Bourbon fronting the Seine, which was built for Louise Fran√ßoise de Bourbon (1673-1743), duchesse de Bourbon. The plans had been consigned to an Italian architect named Giardini, of whom little is known save that he died in 1722. Pierre Cailleteau Lassurance, who succeeded him in the project and designed the decor of the vestibule (Kimball 1943 p 130), died himself two years later. Aubert took up the project,\\"Par malheur,\\" wrote Pignol de la Force, \\"le plus habile est venu le dernier.\\" working with the already-established foundations, but redistributing the magnificently-finished apartmentsPierre-Jean Mariette said in 1740 \\"they surpass in ornaments and in magnificence everything that had been done until present\\" (quoted in Kimball, p 147) and introducing elliptical salons.Two elliptical salons at the extremities of the garden fa√ßade can be seen in Aubert's H√¥tel Peyrenc de Moras (de Biron), 1728-31. For the decoration of the interiors he was constrained to work with Jacques Gabriel, who had been introduced to the duchess's confidence by her advisor, Abraham Peyrenc de Moras. The Palais Bourbon has undergone many transformations since, but Aubert's work can be seen in six plates of Jean Mariette, Architecture fran√ßoise. Right next to the Palais Bourbon, Jean Aubert was also put in charge of the H√¥tel de Lassay, which Lassurance had also begun, for the marquis de Lassay, the lover of the duchesse de Bourbon. If the edifice came under some criticism, its interiors marked a step towards the freest rococo.D'Argenville, Voyage pittoresque de Paris 1762, attributed the execution of the interiors to \\"Goullon\\", the carver Dugoullons, who conducted a large atelier and provided work for the B√¢timents du Roi (Kimball, p 148, note, et passim). Garden facade of the H√¥tel Biron Between 1728 and 1731 Aubert constructed for the wealthy speculator Abraham Peyrenc de Moras the H√¥tel Biron, named for a later owner, which now houses the Mus√©e Rodin. Jacques Gabriel's role in its construction has recently been disallowed. In 1736, he built a little annex to the h√¥tel, which had been purchased from the widow of Peyrenc de Moras by the duchesse du Maine, herself a Bourbon-Cond√© by birth. Aubert's ch√¢teau for Chaalis Abbey Jean Aubert frequented the unofficial Acad√©mie du Petit-Luxembourg that was founded in 1729 by the comte-abb√© de Clermont, another member of the house of Cond√©, the younger brother of the builder of the stables of Chantilly. For the abb√©, who was abb√© commendataire of Chaalis, Aubert created the plans for the reconstruction of Chaalis Abbey in 1736. Begun in 1739 and intended as a large quadrangle, only the entrance wing with the abbot's residence was completed. Further work was halted in 1745 due to lack of funds and never resumed.Kalnein 1995, p. 56; Neumann 1996, p. 701. In 1738 Aubert built the lodgings at the Abbey of Fontevraud where Mesdames, the daughters of Louis XV, passed some years of their youth under the supervision of the abbesse de Montmorin. Jean Aubert married Genevi√®ve Brunault; the couple was childless. In Paris they lived in rue des Tournelles, probably in one of the buildings there that belonged to the heirs of Mansart.

The castle is located on the left bank of the Czarna Przemsza River. It was built in the 17th century and it is the oldest building in the city.  Architecture  Originally a defensive fortification, expanded in 1620 into a four-wing complex with corner towers, perhaps using earlier buildings. The castle was built of broken limestone and brick. Storey building with basement. After the fire in 1824, the castle was rebuilt in 1832, but the east wing with the entrance gate was demolished and the moats were filled. Despite these changes, the original defensive character is evidenced by the shape of the block, four corner towers and projections on the extension of the side wings. It is currently a three- winged building with an open courtyard.  History  The history of building the castle is not fully known. Until recently, it was believed that it was established in 1620, but thanks to archaeological research and queries in archives, it turned out that its origins date back to perhaps the 15th century . In 1620, Sebastian Minor of the P√≥≈Çkozic coat of arms completed the construction of a new castle on a quadrangle plan with a courtyard in the middle. This was commemorated with a plaque preserved until today in the chapel. The appearance of the castle from this period is presented in the inventories from 1665 and 1719. After Minory, the owners of Sielec were Modrzejewscy and Mƒôgoborski. During the reign of King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the castle belonged to Colonel Micha≈Ç ≈ªuli≈Ñski, and then to the chamberlain of the royal court of Jordan Stojewski, who in 1802 sold the castle to Prussian General Christian Ludwig Schimmelpfennig von der Oye. After his death in 1812, the widow in 1814 sold the castle to the prince of Pszczyna, Ludwik Anhalt-Coethen von Pless [1]. In 1824, the castle burned down, which meant that the prince commissioned its reconstruction based on plans prepared by J√≥zef Heintz, on the basis of which the east wing was demolished and the moats were filled [5]. In 1856, the building was bought by metallurgy entrepreneur Andreas von Renard from Strzelce Opolskie and in the hands of this family and the company associated with it, the castle remained until the Second World War as an office building. In the past, it was not only the seat of nobles, but also of Gwarectwa count. Renard and then Mining Museum and Contemporary Glass Museum. In 1994 the city of Sosnowiec took over the destroyed castle. Currently, the castle houses the \\"Sosnowiec Art Center - Sielecki Castle\\". This local government institution co-creates the cultural life of the city by organizing exhibitions, concerts and various culture- forming meetings.

Plot Small- time thieves 29-year-old Trish (Mary Stuart Masterson) and her 6-year-old niece Patsy (Lauren Suzanne Pratt) are at a diner, planning their next heist. Patsy tells her Aunt Trish that it's wrong that they are pick-pocketing people, but Trish believes it's okay in some way, and tells her that they only steal from \\"those who can afford it\\". Trish's former beau Mel (David Hewlett) comes to the diner to talk to Trish, being chased by two guys to whom he owes money. Trish and Patsy leave to go to Limbers department store. Patsy puts on a blond wig and begins to pick-pocket Mr. Limber (Lawrence Dane), the owner of the store. They are caught by security guard Bert (Mark Ruffalo). Trish and Patsy are brought to the office of Limber and threatened with arrest. But since it is almost Christmas, it's late Friday, and Social Services is already closed, Bert is to keep a watch over them at his place, though he protests doing so. After Christmas, on December 26, he is to return them back to the office, when Patsy is to be given to a foster-family who can better look out for her interests and Trish is to face charges. As the hours go by, Trish and Bert begin to develop an attraction for each other. As Christmas is \\"ruined\\" for Trish and Patsy, Bert takes them to Maplewood for his family's holiday dinner, and then to \\"Santa's Castle\\" where Patsy confesses her bad deeds to Santa's head elf (Howard Hesseman) and writes Santa a note, asking him to deliver her bicycle to Bert's apartment, where they've been staying. Very early in the morning on December 26, Bert rushes to Limbers to buy the bicycle, and Patsy is elated to find it delivered later that morn. But then Patsy is kidnapped by Mel, who wants to use her to pick-pocket at Limbers during the after-Christmas crowd's rush to return gifts. He is caught by Bert and everyone ends up back in the office where Social Services officials await them. But with Patsy's wish coming true, they get a second chance. Mel is hauled off to jail. Bert quits his job and proposes to Trish.

In his journey to Uganda, he was also a significant early traveler in the Sudan. He was later a parish priest in England. Biography Early life He was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, England, on 1847-12-07, son of William Pearson, a butcher, and his wife Sarah Johnson, and attended St. Bees Grammar School. Pearson had three brothers and two sisters. His younger brother Henry also became an Anglican priest. Seafarer He was a merchant seaman for some years, and served as an ordinary seaman on the Tenasserim, registered at Liverpool, for four voyages between 18 Oct 1867 and 29 Oct 1870. In 1872 he served as Third Mate on the Paraguay, and served as Second Mate on several vessels between 1872 and 1874. He qualified as First Mate in 1875, but joined the Brittania in London as second mate for a voyage to Lisbon 28 April 1875. She was wrecked on Holy Island on 19 Oct 1875. He was discharged in London on 19 Oct 1875. Missionary In 1876 he attended the Church Missionary Society College, Islington, and in 1878 led a party of four missionaries to Uganda to replace four who had died. The first party of CMS missionaries, led by Lt. G. Shergold-Smith, had landed at Bagamoyo in July 1876, but a year later two had been killed in a skirmish, and two others had died of fever. Pearson and his companions, Robert William Felkin, John William Hall and the Rev. George Litchfield, travelled by ship to Suakim on the Red Sea. At Suakim, Hall was taken ill and had to return to England. From there, after crossing the desert, the remaining members of the party travelled up the Nile. They met Colonel Gordon in Khartoum, who tried to persuade Pearson to serve in Sudan instead. Pearson and his party reached Rubaga in Uganda on 14 February 1879, over nine months after setting out. They were received at the court of Mutesa I, the Kabaka (King) of Buganda. A week later a party of French Roman Catholic missionaries arrived, and difficulties ensued as Mutesa played off Arab, British and French interests against each other. The Christian missionaries had, perhaps rather naively, not come prepared to be used as political pawns. Their denominational rivalry reduced the effectiveness of their message, as the Catholics refused to kneel for the Anglican prayers and vice versa. Pearson appears to have been mainly occupied in translation work. After serving in Uganda for two years Pearson returned to England for health reasons, using the more conventional route via the East Coast and Zanzibar. Ordination He then studied theology at Oxford, and was ordained deacon in 1886 and priest in 1887. He was assistant curate at St Ebbe's in Oxford for four years, and then worked for the Church Pastoral Aid Society (CPAS) in Nottingham for another three years. In July 1893 he became Vicar of Walton, Aylesbury, where he remained until his death on 1917-06-20. He was known as a student of languages, and gained knowledge of 17 languages. He was eminent as a translator, and served several publishers and missionary organisations in that capacity. Marriage and children He married Elizabeth Birkett in Oxford in 1882, and they had three sons and four daughters.

The quarry railways had four different track gauges. The standard gauge part had a junction with the main line that passed close to Betchworth station, before reversing to run to the Eastern and Southern Kiln Batteries. A gauge railway system began there and primarily served the quarry with lines diverging to the Main, Upper Western Whitestone and Eastern Greystone Pits. The other gauges serving the works were the gauge line that ran from a standard gauge siding to the Hearthstone Mine, and a short gauge section of track that ran exclusively between the Eastern and Southern Kiln Batteries. The first engine to shunt on the standard gauge portion, Engine No. 1 of 1871, was unofficially named The Coffeepot. It is now preserved at Beamish Museum in County Durham. Another, Captain Baxter was renamed simply Baxter in 1947, the last engine ever to work the line, and the Rev. W.V. Awdry featured it in his book Stepney the \\"Bluebell\\" Engine. Baxter is preserved on the Bluebell Railway and was returned to traffic for that railway's 50th anniversary. Two gauge locomotives were also preserved. Townsend Hook, is at Amberley Chalk Pits Museum, undergoing reconstruction (as of October 2010) to become a static exhibit.

They are generally weaker in explosive power than the fireworks used in professional displays. A typical example of consumer fireworks - rockets, right right punk right right  Examples  Consumer fireworks are often quite small and can be classified into three groups: daytime, nighttime, and novelty fireworks.  Daytime fireworks  Daytime fireworks include most bottle rockets, smoke balls, firecrackers, and other fireworks that emit very little or no light. Some examples of daytime consumer fireworks include: * Skyrocket ‚Äî Launch into the air, sometimes with a high-pitched whistling sound, with a report at the end. Some varieties may emit sparks upon launch. Their sizes can range from an inch to about 6 inches (15 cm) long and 1/8 to 3/4 inches (3‚Äì19 mm) around, not including the stick. The smaller variety of these rockets are also commonly referred to as \\"Bottle Rockets\\" due to the commonality in which people use a bottle as a launching platform. * Firecracker ‚Äî An explosion occurs on the ground, often in a series. They range from 1 to 16,000+ on a single string. * Smoke ball ‚Äî Emits colored smoke for a few seconds. Colors typically include white, green, blue, yellow, orange, fuchsia, red and pink. * Multiple Rocket Launcher ‚Äî More commonly known as the \\"Saturn Missile Battery\\" typically launches a series of 16 to 800 small rockets (dependent on the firework purchased) with a high-pitched whistle each time, often with a report. * Snake - a firework that, when lit, leaves a trail of ash.  Novelty fireworks  Novelty fireworks typically produce a much weaker explosion and sound. In some countries and areas where fireworks are illegal to use, they still allow these small, low grade fireworks to be used. A few examples include: * Party Poppers ‚Äî once a string is pulled to activate the charge, confetti is thrust into the air and produces a report. * Snaps ‚Äî a small paper bag typically filled with gravel and a few micrograms of silver fulminate will produce a report when thrown at a hard surface or stepped on. * Flying Lanterns (Sky lantern) ‚Äî these paper lanterns float into the sky when lit. They emit a slight glow and are very commonly used at weddings and celebrations. * Paper Tanks & Vehicles ‚Äî when lit, these small paper vehicles emit sparks that cause them to move around on the ground and commonly produce a loud bang at the end. * Party Bombs ‚Äî a tube filled with toys which, when lit, shoots the toys into the air distributing them around the room. Used in Switzerland (tischbombes). * Ground Bloom Flowers ‚Äî a small cylinder that spins on the ground and changes color, spinning in such a way that it resembles a flower. Could be described as a large Jumping Jack. * Snakes (Black snake) ‚Äî a small compressed pellet that, when lit, expands into a long snake-like object. Use Tools Consumer fireworks can be used with a variety of tools. One set of tools has to do with basic ignition, such as lighters, matches, and punks also known as a 'port fire'. By using a rack, one can ignite a series of different fireworks to create a scene. These sometimes allow for the finales seen at professional fireworks displays to be created using consumer fireworks. Racks can be used with multiple types of fireworks, such as aerial shells, fountains, Roman candles, and the newest class of fireworks, 500 gram repeaters. Other tools are involved with the setup of fireworks for later display, such as shovels, various hand tools, and spare visco fuses. The true scope of tools used with consumer fireworks is limited only by the displayer's imagination. Lighting and launching There are several ways by which fireworks can be ignited. The most basic of these is simply flame from a match, lighter or other devices that emits flames. Another way to light fireworks is by using a device called a punk. A punk is a long, thin piece of wood covered in a substance that burns very slowly, producing only heat, with no flame. A port fire is a smoldering compound as a powder compressed in a stiff paper tube. The most complicated method used to ignite consumer fireworks is to use electronic ignition. This is the preferred method of many professional pyrotechnicians worldwide because of the vast improvement in operator safety. There are a few electronic ignition (often called \\"e-fire\\") systems that use readily available materials. Regulations Laws regarding consumer fireworks vary between countries and states. Asia In Asia, fireworks are commonly displayed during Lunar New Year. Traditionally, firecrackers were used to scare off evil spirits. =India= In India, fireworks are primarily sold and lit during the Hindu festival of Diwali. Due to the increasing levels of Air pollution in Delhi and the greater National Capital Region , the sale of fireworks were banned in the city by the Supreme Court during Diwali in 2017. Europe Fireworks on New Year's Eve 2004‚Äì2005 in the UK. =Belgium= In Belgium, fireworks (except category 1) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. Fireworks are available for purchase year round, but may only be used by police permission. =Finland= In Finland, fireworks (other than novelties and sparklers) are usually sold between Christmas and New Years. It is legal to sell fireworks all year round (predominantly through online retailers). They may only be used on New Year's Eve from 6 pm to 2 am the following morning. =Germany= In Germany, fireworks are available for purchase from many stores in the 3 days prior to New Year's Eve, allowing families to have their own celebrations in their backyard. =Iceland= In Iceland, fireworks are sold from December 28‚Äì31 and again on January 6. =Ireland= In Ireland, the import of consumer fireworks is strictly controlled, and the use of them must be overseen by a professional fireworks operator. This has led to considerable smuggling of fireworks from Northern Ireland, where regulations governing the sale of fireworks are more permissive. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, fireworks (other than category 1) cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 16. They are only sold the last three days up until and including December 31. If one of those days is a Sunday, the sale period is moved to the 28 up until and including December 30. Fireworks may only be fired between 6 pm on New Year's Eve to 2 am the following day. =Norway= In Norway, fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18.

Fireworks are available for purchase year round but are primarily sold before New Year's Eve. In urban areas they may only be fired new years eve, eastern eve and Walpurgis Night without a police permission. There may be time regulations on these days as well, but it depends on what municipality you are in. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18 and are not permitted to be set off between 11 pm and 7 am. Exceptions are made for New Year, Bonfire Night (5 November), the Chinese New Year and Diwali.Statutory Instrument 2004 No. 1836 The Fireworks Regulations 2004, United Kingdom.

It is legal in Canada to purchase a wide variety of consumer fireworks, such as Roman candles and star wheels, however all products offered for sale must be tested and approved by the ERD. Regulations regarding the dates when fireworks may be purchased, venues for operating fireworks, and other restrictions are set by the individual provinces and territories, and may vary widely from province to province or even between municipalities within the same province. *Alberta: With recent changes to the Alberta Fire Code, the province now allows each municipality to regulate the sale and use of consumer fireworks. In Wood Buffalo, there is a total ban, meaning fireworks cannot be purchased or set off anywhere, while Edmonton allows fireworks, but only upon obtaining a permit first. *British Columbia: In Metro Vancouver, fireworks can be bought in Vancouver, Burnaby, West Vancouver and North Vancouver, as long as it is within a week of Halloween (and with a permit), but they cannot be purchased in Surrey, Richmond, Langley, and Abbotsford, and much of the lower mainland. *Ontario: Fireworks may be purchased in the two weeks preceding Canada Day and Victoria Day without a permit, and (barring local prohibitions) may be set off on the three days surrounding each holiday without a permit. Some GTA municipalities have allowed fireworks on the Hindu festival of Diwali. *Quebec: St. Jean-Baptiste Day is a major fireworks celebration, however the focus is generally on display fireworks as opposed to consumer. Fireworks are prohibited year-round on the Island of Montreal, though allowed in much of the rest of the province. *Atlantic Canada:fireworks are legal and can be used all year round. =United States= In the United States, the laws governing consumer fireworks vary widely from state to state, or from county to county. It is common for consumers to cross state and county lines in order to purchase types of fireworks which are outlawed in their home jurisdictions. Fireworks laws in urban areas typically limit sales or use by dates or seasons. Municipalities may have stricter laws than their counties or states do. The Consumer Product Safety Commission defines what fireworks may be considered consumer fireworks. Consumer fireworks in the United States are limited to 500 grams (this was previously 350 grams until about 12 years ago) of composition for pre-fused multi shot aerials known as cakes, and firecrackers may have up to 50 milligrams of flash powder. Reloadable shells are limited to 1.75\\" in diameter and can have a max of 60 grams of composition, and shells in pre- fused tubes are limited to 2.25\\" and are also limited to 60 grams of composition. Any fireworks that exceed these limits are not considered consumer fireworks and need an ATF license. The American Pyrotechnics Association maintains a directory of state laws pertaining to fireworks. One state ‚Äî Massachusetts ‚Äî bans the sale and use of all consumer fireworks, including novelties and sparklers. Two states ‚Äî Illinois and Vermont ‚Äî permit the sale and use of only wire or wood stick sparklers and other novelties. The following states allow the sale and use of non-aerial and non-explosive fireworks (also called \\"safe and sane\\") like novelties, fountains and sparklers, etc.: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Idaho, Maryland (except for some counties such as Montgomery County which only allows snap-and-pop noise makers, snakes, and party poppers), Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Delaware Governor John Carney signed into law a bill on May 20, 2018, allowing sparklers and non-explosive, non-airborne novelty items. The use is allowed only on July 4 and December 31 each year with sales limited to the 30 days preceding their allowed use. A fireworks stand in Oregon New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law a bill on November 21, 2014 allowing sparklers, party poppers, cone fountains and other novelty items to be sold, possessed, and used in the state of New York outside of New York City. Local governments must approve the sale and use of fireworks before people can legally use them. Although the use of fireworks is allowed year- round, the sale of fireworks, by registered businesses, is limited to a period of June 1 through July 5 and December 26 through January 2 each year. Michigan legislators have passed and enrolled a bill that was signed by Governor Rick Snyder on December 13, 2011 allowing the sale and use of all consumer fireworks, however, sellers must pay a fee ($600‚Äì1000) to sell higher-power consumer fireworks, and a tax will be added to fireworks purchases. California has very specific requirements for the types of consumer fireworks that can be sold to and used by residents. Even then each city can and often does place restrictions on sale and use. In Minnesota only consumer fireworks that do not explode or fly through the air are permitted to be sold to and used by residents. The following states permit the sale of all or most types of consumer fireworks to residents: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia. Many of these states have selling seasons around the 4th of July and/or Christmas and New Year's Eve; Utah also allows the sale and use of fireworks around Pioneer Day, July 24, celebrating the arrival of Mormon settlers to the valley of the Great Salt Lake in 1847. Some of these states also allow local laws or regulations to further restrict the types permitted or the selling seasons. In Florida all consumer fireworks are legal as of (April 8, 2020) and are only permitted on the 4th of July, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day although they can be sold to residents year- round. Each county is allowed to put forward their own regulations. Prior to the passage of this new law, all consumer fireworks could be purchased but buyers had to sign a form declaring intent to use the fireworks for agricultural purposes to scare birds away from crops. The new law https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2020/140 also disallows HOAs from banning fireworks inside communities if the county permits usage. Washington allows consumer fireworks except firecrackers, sky rockets, missiles, and bottle rockets. Each county and city may regulate the use and possession of fireworks. Missouri permits all types of consumer fireworks to be sold to residents with two selling seasons; June 20 ‚Äì July 10 and December 20 ‚Äì January 2. South Carolina permits all types of consumer fireworks except small rockets less than ¬Ω‚Äù in diameter and 3‚Äù long to be sold and used by residents year round. Three states ‚Äî Hawaii, Nevada, and Wyoming ‚Äî allow each county to establish its own regulations. For example, in Nevada, Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, allows residents to purchase and use only non-explosive and non-aerial consumer (safe and sane) fireworks during the 4th of July. Nye County allows persons 18 years of age or older to purchase and use safe and sane and all consumer fireworks on private property or at free designated launch pads. Aerial and explosive consumer fireworks are allowed, but only at designated areas at designated times and dates and only with a permit. Elko County allows the use of sparklers only. Most other counties in Nevada prohibit all types of consumer fireworks. These counties include Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Lincoln, Lyon, Mineral, Pershing, Storey, Washoe, and White Pine. In Maine, fireworks can only be sold to people over 21 at firework only stores except for sparklers that can be sold at stores that sell other items except for propane dealers or other explosives Many states have stores with all types of consumer fireworks that sell to non-residents with the provision they are to remove the purchased fireworks from that state. This is why there are many stores selling fireworks in states like Ohio, Missouri, New Hampshire, Nevada and Wisconsin with all types of consumer fireworks, even though residents are limited or prohibited from buying or using those very same consumer fireworks unless they have the appropriate licenses and/or permits. Many Native American Tribes have consumer fireworks stores on reservation lands that are exempt from state and local authority and will sell to people that are not in the tribe. Oceania =Australia= In Australia, most states outlaw fireworks. They are only allowed to be sold and used on the 1st of July, one day a year in the NT, with restrictions on what time they can be used. NT regulates what fireworks cakes and novelties can be sold to the public. Tasmania also allows citizens to apply for a permit to use fireworks in certain circumstances. Fireworks are banned everywhere else. Small firecrackers were legal in the ACT on the queens birthday long weekend for ACT residents but were banned in 2009 due to safety concerns. However, small novelties such as party poppers and sparklers are legal in all states. =New Zealand= In New Zealand fireworks cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18 (previously 14), and may only be sold for the four days leading up to and including November 5. However, fireworks are able to be used at any time of the year (i.e.: there is no time restriction on when fireworks can be used, even though there is a restriction on the sales time of fireworks). The types of fireworks available to the public are multi- shot \\"cakes\\", Roman candles, single shot shooters, ground and wall spinners, fountains, cones, sparklers, and various novelties, such as smoke bombs and pharaoh's serpents. sales of fireworks have become increasingly restricted in recent years. Skyrockets, and other fireworks where the firework itself flies were banned in 1994. Firecrackers and Bangers were banned in 1993. As of 2007, sparklers may only be purchased no more than 50 at a time in packs with other fireworks. This is due to the popularity of sparkler bombs. Guy Fawkes 2007 FAQ , New Zealand South America =Argentina= In Argentina fireworks were prohibited from public shows in 2019 by a national decree based in article 14 of national constitution and demands of organizations of animal protection and Autism parents. Otherwise most fireworks are completely legal to sell all year round =Chile= In Chile fireworks are restricted for consumer use and can only be seen in professional shows. The prohibition came at the request of organizations dealing with burnt children, many of the accidents being caused by unsupervised use of fireworks. =Colombia= In Colombia any sale of pyrotechnic items or fireworks and balloons is prohibited. Colombian legislation totally prohibits fireworks containing white phosphorus. Violators will receive a fine that can reach US$2,500.

Most student unions were amateur. Leeds was different.\\"Andy Kershaw: The band played there because the students were very professional in The Independent Wednesday 7 June 2006 Kershaw continued, \\"It's extraordinary.

Main prosecution witness prosecution fail to disclose is a drug dealer on witness protection programme. Paul Foot of Private Eye championed case which went to Court of Appeal.[Keep Off The Grass in Private Eye No.836 31/12/93 p26] This was a case involving a former escort agency manageress, Donna Cannon. Cannon was charged with blackmailing one of the agency's clients, James Lawson. Lawson and a friend had sex with an agency girl who told him he did not need to pay the agency fee of ¬£30. Cannon, he said, threatened to accuse him of rape unless he handed over the money. Cannon said that Lawson had sex on different occasions with two girls from the agency who complained to the police. She said she wanted to stop Lawson making any further approaches to the agency and that was why she threatened Lawson with a rape allegation. The prosecutions case rested on Lawson's credibility. He agreed with Cannon's defence barrister, Hind that he had several previous convictions, including dishonesty, forgery and actual bodily harm. Lawson accused the defence counsel, Hind, of trying to blacken his character and repeatedly insisted that he had not been in any trouble for 12 years. The jury at the trial found Cannon guilty of blackmail and sentenced her to 150 hours community service. What made the trial memorable was that Lawson admitted in evidence that his real name was Peter McNeil but refused to answer any questions about his change of name. It emerged after the trial that he had appeared in the witness box at the Old Bailey as a Police Informer giving evidence for the prosecution against 3 Mafia drug smugglers who were members of a gang of which he was part to gain immunity from prosecution. McNeill who had played a big role in the drug smuggling got off without charge in return for giving evidence. The key question is whether the jury in the Cannon trial would have thought differently of Lawson's evidence if they had known of his involvement in the previous trial? Would his involvement with the police as an informer have painted him in a different light at the trial. Hind certainly thought so asking why the defence did not know about Lawson's defence role in the witness box? The explanation offered was an \\"ex parte\\" application made by the Crown Prosecution Service to the judge before the trial asking and getting permission not to disclose certain information. The case for non-disclosure was based on public interest. It was argued by Hind yjat the public interest should not be an excuse for non-disclosing vital information in a criminal case in which the defendants liberty is at stake. = Regina Versus Anthony Ian Jackson = R V Anthony Ian Jackson Preston Crown Court 2005 Drug Supply by proprietor of All Night Club Monroes Acquitted in 8 minutes by Jury of all charges following a 40-day trial.A nightclub owner accused of allowing drugs to be supplied on his premises has denied he knew what was going on.

Jackson went on to explain: \\"There were no drugs to be allowed into the premises.

They were all employees of CAW Ltd of Barrow-in-Furness, which ran seven Cumbria county council civic amenity sites. The firm had originally been paid a set fee for processing the waste. But in 2002 the council introduced a new scheme, in which the firm was paid according to how much waste it handled. This allowed the three to oversee a scam in which the amount of waste processed was exaggerated, with false paperwork being drawn up to back up the bogus figures, so they could claim more money than they should have. In many cases records showed that lorries had contained much more waste than they really had; loads were given \\"multiple tickets\\" (making it look as if several lorries had arrived, not just one) and in some cases records were submitted for loads that hadn't existed at all.

The money had been sprayed with a purple dye, mixed with a unique DNA marker when members of his gang robbed and shot a Loomis security guard weeks earlier. This is the trial of the gang had been involved in robberies of security guards making deliveries to cash machines. The first was outside Morrisons supermarket in Thornton, Lancashire, in August 2008, where they got away with ¬£50,000. The second was at a cash machine in Preston New Road, Blackburn, where a security guard was shot, in December 2008. A gang which included Evans watched two security guards prepare to re-fill a cash machine in Preston Old Road, Blackburn. Hiding their faces behind balaclavas, they pounced running at the guard, Imran Aslam, and demanded he hand over cash. He did. Then he was shot in the leg because they were demanding he opened the door to the estate agents to get more cash. Police stated he couldn't do that. As a result of their frustration they shot him. The attack had triggered the dye and DNA to leak into the cash box covering ¬£20,000 in notes. Some of the stolen notes were discovered by alert staff at a Shell petrol station in Accrington who noticed they had started to get stained notes. The notes were sent to Applied DNA Sciences, the company which provides the DNA and dye to Loomis. Laboratory testing proved the notes had been in the cash box taken in the armed robbery. Two boys, aged 10 and 12, found a loaded firearm while they were playing in a wooded area near Ewood Park in Blackburn.

Court of Appeal call for investigation.A hen party guest who bludgeoned a mother with a bottle after berating her for having an interracial relationship Fashion shop supervisor Emma Mitchell, 30, assaulted Chantelle Phillips Miss Phillips, who had a daughter with an Asian man, suffered serious cuts and had to have 13 stitches. The victim suffered a one-and-a-half-inch wound over her left eye, which needed two internal stitches and nine external stitches, a smaller cut to her head which needed two stitches and extensive swelling and bruising around her left eye. The prosecutor said Miss Phillips had been left scarred and was at a loss to understand why she was attacked as she felt certain she had done nothing wrong. Mitchell denied wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. In mitigation defence counsel Hind said Mitchell had suffered from post-natal depression after having each of her children and had taken anti-depressants. The hen party was her first night out since the birth of her third child. He claimed Mitchell had suffered years of abuse at the hands of her then partner of eight years and had been a 'cowed little woman' in the past. Mr Hind said Mitchell's children might have to go into care if she was sent to prison as she was their sole carer. He continued: 'She tells me she no longer goes out. She is looking after her children. She has changed her life. She has got rid of her partner.\\" Mitchell was convicted of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm at Preston Crown Court and jailed for four and a half years. Judges ordered a probe into the trial amidst claims she had 22 mutual Facebook friends with a member of the jury. The case was controversial because it raised question marks over the impartiality of trial by jury amidst increased social media use. Mitchell argued a series of small town links to the juror means she did not receive a fair trial. The inquiry which was thought to be the first of its kind in the country was ordered by judges at the High Court.Appeal Court. Judges took the rare step of ordering an investigation by independent watchdog, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), into what the juror had known about Mitchell at the time of her trial. Mitchell's barrister, Hind, said evidence had surfaced that the juror had written about her court duty on Facebook and had ‚Äòliked‚Äô a comment by a friend, which stated: \\"If it was me I would send them all down.\\" The trial judge had refused to discharge the juror after she admitted knowing the landlady of the Farthings pub, in Blackburn, where Mitchell first confronted the victim of her attack, he added. It later emerged that the landlady had managed another pub where Mitchell had committed previous criminal damage and violent disorder offences, the court in London heard. Hind said that, as well as the Facebook connection, it had also come out that the juror's daughter saw Mitchell arrested for the wounding offence and was friends with a member of Mitchell's family. Witness statements claimed the juror had previously drunk at the same pub and once lived near Mitchell. \\"Blackburn is not the smallest town, but it is not the biggest,\\" Hind added. \\"There was a very real danger the juror could have been biased.\\"Usually jurors cannot be questioned on why they reached a verdict or what took place in their deliberations during a trial. The appeal judge, sitting with Lord Justice Pitchford and Judge Francis Gilbert QC, directed the CCRC to quiz the juror on what she knew about Mitchell and to establish if there was any risk of bias. The judge added: \\"In the circumstances we have decided to adjourn the appeal and we also believe that it is appropriate in this case that the matter be referred to the CCRC in order that they should be able to carry out an investigation.\\"Top judges order inquiry into 'Facebook link' of defendant and juror in Lancashire Telegraph 28 December 2012 = Regina Versus Simmon Grayson= R V Simmon Grayson 2014 -.

Jail sentence for ‚Äòbrutal‚Äô rape in Lytham & St. Anne's Express Friday 20 June 2014 = Regina Versus Mary Kidson = R V Mary Kidson 2014 Worcester Crown Court -defendant accused poisoning her child by allegedly administering illegally obtained prescriptive drugs to her daughter who was removed from her care by social services. Defendant was acquitted by direction of Judge at end of prosecution. Lancashire Barrister Hind and Blackburn Solicitors Simon Farnsworth, Deborah Morgan of FMB took on the case of Mary Kidson a local woman from Nelson, who had moved to live in Herefordshire and secured her acquittal in a landmark case that could have long term impacts on suffers from thyroid and cortisol hormone deficiencies throughout the NHS. Mary Kidson's daughter suffered with a number of physical problems, primarily she was constantly fatigued, had low blood pressure, lack of energy, pain in muscles and joints plus other problems. She was seen by 5 endocrine paediatric consultants in the NHS ‚Äì 4 of whom discharged her saying there was nothing wrong with her as it was all in the mind. Mary did not believe this, she researched on the internet, read books on hormone deficiency and accessed the web sites of Thyroid UK and the Thyroid Patients Advocacy Forum. She was convinced her daughter had deficiencies in cortisol, thyroid and oestrogen. Taking advantage of section 13 in the Medicines Act 1968 she ordered hormones from accredited pharmacies on the internet. She consulted Dr Durrant Peatfield an unregistered physician who had been criticised by the GMC for his views expressed in his book on the Thyroid Gland who approved her treatments. She was still concerned to have a registered physician directing her daughter's treatment and was recommended to Dr Thierry Hertoghe, the President of the International Hormone Society with 3000 physician members worldwide. Dr Hertoghe has written 7 books including the Hormone Manual, one of the leading text books for physicians practising abroad in this field. Hind said Thierry Hertoghe was highly respected, had written a number of books and addressed international conferences.Mary Kidson trial: Jury hears daughter did not need any of the medication given in Hereford Times 15 October 2014 Mary took her daughter to Brussels where Dr Hertoghe carried out tests on 40 hormones and minerals, far more than carried out by the NHS and diagnosed chronic fatigue syndrome caused by hormone deficiencies. He prescribed hormones and nutrients and treated her for 5 months. On 5 March 2013 without having spoken to Mary, social workers and police officers turned up at her home & arrested her, took her daughter into interim care where she was placed with foster carers whom she did not know her for 2 months. Doctors examined Mary's daughter who they said had nothing wrong with her, made no contact with Dr Hertoghe to ask about diagnosis and treatments, despite the fact he wrote to the police, doctors in the case and social services 3 times. NHS doctors ended all the hormone treatments. Mary's daughter was interviewed on videotape by the police and said she felt better as a consequence of the treatments. 9 months later in January 2014, the police charged Mary Kidson with poisoning her daughter unlawfully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm or endangering her life. Mary was only able to see her daughter for 2 hours a fortnight and that was under the supervision of a social worker until April 2014. In breach of her bail conditions Mary was phoning and texting her daughter in response to requests for help and reassurance. Mary was remanded in custody to prison for 6 months for a breach of this bail condition, her daughter was certified under the Mental Health Act and sent to a psychiatric hospital where she remains. The case came to Worcester Crown Court for trial for 3 weeks. Deborah Morgan who prepared the case for trial commented \\"One of our first requirements was to speak to Mary‚Äòs 16 year old daughter as the prosecution declined to call her but Hereford Social Services blocked it at every turn. Eventually a psychiatrist appointed by the defence was allowed into the hospital to speak to her, he found she was fit to give evidence and wanted to do so on behalf of her mother as she was within 2 weeks of being discharged by her psychiatrist. I turned up at the hospital to see her and was told I could not do so because Herefordshire Social Services blocked it. Eventually I was allowed in after application to the trial Judge which Herefordshire Social Services fiercely resisted in court.\\" Hind stated ‚Äò‚ÄôMary Kidson‚Äôs defence was that as a loving caring mother who had struggled for years with her daughter‚Äôs ill health she only wanted to see her get well, develop normally and have a happy, fulfilled adult life. After 11 days in court, evidence from 5 consultants, 2 social workers, a forensic scientist and police officers, the Judge directed the jury to acquit Mary Kidson as there was no evidence of grievous bodily harm (accepted by the prosecution) and that the alleged victim‚Äôs life had not been endangered.\\" Hind, said Mrs Kidson's daughter suffered with a number of health problems including fatigue, muscle pain and low blood pressure. He said that the 'landmark ruling' could now have a long-term impact on sufferers of thyroid and cortisol hormone deficiencies seeking treatment who felt they were struggling to get the right treatment from their doctors. Hind said: \\"We were initially approached by her family to take this case and we undertook it as this was the kind of case which we came into this profession to deal with and protect the man and woman in the street where we see the state has got things wrong.\\" \\"Her defence was that as a loving caring mother who had struggled for years with her daughter‚Äôs ill health she only wanted to see her get well, develop normally and have a happy, fulfilled adult life.\\"East Lancs woman cleared of poisoning teenage daughter with unnecessary medication In Lancashire Telegraph 11 November 2014 At the centre of the case was the treatment of NHS doctors for thyroid hormone deficiency. Dr Hertoghe from Brussels who gave evidence described the NHS as 40 years behind in this area of treatment. He commented that the NHS only treats patients when they are 70% hormone deficient, where he and his colleagues treat when the patient is 25-30% deficient. Judge Robert Juckes QC told the jury there was no evidence that grievous bodily harm had been caused or that there was a risk to the girl's life. During the conduct of the case Hind's Team discovered that this is not an isolated tragedy which are mainly dealt with in Family Courts where anxious parents have been threatened with removal of their children into care. Mary Kidson said questions need to be asked about the 'monopoly' the NHS has on child medical care. Sue Hind, practice manager at Ms Kidson's defence team Newtom Chambers, called it a \\"David and Goliath\\" case. She said: \\"It was a privilege to be part of Mary Kidson‚Äôs tiny defence team in the face of Hereford police and social services. Mary showed great dignity and stoicism throughout the trial but was passionate about the world understanding she wanted only the best for her daughter. It was a bit like David fighting Goliath so thank goodness sense prevailed.\\"Mother cleared of poisoning teenager daughter with hormones supplied by Belgian doctor says case should be landmark for parents' rights in The Independent Thursday 30 October 2014 Hind said [Ms Kidson] had been left \\"shell-shocked\\" by her time in custody and was \\"coming to terms with normality\\".Ledbury daughter-poisoning accused cleared on orders of judge in BBC News 30 October 2014 = Regina Versus Rebecca Tootle = R V Rebecca Tootle; 2014 -Preston Crown Court charged with murder issue was the right of a defendant attacked at her own home to use force. Acquitted of murder convicted of manslaughter. Ashley Meadowcroft was 18 when stabbed to death by Rebecca Tootle who was addicted to the synthetic drug, Happy Hooker. Tootle said the drugs made her calmer. But when Mr Meadowcroft turned up at her house with a \\"dangerous\\" dog, demanding to speak to her boyfriend, she plunged a knife into his chest. He suffered a fatal knife wound to his lung and died in hospital 45 minutes later despite efforts to save him. Her barrister, Hind, told Preston Crown Court: \\"While she has been in custody, she has addressed a lot of problems. She has been free from these legal highs ‚Äîmembers of the public do not seem to appreciate how much damage it does to them.\\" Tootle, 20, told police Mr Meadowcroft had brought the knife to her house and even scratched her arm before they arrived to make her story more viable. But despite making legal history by being the first defendant to argue under the new defence of 'disproportionate force' she was found guilty of manslaughter at Preston Crown Court. Police were called to Tootle's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, on 4 September last 2014. She claimed she had 'loads of trouble' with the teenager and told police he had stalked her, robbed her and tried to rape her. As officers arrested Mr Meadowcroft she told them: 'He's a f***ing d***, he's stabbed me so I took the knife off him and stabbed him self-defence. 'He could have killed me. He could have definitely killed my fianc√©. He broke into my address. I didn't do it on purpose.' In a 999 call after the stabbing she told operators that Mr Meadowcroft had a dangerous dog and could be heard screaming: 'Help me, help me, I've been stabbed.' Mr Reid said: 'When police got there she showed a small mark on one of her arms and was saying: \\"I had to take the knife off him because he's mental\\". 'But Mr Meadowcroft never had a knife, he did not try to stab the defendant and he caused her no injury to her arm. 'The defendant was lying about all these matters within a short time of her having plunged the knife into Mr Meadowcroft's chest.' He added that Tootle consciously armed herself with the knife before she went to answer the door. She discarded the weapon in her garden after the attack. He said: 'The idea that a few marks on her would justify her in killing someone who had come into her house was not something that had just occurred to her that night.' Police described Tootle as a 'violent individual' who had previously dialled 999 on a number of occasions to falsely claim someone was in her house with a knife. Detective Inspector Andy Cribbin, from Lancashire Police, said: 'Tootle took it upon herself to attack Ashley and then fabricate an account portraying herself as the victim. 'She armed herself with a knife, attacked him and then set about trying to justify what she did and never took any responsibility for her actions.' Prior to the attack she falsely claimed Ashley had a knife and immediately afterwards she said that she had disarmed him and then used the knife to inflict a minor injury upon herself in an attempt to defend her actions. Judge Tim Holroyde told Tootle she was 'sly and manipulative' and posed a 'danger' to the public. He said: 'Having observed you throughout the trial there can in my judgement be no doubt whatsoever that you are dangerous. By your act, although you did not intend it, you ended a young life.' The trial was the first in Britain where the defence of 'disproportionate force' was put forward under an amendment the Crime and Courts Act 2013. The new law means that if somebody is acting in an 'extreme circumstance' such as a burglary, they can use 'necessary' force to stop the offender. Tootle, 20, of Fecitt Brow, was found guilty of manslaughter and was sentenced to nine years in prison, which will be followed by a further five years on licence \\"to protect the public\\".Blackburn stabbing: Rebecca Tootle jailed for killing friend in BBC News 23 February 2015 = Regina Versus Abid Khan = R V Abid Khan 2015-16 ‚Äì Manchester Crown Court - Rochdale Grooming Case charged along with a number of other men with sexual assault and rape upon vulnerable girls under the age of 16. Abid Khan, 38, of Liverpool, was found guilty of sexual activity with a child. The principal complainant in the case, who was raped by six of the men, walked into a police station in 2012 claiming to know about the \\"Rochdale grooming case\\", following widespread media coverage of the convictions of a number of Asian men for grooming white girls for sex. The victim reported that when she was aged 14 and 15 she was herself repeatedly sexually groomed by a large number of men from the Rochdale area.

In his maiden speech Hind stated, \\"I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this most important debate. Lancashire, West was created out of three former constituencies‚ÄîCrosby, Ince and the old constituency of Ormskirk. I pay tribute to my predecessors for their hard work and their diligence in representing the people whom I now represent. I am proud to be here, and those Conservatives who come from Ormskirk and its surrounding villages take the view that for a number of years the area was merely loaned to the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) while the largely Labour-voting constituents of Kirby sustained him and overcame the great support in Ormskirk for the Conservative party. West Lancashire is a microcosm of the country and highlights some of the problems of regional policy. An economy is strong if it contains a vital small business sector. Each of the three strongest economies in the Western world‚ÄîWest Germany, the United States and Japan‚Äî have much larger small business sectors than Britain. Therefore, we should follow their initiatives to create similar conditions. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) to say that we can raise money by returning to full employment, but he failed to point out how to achieve this and how rapidly it is possible to move from our present level of unemployment to full employment. I am sure that this is the question to which each hon. Member would like an answer as soon as possible. We are dealing with the present, not the possibly idyllic conditions of the future. The old town of Ormskirk typifies what is happening. My constituency is divided into the towns of Ormskirk and Skelmersdale, which are generations apart. Ormskirk is an old market town situated in one of the largest belts of grade A farm land and surrounded by about 30 villages. It is a relatively prosperous area with a number of good shopping centres, and unemployment is 8 per cent. In the Ormskirk region the number of small businesses is far greater than in Skelmersdale, which is 20 years old and has an unemployment rate of 31¬∑5 per cent. ‚Äî 15,000 of a population of 43,000 are unemployed. We do not have to look far for the reason. When Skelmersdale began, all the eggs were put in one basket. In 1974, during \\"the white heat of technology,\\" the party of the hon. Member for Dagenham set up factories in Skelmersdale. We have seen the demise of two of them. The first to go was Courtaulds, when the bottom fell out of the man-made fibre industry and the factory went to the wall. Then, as a result of many problems, many of them related to union trouble, the Thorn EMI manufacture of television tubes also disappeared. Those two factories and a third, Dunlop, made many people redundant and caused an increase of 5,000 in unemployment in the mid-1970s. That was long before the recession, as we know it, began to bite. Skelmersdale desperately needs new small businesses and gradually, slowly but surely, things have begun to improve. I have heard that Skelmersdale does not enjoy the best reputation in the House but I believe that that is unjustified, because the town is settling down. More houses in Skelmersdale, built by the development corporation, have been sold than in any other authority area in the north-west. The figure is over 2,000, which represents 20 per cent. of the housing stock. Private builders are building fast. Small factories employing more people are growing gradually. Perhaps the most significant pointer to the settling down of a new town is the fact that there is a low crime level. Our major crime is teenage burglary. Skelmersdale has motorway connections north, south, east and west. The port of Liverpool is nearby. In addition, there are two airports within forty minutes' travelling time. I am as proud to represent the people of Skelmersdale as they are to be part of that town. I must point out to the hon. Member for Dagenham who started the movement in favour of a small business policy that between 1974 and 1979 his party was in power but it did nothing of any consequence for small businesses. It was not until the Conservatives came to power in 1979 that the country became aware of the importance of the small business sector. I point out to my hon. Friend the Minister the problems that some new town businesses have. I echo the statements that have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Mrs. Winterton) about the burden of paper work on small businesses, and the fact that rates, which we seem to forget, are an overhead that reduces employment. Problems are also caused by the Employment Protection Act. I ask the Minister to study all these matters carefully to see what help can be given to small businesses. I should like the Minister to consider particularly one aspect of the business allowance scheme. It is a successful scheme and a number of my constituents have applied to join it. They have borrowed ¬£1,000, and they have registered for the necessary length of time, but they have found that, because their wives are in employment, they are not entitled to claim the weekly allowance permitted under the scheme. I ask the Minister to consider that matter, as we are losing initiatives and potential businesses. I also ask the Minister to consider small businesses' planning problems. When one starts from nothing, it is easier to operate from an upstairs room or a garage. Perhaps the Minister could relax planning legislation so that, providing small businesses do not cause noise or smell, or create traffic, they can in the short term operate in dwelling houses. The people who have signed on the scheme could benefit from that. I welcome my hon. Friend's enterprise agencies scheme. I hope that there will be one in Skelmersdale and Ormskirk. I shall do everything possible, as will hon. Members in their areas, to develop the enterprise agency in my area. I echo what was said about the banks. Perhaps we could give the clearing banks a bit of a shake-up. They are too cautious. It has been said that many of them are merely moneylenders rather than bankers. We should urge them to be more like venture organisations and to consider how they can benefit their clients and assist them to expand. It is sad that the role that they should perform, which is performed in Germany, Japan and America, is being fulfilled by the British Technology Group and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister not to allow the investment function of BTG to be removed or eroded. In my area, a specialist development area with difficulties, BTG has played an important role, which has benefited the community a great deal. I hope that it continues in that role. As long as the banks fail in their duty to industry and small businesses, it will be necessary to have organisations such as BTG to fill the gap. I ask my hon. Friend to consider the problems faced by the expanding small business in a new town. New town development corporations are tied to producing a specific return on their assets. It is difficult for the business to move from one factory to another. It is all right if the factory is owned by the development corporation, but many are being sold to the private sector, which is a sign that the town is maturing and becoming a greater part of our economy. I ask my hon. Friend to consider allowing some of those companies relief from 17 and 20-year leases so that they can move to other factories to expand. The burden should be put on the development corporations to lease those factories as best they can. In old industrial areas, old factories can be broken down into smaller units and can provide cheap accommodation for industries that are starting up. The workshop scheme has operated in such premises. In a new town such as Skelmersdale we do not have such property; they have to be built and are expensive to rent. I ask the Minister to consider that problem. The people who are taking advantage of the business allowance scheme in the new towns cannot find the accommodation that is necessary to carry out a manufacturing function. I hope that I speak for those hon. Members who represent the new towns when I say that I welcome the fact that, when some of the development corporations are wound up, the Commission for the New Towns will monitor and assist in small firm development in the industrial centres of those towns. We must also bear in mind the Infotech centres. We have referred to the service industries but we must not forget that the high-tech industries, be they in the service or manufacturing sphere, are also small businesses which have an important role. It has been suggested that we should remain with the old industries. Britain cannot compete with the Third world in some forms of manufacturing process as our unit costs are too high. We must look to the new technologies. Skelmersdale will be looking towards the new technologies. The Government must assist in every possible way to develop such industries in the new towns. The Government must be congratulated on their programme of 108 various schemes to help small businesses. Criticisms have been made that the schemes are too complicated. I advise the critics to acquire a copy of a document called \\"How to Make your Business Grow.\\" The document is very simple. It tells business men whom to see and where to go for advice. Every small business man should have this document on his desk. For the hon. Member for Dagenham to say that the Government do not tell the small business man where to go for advice is wrong. This document is the answer. Development of the small business sector must never cease. We can never say that we have done enough. Development in that sector is continuing and can be improved. I urge the Government to continue as they have begun. I hope that they will accept some of the remarks which have been made as assisting them in furthering their policy.\\" The Speech was described by his colleague on the Conservative benches, Roger Freeman MP Roger Freeman, Baron Freeman as, \\"an extremely clear and interesting speech. I know that the more senior Members of the House will join me in congratulating my hon. Friend and looking forward to many contributions from him in the future.\\"  Parliamentary Activity  = Society of Conservative Lawyers = In his period in Parliament Hind was Secretary of the Society of Conservative Lawyers Committee and Secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group of MPs. = Appealing Sentences = One of the few occasions Hind rebelled against the Government was over sentencing policy. He believed that sentences handed down by the courts should be able to be appealed if the poosecution on behalf of the victims of crime believed they were too light. In a debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in the House of Commons on 27 November 1986 Hind stated, \\"The question of appeals also causes me some anxiety. I fully support what has been said about the Court of Appeal's role in providing guidelines for sentencing in criminal cases. It has done that particularly well of late, as can be shown in the guidelines for sentences given for supplying drugs and rape. In such cases, two outstanding directives have been given by the Court of Appeal. But we are being asked to support a clause that will give the relative of a murdered man, or a man killed through reckless driving, the opportunity to ask the Attorney- General to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal judges may say that in the circumstances the sentence is wholly wrong and that such and such should have happened. That would leave the relative dissatisfied. Moreover, the tabloid newspapers, in particular, might apply pressure and press for stronger provisions. Perhaps that issue should be reconsidered. We could adopt two courses. First, we could bite the bullet about allowing the prosecution a right of appeal. We have never done that in this country, but that is effectively what we are doing. We could go the whole way, and could allow the prosecution, in cases of leniency, to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal. The other option would be to leave things as they are and avoid the double jeopardy that is often given as a reason for opposing such provisions. However, we have a halfway house. That is bound to lead to pressure for the prosecution to have a right of appeal in cases of leniency. I foresee that it is something that we shall be considering within the next few years. It would not surprise me to find ourselves dealing with such a measure in the years to come.\\"in Hansard Orders of the Day ‚Äî Criminal Justice Bill ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 5:22 pm on 27th November 1986 Hind presaged evolution in the Government's thinking which allowed the Attorney General to Appeal unduly lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal in the Criminal Justice Bill of 1987. In a debate in the House of Commons on Business Questions which took place in the House of Commons on 2 December 1988 he pointed out that, \\" the provision contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1987 that would entitle the Attorney- General to refer that lenient sentence to the Court of Appeal for re- examination\\" had not yet been invoked.in Hansard Business of the House ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 4:10 pm on 1st December 1988. In a debate on Lawlessness which took place in the House of Commons on 10 March 1989 Hind outlined his thoughts on sentencing policy and why he believed sentences for first offences were too lenient and the effect this had on the prison population, He stated, \\"One matter that is of grave concern to me is the issue of sentencing on which we should take a major initiative to attack the problem of lawlessness. In the past few years there has been a growth in our prison population. In 1969 it was 32,400; in 1978 it was 41,800 and today it is 50,000. If we project it forward to the year 2000, it will be 70,000, with the attendant need for more prison places and more prison officers. A major reason for that increase is our ladder system of sentencing offenders. When a young man or a young girl appears before the juvenile court for the first time, he or she will probably be told off, given an absolute or conditional discharge and allowed to go his or her way. On returning on several occasions, such young people receive conditional discharges, supervision orders, care orders and fines. Often they will appear five, six or seven times before a court says, \\"Enough is enough. We must now deprive you of your liberty to stem the tide of your criminal behaviour.\\" However, during that period we have established in the mind of the offender the idea that he or she can get away with what has been done. The offenders develop contempt for our court institutions for the police and for the institutions of law and order generally. We must face that problem sooner or later. I advise my hon. Friend the Minister of State that the way to deal with that problem is to sort out those offenders much earlier. We should not allow offenders to climb the ladder of offending in the way that they have been doing in the past. So many of our non-custodial sentences constitute a minor form of punishment and offenders believe that they are getting away with it. That can only breed contempt. I call for an entirely different approach and I suggest that it will take about 10 years to deal with the problem. If someone is a first offender and the offence is relatively serious, that person should be deprived of his liberty immediately, but for a very short period. Many judges subscribe to my view that often a few days spent in an elderly prison, of which we have many, like Armley, Strangeways, Lincoln or Wandsworth here in London, would be sufficient to deal with the problem. Before that offender becomes used to the regime, he is released. He carries burning in his mind the memory of the unpleasantness of an old Victorian prison. I advocate that for adults who offend for the first time. A similar approach should be taken towards younger people who offend for the first time. We could use old detention centres or youth custody for a short time. If we closed the door of the cell behind the offender for about two weeks that would burn into his mind the knowledge that he will find himself in a similar environment if he appears in court again. The sentence should have two aspects. First, it should act as punishment, for which I have advocated the short sentence. Secondly, there should be rehabilitation and involve many of the good ideas set out in the Green Paper \\"Punishment Custody and the Community\\" produced by my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office. The probation service, social workers and supervision should help the offender through the few months after the end of his sentence and so help him in the community. It is most important that we stop offenders in their tracks early. If we do that, we will build respect for the police and our institutions. However, that will take a long time and it might take 10 years to roll back the contempt which has been built into our society. As a criminal practitioner with years of experience in the law, I know that many of my clients with records have received non-custodial sentences. They have walked away from court and their parting words to me have often been, \\"But I got away with it.\\" To a certain extent, we must rethink the process.\\"in Hansard Lawlessness ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 9:35 am on 10th March 1989  Amendment to the 1987 Criminal Justice Bill Enshrining the Right to Appeal Unduly Lenient Sentences in Law  So strongly did Hind feel about the issue of appealing unduly lenient sentences he believed the principle should be enshrined in law. On 31 March 1987 therefore much to the chagrin of the Government Whips Hind proposed an Amendment to the 1987 Criminal Justice Bill at Second Reading stage. He set out his reasons for introducing a New Clause to replace Clause 29, Amendment No. 60 of the Bill on the floor of the House of Commons. He stated, ‚ÄúThe new clause seeks to impose standards of sentencing upon the courts. It is geared to the guidelines that have been provided consistently by the Court of Appeal and by directions from the Lord Chief Justice, which have been passed on to judges at sentencing conferences. At present, anybody who receives an excessive sentence can appeal to the Court of Appeal to have his sentence reduced so that it conforms with the guidelines. The same opportunity is not afforded to victims of crime when the accused is given a manifestly lenient sentence. Neither the prosecution nor the victim can draw the attention of the Court of Appeal to that lenient sentence and ask for it to be increased. That was made abundantly clear in the Ealing vicarage rape case. The attention of the public was drawn to the leniency of the sentence that was passed on one of the accused. The guidelines were clearly not adhered to in that case, but there was no remedy. The clause extends to the victims of crime the same privilege as is extended to defendants. If a judge continues to give lenient sentences, those sentences cannot be reviewed. New clause 20 deals with that problem. It stresses that the sentence must be manifestly inadequate and that it does not meet the guidelines, before there can be an appeal to the Court of Appeal. For the first time, a more important role is provided for prosecution counsel. Having called upon a police officer to read out the antecedents, counsel will no longer be able to close his brief and say, \\"My part in this case is over.\\" He will be obliged to advise the Crown prosecutor of the adequacy or otherwise of the sentence that has been passed. Some people fear that for the first time the prosecution will be involved in the passing of the sentence. It will not be involved in that process; nor will it have to say what sentence it thinks should be passed. It will make sure that the guidelines are complied with and if, in all the circumstances, the sentence is manifestly too lenient, it will have to say so.\\" He continued after an intervention, \\"The social inquiry report is a problem. If the prosecutor is not satisfied with the sentence that is passed, he can ask at the end of the case to see the social inquiry report. I stress that he can do that at the end of the case. It is the property of the court. Only convention has prevented the prosecution from having sight of the social inquiry report that is prepared for the benefit of the court. Once the prosecutor decides that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, he will advise the Crown prosecuting solicitor, who will then submit grounds of appeal to a single judge of the Court of Appeal. If the single judge thinks that it is an appropriate case to go before the Court of Appeal, there will be a full hearing. Under new clause 20 the Court of Appeal would have the power to increase the sentence on the accused if, in all the circumstances, it was seen to be manifestly inadequate. In a courtroom there are a number of factors that we must consider. The state is there not only to represent the interests of justice and to prosecute the case, but to make sure that justice is seen to be done. In those circumstances, it is important to allay much of the dissatisfaction of the general public by ensuring that sentences are seen to be fair and balanced and that both sides of the courtroom‚Äîthe defence and prosecution, the state's representatives and the victim's representatives‚Äîhave the same treatment and equality. In that way we will develop consistency in sentencing and we will ensure that justice is seen to be done on a consistent basis.\\" After another intervention he continued yet further, \\"One of the reasons why I introduced the new clause is that I believe that weaknesses exist in clause 29 as it stands. I commend my right hon. and hon. Friends, the Ministers in the Home Office, for accepting that there is a need to review lenient sentences. My advice to them in the circumstances is that clause 29 does not go far enough. It could be strengthened by the adoption of new clause 20. I have certain reservations about clause 29. It involves the Attorney- General in a political role that he has not had before. This will mean that should a sentence be highlighted in the tabloid press, hon. Members will receive hundreds of letters asking them to urge the Attorney-General to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. That is an entirely new role for the Attorney-General, and that is a road down which we do not want to travel. It will ultimately lead to questions in the House about specific cases at Question Time when the Attorney-General answers questions. I respectfully suggest that that is the wrong way for us to proceed. My next point is more fundamental. If an accused person receives a manifestly inadequate sentence, that will leave the victims and, in the case of murder, the deceased's relatives, with a feeling of deep dissatisfaction. They would then press for the case to be taken to the Court of Appeal, and they will hear the Lord Chief Justice of England say that he is very sorry that the sentence passed on the accused was totally inadequate, but there is nothing that he can do about it. That will bring the law into disrepute. It will rattle some of the faith that the public have in the law. I can see that it will result in TV crews on the steps of the courts in the Strand with the victims in tears saying, \\"How can they do this to me? This is a massive injustice.\\" Clearly, the result will be that the tabloid press will take the matter up and it will become the talk of the day. Pressure will be placed on the House to achieve the result that new clause 20 sets out to achieve. If that is the position that my right hon. Friend and hon. Friends are seeking they can achieve it in the way that I have just described, or they can achieve it by adopting new clause 20. I have proposed new clause 20. If the Government do not accept it, I am prepared to put up with clause 29 in the short term. I am sure that many of my colleagues know that in a short time we shall be back here to put on to the statute book a clause similar to new clause 20.\\"in Hansard Right of Crown to Appeal Against Sentences Orders of the Day ‚Äî Criminal Justice Bill ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 12:30 am on 31 March 1987. = Anonymity of Complainants and Defendants in Sex Cases = Anonymity for rape complainants and defendants was introduced in 1975 but in 1988, at the behest of a Conservative government led by Margaret Thatcher, anonymity for defendants was withdrawn. This remains the case today. When the question of defendant anonymity in rape cases was raised in the House of Commons in 1988 there was concern that if a man accused of rape could be afforded anonymity then what would be the argument against providing anonymity to defendants of other crimes such as murder or theft. If this wider anonymity was introduced, it would offend the old principle of open justice, which ensures the integrity of the justice system by allowing public access to the judicial process. In turn, public scrutiny of the process would be diminished, leading public confidence in it to become dented. Hind followed the government view and took an orthodox line. In a debate in the House of Commons on Right of Anonymity to All Victims of and Defendants in Sexual Offences Cases New Clause 64 of the 1988 Sexual Offences Bill which took place on 28 June 1988 Hind atated, \\"I am probably one of the few Members of Parliament who has defended and prosecuted people charged with rape. I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) about the openness of justice. It is an important point that we must consider. Once we start to protect the identity of some accused people, we are in danger of extending it to others. There is no sound reason why a man accused of rape should have the protection of anonymity while those who are accused of robbery, murder, manslaughter or causing death by reckless driving do not enjoy that protection. Once we open the door, we shall have opened the floodgates to a series of extensions of the rule, which would not be in the interests of open justice.\\" Hind continued, \\"Some hon. Members have suggested that the stigma of being accused of rape is carried by the defendant for the rest of his life. Of course, it is, but whatever the type of offence, the stigma is carried by people accused in every criminal case. There are more serious offences than rape.\\" He further continued, \\"I accept that rape is terrible, but I do not understand why the man accused of rape should have his identity concealed by the courts.\\"in Hansard Right of Anonymity to All Victims of and Defendants in Sexual Offences Cases New Clause 64 ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 4:03 pm on 28 June 1988 We are now at a stage where trial by media, where press coverage fuels public opinion, often begins before the suspect has even been charged. Following the acquittal of Nigel Evans on charges of rape following a trial Hind publicly announced that he had changed his position calling for those accused of sex allegations to be granted anonymity until conviction. Immediately following Evans arrest Hind stated, Evans, \\"had to suffer trial by media as his name was leaked. This is a very strong argument for the names of people under suspicion prior to charge not being made available to the press.\\"in Garston Courier Thursday 9 May 2013 MP Nigel vows to clear his name and thanks his supporters Immediately after the trial, he stated: \\"No-one denies the public‚Äôs right to know but that must come after conviction, not during the trial.\\" Hind supported Evans call for a review of laws that grant anonymity to alleged victims of sex crimes, which he said were \\"unbalanced\\", and questioned the way the CPS had handled recent cases of historic sexual allegations against high-profile people.in Lancashire Evening Post Sunday 13 April 2014 Nigel Evans: ‚ÄòCPS should repay my life savings‚Äô = Tam Dalyell = On 5 June 1986 Hind along with a small group of MPs to the anxiety of the government whips debated through the night to prevent Sir Tam Dalyell MP using Parliamentary time to debate ‚Äò‚Äôthe character of the Prime Minister - Margaret Thatcher‚Äô‚Äô. At 9-57 on Friday morning having been in the chamber all night arranging speakers - Hind talked the previous days business through to defeat Tam Dalyell‚Äôs debate.in Hansard Channel Tunnel [Money ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 8:57 am on 5 June 1986.] Over the course of 11 hours 20 minutes 20 Conservative MPs filibustered attempts by Tam Dalyell to start a debate. Labour MPs were wise to what Hind and his colleagues were doing. As David Winnick, the Labour MP for Walsall North stated at the beginning of the debate on the Channel Tunnel Bill (Committal) stated, \\"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is reported on the tape that the hon. Member for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind) has sent a letter to a large number of his hon. Friends urging them to delay business tonight‚Äîto \\"filibuster\\", the word he has used ‚Äî to ensure that my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) will not have an opportunity tomorrow to move the motion which stands in his name. This matter was raised earlier in the day. I hope that you will agree, Mr. Speaker, that such a filibuster would represent a disgraceful attempt by Conservative Members to deny one of my hon. Friends, who has been successful in the Ballot, the opportunity to debate the subject of his choice. Will the Leader of the House, who is in his place, say whether this filibuster is being actively encouraged by the Government? It is clear that the letter of which I spoke has been sent out by the hon. Member for Lancashire, West and that it contains the word \\"filibuster\\". That hon. Gentleman says in it that, should tomorrow's debate go ahead, Opposition Members would have a platform from which to attack the Prime Minister. Have we reached the stage when an hon. Member cannot debate an issue, having won a place in the Ballot, because to do so would embarrass the Government?\\" Peter Shore, the Labour MP for Bethnell Green and Stepney added, \\"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is a serious matter. Questions were put to the Lord Privy Seal this afternoon about whether or not what I described as a disgraceful manoeuvre was to be organised during the course of this evening and tonight in order to eliminate the debate that is to take place tomorrow. We now know from the letter, which has apparently been published and which came from the hon. Member for Lancashire, West (Mr. Hind), that Government Whips take the view that this must be a Back-Bench filibuster.\\"in Hansard Orders of the Day ‚Äî Channel Tunnel Bill (Committal) ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 10:37 pm on 5th June 1986. Hind himself spoke in the debate, stating that, \\"With regard to the financing of the Channel tunnel project, it is important to emphasise that it will be built with private money and with no contributions from the state. Our deliberations on the money resolution are limited to the essentials of any Government Department overseeing this type of scheme, the purchase of land and the financing of the safety authority. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) mentioned financing the tunnel to ensure that it is managed, operated and maintained for a period should construction come to a halt. My hon. Friend also raised the possibility of some form of bond. If because of heavy costs or unforeseen engineering difficulties the whole of the burden of the programme was thrust upon the taxpayer, the one thing which the invitation of funding from the private sector sought to avoid would occur. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Minister of State are considering that matter and will ensure that the public interest is properly protected. On behalf of my colleagues, I echo the Secretary of State's comments and I thank the Minister for his unfailing courtesy in his dealings with us throughout the night.\\"  PPS to David Trefgarne and the Tea Room Incident  In 1986 Hind was appointed PPS Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister responsible for Defence Procurement, David Trefgarne, 2nd Baron Trefgarne where he monitored Labour's policy on nuclear disarmament. = Trident and Britain‚Äôs Nuclear Defence Policy = Hind was a fervent advocate of nuclear defence. In a debate in the House of Commons on Defence which took place on 30 June 1986 Hind caustically argued, ‚ÄúThe abandonment of Trident would cause a large deficit. The Labour party wishes to negotiate the American nuclear bases out of Britain. Does it not know that that would result in the loss of more than just those nuclear bases? I believe, from comments heard in Washington, that it would result in the withdrawal of 300,000 American troops from Europe, and would put a great deal of pressure upon NATO. The Labour party's arguments are intellectually dishonest. It condemns nuclear arms and wishes to withdraw them unilaterally from the United Kingdom, but also wishes to remain in NATO under the umbrella of the American nuclear capacity. Labour Members wish to remain in the club, but do not want to pay the membership fee. The Americans will not stand for that. They will say, \\"This is an alliance and everyone standing within it pays their way. You cannot be a member unless you are prepared to take the good with the bad.\\" Hind continued, \\"Trident is so far advanced that it would be foolish to call it off.‚Äô He proposed, ‚ÄòWe should press ahead with a weapon that will be a deterrent and prevent attack from the Soviet Union.\\" He strongly advocated the principle of ‚ÄòPeace Through Strength‚Äô, arguing, \\"We should negotiate nuclear disarmament from a position of strength, and Trident would provide us with that strength. The most recent offer from Mr. Gorbachev has come about because we have been negotiating from strength. We should consider his offer carefully because it provides a good basis from which to negotiate sensibly a verifiable mutual nuclear disarmament ‚Äî not the unilateralism that has been urged upon us, with the hope that neutralism will follow. Britain's history defies neutrality in any respect. It is foolish. We cannot become Switzerland overnight, as many Labour Members seem to believe.\\" Hind was unequivocal, \\"We are on the right lines in relation to our policy on Trident. Even if it is never used, it plays an important part in negotiations on nuclear disarmament, and will have been worth every penny spent on it to make the world a safer place.in Hansard First Day's Debate Defence ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 4:12 pm on 30 June 1986. Earlier in the debate he had pointed out that, \\"What has brought the recent advances in negotiations on disarmament of conventional and nuclear weapons at all levels? The reason simply is that, through the defence policy pursued by Britain, the United States and NATO, we have shown our determination to defend ourselves from aggression and potential domination by the deployment of cruise missiles, by the introduction of Trident and by the maintenance of our defence commitment by increasing it by 3 per cent. every year during the past five years..\\" He underlined the fact that, \\"We tell the Soviet Union that we shall negotiate disarmament, because that is what we want, but we shall negotiate only from strength. That is where the Labour and Liberal policies on defence break down. They can never negotiate from strength. If one does not negotiate from strength ‚Äî if one has nothing to negotiate ‚Äî one will achieve nothing. One will merely weaken the NATO Alliance.\\" Hind was the source of the damning press accounts for Labour over the argument between Jim Callaghan MP former Labour Prime Minister and John Prescott MP in the House of Commons tea room over nuclear disarmament,Populist bruiser takes up diplomacy: John Prescott rejects suggestions that he is too hotheaded for the role of Labour leader. Donald Macintyre reports in The Independent Saturday 25 June 1994 later to be confronted by John Prescott leading to further press stories. In this period the government cancelled the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod project and purchased the American Boeing AWACS system Airborne early warning and control.  PPS to John Cope  In 1987 after the general election Hind was appointed PPS to the Minister for Small Businesses John Cope John Cope, Baron Cope of Berkeley in the Department of Employment and was involved in the creation of training and enterprise councils, trade union and employment legislation and abolition of the National Dock Labour Scheme. = The National Dock Labour Scheme = In a House of Commons Debate on 8 May 1989 on the Bill to Abolish the National Dock Labour Scheme in which Hind spoke he stated, \\"the problem of the dock labour scheme is that, unfortunately, not enough ships are seen in dock labour scheme ports,\\". He continued, \\"the dock labour scheme has clearly deterred investment because companies will not invest in ports covered by the scheme. That has deprived inner cities of investment in thousands of acres of derelict land in cities such as London, Glasgow and Liverpool, which is on the edge of my constituency.\\" Hind further stated that, \\"Employment in scheme ports has contracted.\\" He drew contrast with, \\"Non-scheme ports that handled little or no cargo in the 1940s, such as Felixstowe, have adapted, prospered and expanded; they show how modern, well-managed ports can use technology to secure prosperous and well-paid employment. I am afraid that that is in marked contrast to what has happened in dock labour scheme ports.\\" For Hind the problem was the nature of contracts in scheme ports. He argued, \\"the contract of employment in scheme ports must be the only contract of employment known to English and Scottish law that contains a criminal sanction if the employer employs somebody who is not a registered dock worker or whatever the scheme implies. Such criminal sanctions are nonsense in this sort of society.\\" He also raised the issue of, \\"the question of jobs for life.\\" Hind argued, \\"Although those people can all be made redundant from their jobs, under the dock labour scheme, redundancies to reduce the work force are impossible.\\" He also drew attention to, \\"ome of the abuses within the dock labour scheme‚Äîfor example, ghosting and bobbing. There are examples in Garston and also in Liverpool, where three registered dock workers must be employed each day between Monday and Friday for the reception of scrap on to the quay prior to loading. Those men are ghosts. They play no part in the operation. If the ships are bigger, upwards of 16 ghosts can be employed there. They must he employed by the employers.\\" Hind continued, \\"dock labour scheme ports, has been crucified by this ridiculous scheme. There was no possibility of any meaningful discussions with the Transport and General Workers Union about this scheme.\\"House of Commons Debate on the Bill to Abolish the National Dock Labour Scheme Columns 591, 592, 593 = At the Northern Ireland Office = In 1988 Hind became PPS to the Minister for Minister of State for Security and Finance at the Northern Ireland Office, once again John Cope and between 1989 and 1992 then PPS to Peter Brooke Peter Brooke, Baron Brooke of Sutton Mandeville, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement Hind was Chairman of the Joint Anglo-Irish Committee on Environment and Education and a member of the Joint Anglo- Irish Agreement Parliamentary Committee.Paul Bew, Henry Patterson, Paul Teague Between Peace And War: The Political Future of Northern Ireland = The Anglo-Irish Agreement and Cross- Border Security Issues = In his auto-biography Across the Floor: A Life in Dissenting Politics the then Conservative MP Peter Temple-Morris who described Hind as \\"a barrister from Lancashire who believed in the direct approach and didn't tolerate fools gladly\\" described a speech which Hind gave in camera during a meeting of the Dublin Plenary on 3 December 1991 in the Irish Parliament which he said, \\"ignored the wise tradition that a PPS kept silent, particularly on matters concerning his own department.\\" Temple-Morris revealed how Hind, \\"made a 'robust speech' on cross border security, in which he lectured the Irish (fatal mistake) that they were not pulling their weight on their side of the border, by making comparison to the magnificent efforts the British were making on theirs.\\" He admitted that, \\"No doubt he was repeating some concern, privately expressed, within the Northern Ireland Office, and thought it needed saying.\\" Temple-Morris concludes that, \\"Whether it needed saying or not, the debate from that moment, literally took off. He said, \\"press pencils on both sides accelerated across pages.\\"[Irish Times 04th December, 1991] Speaker after speaker from the British and Irish delegation piled in to the debate, according to Temple-Morris, with official spokesmen on both sides coming together to try and calm things down. He thought Hind lacked awareness and \\"thought he had promoted a great debate.\\"in Peter Temple-Morris Across the Floor: A Life in Dissenting Politics It was a view shared by Brian Barton and Patrick J. Roche in their book The Northern Ireland Question: perspectives and policies who describe Hind's attack as astonishing but place it in the context of what they conclude was the cooling of, ‚ÄúThe open British love affair with officials in the Irish government and with [the Irish premier Dr. Garrett] Fitzgerald‚Äù.in Brian Barton and Patrick J. Roche The Northern Ireland Question: perspectives and policies It was a view echoed by Peter Catterall, Wolfram Kaiser, Ulrike Walton-Jordan in their book Reforming the Constitution: Debates in Twentieth-Century Britain. They claim that the \\"Anglo-Irish Agreement did not deliver what Margaret Thatcher and the British Government hoped it would.\\" The Intergovernmental Conference they argued gave the Irish Government a significantly enhanced role within Northern Ireland and over the British administration of direct rule. They claim that, \\"The extent of British disquiet can be appreciated in Ken Hind's attack on the Irish government for its failure to deliver on the security aspects of the agreement, pointing out that violence was at a much higher level in 1991 than in 1985.\\"Peter Catterall, Wolfram Kaiser, Ulrike Walton-Jordan Reforming the Constitution: Debates in Twentieth-Century Britain p292 It was a view further elaborated by Ulrike Jordan and Wolfram Kaiser in their book Political reform in Britain, 1886-1996: themes, ideas and policies in which they pointed once again to the fact that, \\"The extent of British disquiet can be appreciated in Ken Hind's attack on the Irish government for its failure to deliver on the issue of cross-border security.\\"Ulrike Jordan and Wolfram Kaiser Political reform in Britain, 1886-1996: themes, ideas and policies In other words, all that Hind was doing was expressing the Northern Ireland Office view. It is surprising that Temple-Morris was not aware of such a view Hind, as PPS to the Minister for Minister of State for Security and Finance at the Northern Ireland Office had expressed the view previously in the House of Commons. On a debate on Port and Border Control aspects of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Bill which took place on 30 January 1989 Hind pointed out that, \\"the border between the Six Counties and the Republic is not a natural border. It is very long and impossible to police adequately, and people do not always cross it using roads. They go down many of the cart tracks that criss-cross the border. But the majority of the arms, explosives and equipment used by the IRA is brought into Northern Ireland via that border. Many of them are brought into the Republic from all over the world. People who cross the border immediately come under suspicion.\\" He continued, \\"People who have an honest and legitimate explanation for their movements have nothing to fear. Anyone who is carrying on his business normally has nothing to fear from the schedule. But if people cannot give an adequate explanation, there must be further investigation. Common sense applies very much in this regard. It is nonsense...to say that the people who live there and who cross the border regularly should be exempt from strip searches. Those are exactly the people who should be searched, if they cannot give a reasonable explanation. They must be asked, \\"If you have nothing to fear, why do you not go through the normal check points? Why do you cross fields or use cart tracks?\\" in Hansard Port and Border Control Orders of the Day ‚Äî Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Bill ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 7:15 pm on 30th January 1989.] = Private Members Bill on Embryo Research = In February 1988, Hind presented a Private Member's Bill to control embryo research and invited along with a Parliamentary British delegation to an audience with the Pope. In a debate in the House of Commons on 4 February 1988 Hind introduced the Bill stating that a Department of Health & Social Security Report identified the fact that, \\"there are deep feelings inside and outside the House over the sensitive issue of embryo research.\\" Hind revealed that he was president of the charity Action Research for the Crippled Child in his constituency. For Hind, \\"there [was] a deeper and more fundamental argument about the nature of life. Whatever view we may take about this, our view of life and its creation is fundamental to this issue.\\" Hind explained that, \\"The major division between us is that those of us who would outlaw research on embryos believe that life begins at fertilisation, inside or outside the womb. Once fertilisation begins there is the potential for life.\\" Hind went on to explain, \\"It has been suggested that the embryo has only the chance for life. Not only has it a chance for life; the embryo is life. We should not forget that fundamental point. It has also been said that the embryo has a chance to develop. I would argue that we should not deprive that life of the chance for development. Embryonic human beings must not be treated like laboratory rabbits. Research on embryos would bring about such treatment. Most important of all, embryos should have not just a chance for development. The issue is about human rights. It is about the right to live and the most important issue of human dignity. We must consider the fact that those embryos have the right to live. It is their human right to live, and we must protect that right.\\" For Hind, \\"For too long the law has ignored the rights of the unborn child. We will be able to protect those rights when legislation is introduced on this matter. We will be able to vote and correct the imbalance that has existed for many years.\\" He continued, \\"Another argument that is put against it is what I would call the \\"not yet\\" fallacy‚Äîthat the embryo is not yet a person, not yet a member of the human race, and for that reason it is quite all right to treat it as a spare, to be experimented on and frozen. These things are permissible, but I totally reject all of these arguments. I take the view ‚Äîand I am sure that many of my hon. Friends will take the same view‚Äî that the embryo is a person with the potential for life and has human rights. We must respect those rights.\\" He further continued, \\"Everybody in the human race started as that little cluster of cells that has been much maligned. That cluster of cells has led to life for people throughout this country and the world. We must respect it. One of the problems in the attitude of those engaged in embryo research is the failure to accept that need for respect.\\" Hind stressed the urgency of the Bill, arguing, \\"In the past few months, since introducing my Bill, I have considered some of the research that is going on. No one has come forward and said that he has made a major breakthrough with the use of fertilised embryos in research. It has been a case of saying, \\"Tomorrow, tomorrow.\\" But, while we do nothing, these things march on.\\" On that basis, \\"It is time to deal with the problem.\\" He believed, \\"Legislation cannot be brought forward soon enough. I look forward in the next few months to debating this most important subject.\\"Private Members Bill Debate 4 February 1988 Column 1246 In a House of Commons Debate which took place on 23 April 1990, Hind stated, \\"We are debating an issue that attracts strong feelings\\" He stated he had, \\"received many letters on the subject. I also received a petition signed by 800 constituents urging me to vote,\\" in support of controlling embryo research. Indeed, he revealed that, \\"At 7 o'clock this evening, one of my constituents felt that she had to send me a telephone message that she is against embryo research. That is the sort of feeling,\\" he said, \\"that the issue attracts.\\" He argued, \\"that there needs to be some recognition of the limitations on research and a recognition of when life begins. Those issues lie at the root of the problems.\\" \\"Science,\\" he argued, \\"Science cannot be the be-all and end- all; there must be control.\\" He further argued, \\"we must decide fundamentally when life begins. For me, the essential part of life is when the ovum and sperm join at the moment of conception, whether that is inside the womb or outside in the case of IVF. It seems that it is an insult to common sense to suggest that there can be a 14-day gap from that moment during which some hon. Members wish to allow research to take place. It is being said that there is some sort of limbo in which life does not exist. Life must begin at the moment of conception, and from that point it must be respected and, therefore, protected.\\" Hind stated, \\"As a lawyer, I can tell the Committee that there is no specific definition of when life begins. Voting for,\\"a an amendment in the Embryo Research Bill introduced by the Government following the failure of his own Private Members Bill , he believed, \\"will lay down a definition of where we the law-makers, supported by scientific evidence, believe that life begins\\" He continued, \\"Once that has been laid down, it can be followed by a series of protections for the unborn child. I do not accept that the fertilised embryo is, for the first 14 days, merely a cluster of undifferentiated cells. It is the source of life from which life grows and it must be respected as part of life. It is not good enough for hon. Members to say that in the gap from day one to day 14 nothing happens, that it does not exist, and that in some way it is a pre-embryo that has no life, no personality, no existence. That is nothing more than an excuse for those who support research to justify what they have done and what they intend to do in the future under the Bill.\\" Hind argued, \\"We must stand firm and give a lead. We must give a definition and provide a framework for the future, both for the law and for science. It is our duty to establish that, and no one else will take on that duty. Although we are laymen, it is a duty that we must accept.\\" It was his belief that, \\" Hind concluded that, \\"for sound moral reasons because we would be protecting life, providing definition to it and giving a framework of morality to what we are doing. Those of us who respect life will recognise that it is important to do that.\\" On that basis he encouraged Parliament to, \\"vote in favour of [the amendment he supported] and against the Bill as drafted.\\"Debate on the Governments Embryo Research Bill in Hansard 23rd April 1990 Column 98 & 100 In a further debate on the 2nd Reading of the Bill which took place in the House of Commons, on 20 June 1990 Hind stated, \\"although I support IVF, I am totally opposed to destructive research.\\" He continued, \\"when an embryo is fertilised, an individual is created. I do not subscribe to the view that there is a pre- embryo period of 14 days when, in effect, nothing exists but that, at the end of that period, there is an embryo capable of growing into a human being. The most offensive aspect of the Bill as it stands is that it means that embryos can be created, used and destroyed. That means destroying embryos which, if implanted in the mother's womb, would have grown into human beings. To destroy embryos is totally unacceptable to me, to my colleagues on both sides of the House and to those who share the view of the all-party pro-life group in the House.\\" He expressed his deep concern that, \\"here is no effective control in the Bill over the creation for the purpose of research of embryos which can be sold on. A trade could develop and embryos would, in effect, be sold on for any purpose or any use. Those who share my view regard that as totally unacceptable and an insult to humankind.\\" For Hind the key question was, \\"stop a trade in fertilised embryos? Where will it lead us? It will lead us down a slippery slope, down which many hon. Members will not logically want to go in any circumstances.\\" He continued, \\"there [is] no legislative protection for the unborn child at that time. It is something that I believe in. Many hon. Members share that view.\\" Hind argued that, \\"Three major arguments are important to [the amendment being put forward by Pro Life MPs.] The first is that it will have no effect on in vitro fertilisation. That is very important. That has been put to me by parents who are infertile. Secondly, and most important, it will prevent the creation of embryos for research and ultimate destruction. Thirdly it is my considered opinion that if this amendment had been in operation, the research that was carried out by Professor Steptoe and Professor Browne which led to the IVF implantation of fertilised embryos and consequently the birth of children would have continued. They were not thinking in terms other than the fact that they were providing children for infertile parents. Purely and simply, that was their aim. They took it no further. They were not thinking of research to further contraception which this amendment will prevent. That is a fundamental argument for the amendment.\\" He continued, \\"A large amount of research can be carried out without using embryos. The impression gained is that there is no other means of solving the problem of infertility other than the use of embryos. Many of us recognise that that is nonsense. Destructive research is something that I deplore and oppose.\\"Embryo Research Bill Debate in Hansard 20 June 1990 Column 849 & 850  Membership of Committees and Position on Various Political Issues  During his service in the House of Commons he served on standing committees on criminal justice, employment, media, small business, local government, prevention of terrorism, armed forces and health. In Parliamentary debates and votes on the EU, Hind strongly supported Margaret Thatcher's proposal to enter the Single Market and supported the government's privatisation programme. Hind was MP candidates friend in !990 to Colette Jones Northern Ireland Conservative in the Upper Bann By-election, the first contested by the Conservatives since 1945 and the first time since the \\"Equal Citizenship\\" campaign had sought to get the major UK parties to organise in the province. 1990 Upper Bann by-election Jones received 1,038 Votes. Ulster Unionist Party candidate David Trimble is now a Conservative Peer. = Mirror Group Pension Funds = In December 1991 Along with David Shaw (British politician) MP for Dover used the privilege of the House of Commons in a debate on Pension Funds during which he mentioned a Private Members Bill he had introduced on Pension Funds to introduce evidence of irregularities in the Pension Funds under the control of the Late Robert Maxwell, owner of the Daily Mirror into the public arena. In the debate which took place in the House of Commons on 12 December 1991 Hind stated, \\"I have two major concerns. The first is the long-term need to protect pension fund contributors, and the second, which has worked as a catalyst, is the appropriation from the Daily Mirror and Maxwell Communication Corporation pension fund, of between ¬£300 and ¬£500 million by the major shareholder, the recently deceased Mr. Robert Maxwell. That in itself points to the need for closer consideration of the matter and probably for reform. Earlier today, in support of this debate, I introduced a Bill to provide a framework of protection for contributors to and beneficiaries of pension funds. In future, large occupational pension funds will be a major source of British wealth. It is not without significance that we have obliged the public to contribute to pension funds to provide for their old age. We must also provide a framework which will protect them and ensure that those funds are available to benefit them when the time comes. As the population ages, pension funds will become more significant as support for large numbers of workers in their old age and will play an important part in investment in the economy. We need only look around the City and at company reports to see the importance of pension funds as a form of investment in our major companies and in the economy. First, I want to address the problems of Mirror Group Newspapers and the Maxwell Communication Corporation. This debacle‚Äîthat is the only word to describe it‚Äîmust under no circumstances be allowed to happen again. That, as much as anything, is what this debate is about.\\" He continued after allowing an intervention, \\"Mr. Robert Maxwell, a former Labour Member of Parliament, was the subject of an inquiry in respect of his company, Pergamon Press. The inspector's report said of him: This man should never be allowed to control a public company. 1070 How right that inspector was. How foolish we were not to take due note of that incisive comment, by a man who read Mr. Maxwell's character extremely well.\\" He further continued, \\"Robert Maxwell helped himself to the Mirror pension fund. While professional journalists‚Äîrightly, in my view‚Äîinvestigated the financial misdeeds of others, Maxwell had his hand in their pocket and robbed them blind. That was not all. A more serious aspect is that, after Robert Maxwell's death, we are led to believe by the newspapers that a further ¬£300 million went missing from the group's various pension funds, which suggests that such activities went deeper than just one man, and that others were involved. They too must be called to account, and we know that those matters are now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. The existing law has failed us in respect of the proper control and management of pension funds. The law is clearly defined. It is based on the law of trust‚Äîand most pension funds are trusts. There was a major judgment on that subject in 1883. In the case of Speight, the judges held: Trustees also have a duty to act diligently and prudently‚Ä¶in selecting an investment the trustee must take as much care as a prudent man would take in making an investment for the benefit of persons for whom he felt morally obliged to provide. They were saying, in the language of the Victorian era, that a trustee should be as prudent in his selection of investments as he would be in dealing with his own. More recently, in the case of Cowan v. Scargill in 1984, the same sentiment was repeated in modern-day language: Trustees are required to exercise their powers in the best interest of present and future beneficiaries; trustees must put on one side their own personal, social, or political views\\". Those are clear guidelines to the way in which pension funds should operate. The Maxwell affair has clearly shown that a coach and horses was driven through that law, so we must consider carefully the need to change it.‚Äù After allowing another intervention Hind continued further, ‚ÄúMy Bill would not allow a director or shareholder to serve as a member of the pension fund trust of the employer company. Control of the pension fund should be at arm's length, by independent persons who are not involved in the management of the employer company. Robert Maxwell proved the undesirability of having directors or chairmen who are in control of both the company, as majority shareholders, and the pension fund. He was a fund trustee, along with his two sons, so effectively he controlled both the company and the fund. That led to the problems that the fund faces today. If one individual holds a dominant commercial position in respect of a pension fund, he or she will be able to direct those who operate the fund, in the same way that he or she manages the company‚Äîand will be able to select those 1071 persons who are to serve as trustees and manage the fund. That clearly happened in respect of the MGM and MCC pension funds.‚Äù After a further intervention Hind continued, ‚ÄúMy Bill advocates that there should be no nominee companies, and that a pension fund should be a recognised legal entity. The people who control a fund should be clearly defined, as should the rights of contributors. I will return to that aspect later. If one person dominates the fund, directors are appointed by this majority shareholder, as well as the trustees. On 31 January, Lord Williams of Elvel, Labour's deputy leader in another place, and a director of Mirror Group Newspapers, addressed their Lordships on that very point‚Äîon corporate governance. He raised questions on comments made by my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Industry and Technology, saying‚Äî‚Äú At this point he was upbraided by the Deputy Speaker, Betty Boothroyd who stated, ‚ÄúOrder. The hon. Gentleman is, I think, aware that hon. Members are not allowed to quote directly what has been said by a Member of the Upper House unless that Member is a Minister. I should be obliged if the hon. Gentleman would paraphrase.‚Äù Hind responded, ‚ÄúLord Williams of Elvel was talking about chief executives, and about non-executive directors confirming what he described as the outrageous ambitions of a chairman or chief executive. Now, the outrageous ambitions of another chief executive, unfortunately deceased, have been revealed for all to see. Perhaps Lord Williams and one or two others should take their own advice.‚Äù After some procedural debate Hind further continued, ‚ÄúAn important aspect of the relationship between directors and trustees is illustrated by the closeness of the relationship between the Mirror Group Newspapers pension fund and the companies. The accounts for last year contain an interesting section headed \\"Investment Report\\". It states As part of this process, the following changes were made in the structure of the Scheme's investment. Due to uncertain stock market conditions and relatively high interest rates, the Trustees instructed its investment managers to sell stocks, and hold an average of 20 per cent. of their portfolios in the form of cash deposits\\". The trustees and directors must have been aware‚Äîas it was in the report‚Äîthat they were converting stocks into cash, which the company could subsequently borrow and invest in other Maxwell companies. As we know, that is probably what happened. It almost seems as if preparations were made for what subsequently took place. The report continues: a further ¬£12,034,000 was invested in the Common Investment Fund...this fund is managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management (BIM) in conjunction with other pension funds managed by the Pergamon Group Pensions Departments. The Scheme's participation in the CIF remains crucial to the Trustee's overall strategy\\". The management of a pension fund must be independent of the employer company. BIM‚Äîa company that was charged with the management of a large proportion of the pension funds‚Äîwas a private company wholly owned by the Maxwell family. Effectively, they were appointing the directors and staff, and, therefore, handling all the funds from the pension schemes. We are not discussing an arm's-length transaction. If legislation is to be drawn up, as I advocate in my Bill, that is precisely the sort of abuse that we should set out to prevent.‚Äù Further interventions took place following which Hind stated, ‚ÄúWhile...people were investigating other people's pockets, Robert Maxwell had his hand in their pockets and was robbing them blind. That is a fact of life. I feel deeply sorry for them, and hope that their experience will be a salutary lesson that will help the rest of the country to avoid repeating it. We cannot avoid the fact that the people appointed to manage the funds must carry some responsibility. Sycophants and nominees of the dominant majority shareholder of the employer company must not be in a position to manage the company. Lord Donoughue, a Labour peer, was one of the directors of Bishopsgate until fairly recently. Interestingly enough, Madam Deputy Speaker, he is reported to have said in another place‚Äî[Interruption.]‚ÄîI mean, Mr. Speaker. I apologise‚Äîit was the wig that threw me. In the other place, Lord Donoughue said that tame directors were often appointed‚Äîfriends of the majority shareholder, who would not ask too many awkward questions.‚Äù Following prompting from the floor Hind adopted the term, flunkeys to describe such individuals arguing, ‚ÄúWe must ensure that no more flunkeys are appointed to pension funds. It is not in the interests of the general public.‚Äù He yet further continued, ‚ÄúThe fourth matter to which the House should give serious consideration is the proportion of any pension fund that can be invested in the employer company. I shall listen with interest to what my hon. Friend the Minister says about that. I know that the Government are giving serious consideration to restricting to 5 per cent. the proportion of a total fund that may be invested in the employer company. I would certainly advocate that as a sensible course. It would prevent a pension fund from collapsing should a company go into receivership. A recent example from the north-west was provided by the Lewis's stores group, which has recently gone into receivership. It was the subject of a motion under Standing Order No. 20 on which, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I spoke some months ago. The receivers found that in February 1990 the company had sold an empty building in Bolton to the pension fund for ¬£2.4 million. That building has not returned any profit to the pension fund and since then, I am told, it has declined in value. In April 1990, ¬£250,000 worth of contributions to the pension fund were not paid by the company. The following summer, that company borrowed ¬£1.25 million from the fund. That sum has not been repaid, and since then the group of companies has gone into receivership, been broken up and sold. The money is probably lost to the pension contributors and beneficiaries. Although the group owned several department stores, it was not a big company. We must act with care to guard against such things happening.‚Äù After another intervention he made his fifth point, stating, ‚ÄúThe fifth point to be included in a Bill is that there should be a declaration that the assets of the pension fund are the property of the contributors and not of the employer company. A case has been decided on those lines, but the principle has not yet gained widespread acceptance. The first time when such a case came to my notice was in the mid-1980s when BTR‚Äîthe Birmingham Tyre and Rubber company‚Äîtried to take over the Pilkington Group, which is one of the major employers in my constituency. On that occasion, it was made clear to me by the employees who worked and lived in my constituency 1074 that they had real anxiety that the balances that were oversubscribed in the pension fund would be taken by BTR as part of the takeover and would be used for the benefit of BTR because they would be regarded as part of the acquisition. It is important that we make it clear that that should not be allowed to happen, and that all payments into the pension fund are the property of the contributors and of the beneficiaries. If that principle were established, even if there were oversubscriptions, the contributions would be carried forward in perpetuity for the benefit of future contributors and future recipients of pensions. Mirror Group Newspapers is a similar case. To whom do overpayments into a pension fund belong? At Mirror Group Newspapers, there has been a recent holiday payment for the company of the 14 per cent. that should have been made into the pension fund. That means that the company is benefiting from what would normally pass into the company pension fund for the benefit of the employees. I should like such practices to end, and we should take a clear look at the problem. Oversubscriptions should be not for the benefit of the employer company, but for the benefit of the contributors and of those who will receive pensions from the fund.‚Äù After further interventions, Hind made his concluding remarks, ‚ÄúThe fifth point to be included in a Bill is that there should be a declaration that the assets of the pension fund are the property of the contributors and not of the employer company.

There was competition for Capital Funding in Lancashire for New Hospitals in Lancashire in Chorley and Ormskirk. In an adjournment debate on the construction of a new and modern hospital wing at the present Ormskirk general hospital in west Lancashire.which took place on 16 March 1984 Hind bluntly stated, \\"The Ormskirk general hospital is the main acute ward, operating, emergency and accident centre for west Lancashire and is based upon Ormskirk and Skelmersdale, and covers the large area of surrounding agricultural villages. Until 1982, the plans that had been in force for many years to construct a new hospital at Ormskirk had been one of the priorities of the North-West regional health authority, and, until 1983, it was planned to construct the hospital in 1986‚Äì87. It is now being reconsidered under the capital programme for that region, and is likely to slip back in terms of date of construction and priority behind a hospital that it is proposed to construct at Chorley. This,\\" he argued, \\"is not satisfactory.\\" He went on to explain why. He stated, \\"The Ormskirk general hospital is the main general and surgical hospital for an area stretching north-south from the river Ribble, in the north, to Rainford on the outskirts of St. Helens, in the south, and from Southport and Formby in the west\\" to the outskirts of Wigan. It takes into the area two small towns, and a population of well over 100,000. It is the main emergency and accident centre for that area, and it is ill-equipped to provide the kind of services which it is called upon to provide. The major problem with the hospital is that the major acute wards are situated in nissen huts, built in the early 1940s for the treatment of wounded service men who at that time were taken to what was then a cottage hospital on the outskirts of Liverpool. Those nissen huts were built with a temporary life of about 10 years. They have reached the stage where their repair is far beyond justifiable cost. An acute patient at Ormskirk general hospital is taken from one of those nissen huts in an electric wagon, which looks very much like a milk float with solid steel sides, to the operating theatre along a small road that passes through the centre of the hospital. When the patient has been operated on, the reverse process is carried on. This hospital is one of the few remaining hospitals which have such wards. Surely in 1984, some 33 years after the construction of these hospital wards, this cannot be an acceptable way to conduct health care. The fact that these wards will be very costly to replace is supported by the district health authority and the responsible works officer. The operating theatre at the hospital is some 50 yards from the wards, and the patients must travel on these carts come rain, hail, shine or snow. Whatever the weather, they have to experience this unsatisfactory procedure. The operating facilities at west Lancashire, although very adequate, are not suitable for an area of this size as a civilian emergency centre, which is the role they are called upon to carry out. In recent years, the M58 was constructed through west Lancashire. If more than a handful of people are involved in an accident on the M58, and require surgery, they will have to be taken to Preston, which is 16 miles away. That cannot be acceptable. Their chances of survival must be much more limited than if a proper hospital, capable of providing the necessary accident and emergency facilities of sufficient quality, were built at Ormskirk. The third problem, which is not often considered, is the position of the staff and consultants at the hospital. They took their posts on the understanding that in future they would work in a modern, properly furbished hospital. It does their morale no good if their new hospital slips beyond the targets originally planned for 1986‚Äì87. The answer to all those major problems is to provide a hospital wing that is capable of providing operating theatres, acute wards and proper medical facilities for the treatment of acute patients, all of which are associated with a modern civilian emergency centre. That is what was planned for the Ormskirk hospital in the third phase of its development, to be built in 1986‚Äì87.\\" In summary he concluded, \\"I...urge the regional health authority to reconsider its position. New facilities would provide more than 130 acute beds, eight intensive care beds, children's beds, 17 adult care beds, five operating theatres, an accident and emergency unit, fracture clinic, six X-ray rooms, a plaster theatre, an anaesthetic department and various administrative and ancillary facilities.\\" He continued, \\"Since 1981, when the Chorley district health authority was created, Chorley began to be given priority over Ormskirk by the North-West regional health authority. The arguments must be examined. In the late 1970s, a magnificent new hospital was built in Preston for the patients of that area. At that time, Chorley was included in the Preston area. The people of Chorley can still go to their hospital and benefit from its facilities.\\" \\"The arguments about Ormskirk have not changed.\\", he argued, \\"The facilities remain the same and the hospital remains the same. The pressing need has not changed, but the regional health authority has changed its mind. The authority,\\" he stated, \\"should have another look at the matter.\\" He argued that there needed to be a reconsideration by \\"the regional health authority...whether it is satisfying the needs of patients in west Lancashire when it is not providing them with what would surely be expected in every other town and city ‚Äî a proper hospital with acute beds and a sufficient number of wards. Money has been spent in west Lancashire, plans have been made and the hospital is just about ready to be built. The slippage means that all the time, effort and resources put into developing a modern hospital for Ormskirk are in danger of being wasted. That is not acceptable.\\"in Hansard Orders of the Day ‚Äî Ormskirk General Hospital ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 2:22 pm on 16th March 1984. Columns 583 & 601 In 1990 Hind obtained his desired objective. In an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on 18 April 1990 on Wrightington Hospital outside Warrington Hind revealed, \\"In the past 12 months we have been granted ¬£25 million by the North Western regional health authority to build a new hospital. I am pleased to say that it is now under construction. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health recently visited West Lancashire to cut the sod to start building the new hospital.\\"in Hansard Orders of the Day ‚Äî Wrightington Hospital ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 10:37 pm on 18 April 1990 Column 1526 The patients of Chorley will not be harmed by waiting a few more years for the development of their hospital. The patients of Ormskirk have waited for 20 years, and that is long enough. It is time for reality to take over and for proper facilities to be provided for patient care. = Pilkingtons = Hind fought to prevent Pilkingtons PLC being taken over by BTR from Birmingham who described themselves as a ‚Äôrust bucket operation‚Äô. After the takeover was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission employees at Lathom research centre presented Hind with a glass bucket engraved \\"Our bucket wont rust\\". At Prime Minister's Questions on 13 January 1987 Hind asked the Prime Minister, \\"Will my right hon. Friend take time during the course of her busy day to look at much of the press comment about the takeover bid by BTR for Pilkington? Will she bear in mind, especially in the light of the arguments about the north- south divide, the importance of Pilkington to the north-west region and have words today with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and urge him to refer that takeover bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission?\\" Margaret Thatcher replied \\"As my hon. Friend said, that is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who must wait to receive advice from the Director General of Fair Trading.\\"in Hansard Engagements Oral Answers to Questions ‚Äî Prime Minister ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 12:00 am on 13 January 1987. Hind kept up the pressure for a referral to the Monopolies and Merger Commission when he asked the Secretary of State Paul Channon in a debate in the House of Commons on BTR and Pilkington Brothers which took place on 15 January 1987, \\"Does my right hon. Friend appreciate the disappointment of many of the Pilkington employees in the north-west at the non-referral of BTR's bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission? However, some Conservative Members appreciate that there was a major lack of a monopoly element that would have provided him with the major ground to do so. Will he bear in mind that, through research and development and hard work, a loyal work force in Pilkington has made that company the premier glass manufacturer in the world? That loyalty will not easily be transferred to a conglomerate run by BTR? Will he ensure that the Pilkington shareholders will, having seen the impressive profit forecasts and long-term stable investment, be allowed to maintain their investment free from the sort of interference that we saw in the Guinness bid for Distillers in the recent past?\\"in Hansard BTR and Pilkington Bros. ‚Äì in the House of Commons at 3:45 pm on 15 January 1987. Hind was successful. The decision was taken by the Government to refer the attempted takeover to the Monopolies and Merger Commission which ruled it was not in the public interest for the takeover to take place. = Acid House Parties = Hind took part in a discussion on the Granada TV programme Upfront on so called Acid House parties arguing in favour of bringing them under the existing licensing legislation.[Viewers hear of Acid problems in The Observer 20 March 1990] In a debate in the House of Commons on Orders of the Day ‚Äî Entertainments (Increased Penalties) Bill - the Regulation of so-called Acid House Parties - a Bill which he was a sponsor of which took place at 9:34 am on 9 March 1990 Hind stated, \\"I and many of my colleagues remember going to major music festivals such as that at the Isle of Wight and the national jazz and blues festival at Windsor. We understand such events and we enjoyed them. I promoted a concert at which the best selling album in the world was recorded ‚ÄîThe Who Live at Leeds in 1971. That was one of many concerts that I promoted. I faced problems with the police, the local authority, the fire service and so on. I assure anyone considering the Bill that no legitimate promoter has anything to fear from it.\\" Later in the debate he revealed, \\"there has been a great deal of concern about the matter. A Granada television programme called \\"Up Front\\" will be shown next Friday. It will be produced in the warehouse and will highlight for young people throughout the north-west\\".[Call to extend nightclub hours r: Answer to Acid House scourge? In The Lancashire Evening Telegraph 8 March 1990] Yet later in the debate he further explained, \\"that there is a great deal of fun to be had from open air concerts. I well remember the Isle of Wight music festivals and the national jazz and blues festival, which was promoted on racecourses all over the south-east in the late 1960s. They were major events that were enjoyed by many people, including some who are now Members of this place. Of course 20 years have passed. We know that there is much to be enjoyed at such events. I cannot emphasise too strongly that we are not in the business of destroying young people's fun. On the contrary, we are concerned to protect them in a way that will free them from risk so that they can enjoy the music that they go to hear and the entertainment generally that they seek. The Bill will enable them to do exactly that. It will prevent them also from being exploited by the organisers of some acid house parties. It will stop young people from being damaged by attending them. The Bill does not do anything that is especially radical. It does not create new offences. Instead, it provides teeth for the existing legislation. It requires all those who run acid house parties to obtain a licence from the local authority. If the organisers break the conditions of the licence, a heavy fine or a sentence of imprisonment will be imposed upon them. If they fail to apply for a licence, they can be fined up to ¬£20,000 or sentenced to six months' imprisonment.\\" He argued, \\"That might seem draconian in some respects, but when we consider how acid house parties have been operated over the past few years it is clear that there is a national problem. Many of the parties have been run in dangerous circumstances. There has been a lack of safety and dangers have faced the attenders, the customers. Major disruption has been caused to the locality in which the parties have taken place.\\" He went on, \\"I hope that the public will realise that it is not only Conservative local authorities that are calling for action to be taken in respect of the problems that arise from acid house parties. It is an issue that crosses party lines; it is recognised by Labour and Liberal-Democrat local authorities as well as by Conservative authorities.\\" He further continued, \\"The most important feature that we have to consider is the protection of the young people who go to acid house parties. He revealed that, \\"in Blackburn, Lancashire, where an acid house party took place last month. He told us‚Äîthis was reported in the press‚Äîthat there were exit signs over doors which if opened would have led to no fire escape or staircase. Anyone who opened them would have been faced with a huge drop, resulting in death. That is typical. The organisers of acid house parties are using old warehouses, tents in fields or other premises which are often derelict. There are obvious and immediate dangers. The legitimate promoter of a concert is subject to a series of rules and regulations that bear on numbers, fire safety, electricity and lighting. They relate to a range of matters and they are designed to protect those who attend these events. At the ad hoc acid house party it is not the organiser who is in danger but the customer and the performers. Promoters have been exploiting those who attend by selling drugs. In a recent case a promoter of an acid house party was sent to prison for 10 years for peddling drugs at the parties. There is also a problem because of the lack of safety and access to such parties. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) gave a good example of a field being used for a party in his constituency. Suddenly 5,000 young people descended upon it. The cars that brought them blocked the lanes adjacent to the field. If there had been an accident due to lack of adequate fire and safety precautions it would have been impossible for ambulances and fire engines to get through. A legitimate promoter takes safety factors into consideration In addition the local authority issues an entertainment licence for an event and would ensure that there was proper access, but that does not happen in the case of illegal acid house parties. The local inhabitants of the area surrounding the party are also affected. They are hurt more than any other people and there is nothing that they can do about it. They can call the police but if it is an impromptu party the police will have had little notice of it, and the local authority will know nothing about it. Thousands of young people can descend on a site causing noise, traffic congestion and disruption to the local inhabitants\\" He said he spoke, \\"from personal experience. The location of some of the parties is amazing. A few months ago I went to a housing estate in the middle of Skelmersdale to meet members of the residents' association. They told me that acid house parties were taking place on the estate and they took me to the site of the parties, which was a flat. Hundreds of young people were milling about. It caused disruption, particularly for parents with young children trying to sleep through the noise of traffic. The Bill will ensure that those problems‚Äîthe noise of traffic and the disruption to people's lives‚Äîwill be controlled. I suspect that the major fear of the general public is that the Bill will restrict freedom to party‚Äîto use the expression of those who attend‚Äîbut of course it will not. The whole House accepts that the promoters of acid house parties or entertainment events of any kind have responsibilities to the public living in the immediate vicinity and to the young people who attend. At the moment the amount of money that can be made by promoters of pay-parties is so enormous that they can afford to pay a fine of ¬£2,000. If one makes thousands of pounds from a party‚ÄîI am informed from investigations into the matter that many promoters do‚Äî¬£2,000 is just part of the overheads and a small amount, so they can drive a coach and horses through the law and disregard the consequences. The Bill is intended to deal with cowboy operators‚Äîthe people who do not care about their customers or the inhabitants of the area surrounding the party and are only interested in making vast amounts of money.\\" He argued, \\"having obtained a licence, a promoter may then completely ignore the local authority's terms and conditions. He will be as guilty of endangering the lives of his customers and the community as an unlicensed acid house party organiser. The law cannot be sterile in that regard; it cannot stand back and do nothing. A local authority may impose requirements involving exits and gangways, and ban fire hazards such as accumulated rubbish and unsafe electrical equipment. Those of us who remember the Bradford City football ground fire will know how dangerous rubbish can be. A local authority may require the provision of adequate sanitary appliances and proper ventilation and‚Äîmost important of all‚Äîstipulate a maximum number who may attend, and the provision of adequate fire-fighting equipment. Any legitimate licence holder who breaches those requirements must be dealt with as severely as anyone else. A licence holder making vast amounts of money may ignore important safety provisions precautions because a ¬£2,000 fine is not worth worrying about. That could mean sending many people to their deaths, or at least laying them open to the possibility of injury. Parliament cannot afford to take such an attitude.\\" He believed, \\"suggestion of a maximum fine of ¬£20,000, with the option of six months in prison, would constitute a big deterrent for cowboy operators hoping to escape the full force of the law. That is a maximum, however, and would not be used in every instance. I am a lawyer. The maximum penalty that can be imposed by the criminal courts is, I have found, rarely imposed. The court considers the breach of the licence conditions, the circumstances of the breach, the circumstances surrounding that evening's events and then weighs up the seriousness of the breach. A promoter who puts the facts properly before the court and who has acted reasonably will not be in difficulty...Magistrates will realise that he has done his best to stay within the law and they will deal with him accordingly ‚Äîin contrast to the way in which they will deal with the cowboy operator. A maximum fine of ¬£2,000 is insufficient to deal with potential cowboys who apply for a licence and then completely disregard the conditions attached to it. If an illegal acid house party takes place, the local authority can issue a licence after the event, to the effect that a statutory nuisance‚Äîthat of noise‚Äîhas been committed. However, the nuisance has been committed; it does not help those who suffered as a result of the nuisance to deal with it after the event. Members of the public can prosecute in the magistrates courts, under the noise abatement provisions of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, alleging breach of privacy. They have to prove in court that enjoyment of their property has been disturbed. However, as prosecution takes place after the event, such measures are inadequate...The Bill would provide local authorities with more powers. They would be able to deal with noise nuisance more forcefully. I understand that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Health is considering whether noise at acid house parties is causing damage to health and whether anything can therefore be done to control noise levels at such parties. We must prevent dishonest promoters of acid house parties from exploiting young people for personal gain. We must ensure that the legislation is strong enough, which it is not at the moment, to deal properly with such people. I welcome the [promise] to introduce measures which will lead to the confiscation of profits over ¬£10,000 made at illegal events when the promoters of such events have been found guilty in the courts. That will add to the deterrent provided by my hon. Friend's Bill, and that fact should be made known to the public.\\" Hind concluded, \\"the legitimate operators of events such as some of the acid house parties that have been promoted for public entertainment will have nothing to fear if they run a legitimate event, ensure that drug dealers will not be there exploiting our young people, prevent any criminal activities from taking place, work with the police on car parking, traffic and nuisance, approach the local authority for a licence and adhere to its conditions. Our young people will then be able safely to enjoy the entertainment that those operators present. The House wishes to encourage operators who provide proper, legitimate entertainment for our children. We do not wish to encourage people who are interested only in making a quick buck at the expense of our young people and without concern for their safety.

Interviewed for the programme he recounts how, \\"I had kept in contact with my chambers, although I hadn't done a case for a number of years, so I was able to go back.\\" He continued, \\"But, of course, people who were in the office, many of them didn't even know who I was, I had been away for so long. And, of course, clients didn't know who you were. So you had to work really hard to get back into it.\\" Hind further continued, \\"There was a very solid group of people who really didn't think you were sufficiently professional. They didn't trust you, didn't think you were serious about doing the job because you were an ex-MP.\\" He concluded, \\"There was an element of mistrust, particularly in the legal profession. They really didn't take us seriously, they thought we were playing at politics.\\"in Beyond Westminster 02/01/2010 The programme drew on a study carried out by Professor Kevin Theakston and Christopher Byrne Research Assistant both of Leeds University.Leaving the House: the challenges former MPs face after leaving Parliament in LSE British Politics & Policy Blog Theakston & Byrne conclude that the transition into a ‚Äòpolitical afterlife‚Äô is not as straightforward as some might think.

Dubai: Oriental Press. 192 pp. . and spotted night adder.'' Description These snakes are small and stout, with an average length of 30-60 cm. Grows to a maximum size of about 70 cm, or perhaps slightly larger. The snout is obtuse with a rounded rostral scale. A single loreal is present. The circumorbital ring consists of 2-3 preoculars, 1-2 postoculars and 1-2 suboculars. There are 6 supralabials and 9-10 sublabials. Four sublabials are in contact with the sublinguals. There are 2-3 temporal scales. At midbody there are 17-19 rows of dorsal scales. The ventral scales number 118-137 in females and 124-144 in males. The subcaudal scales number 14-23 in females and 15-26 in males. Within the range of this species, the ventral scale counts increase from south to north and from east to west. This diagnostic information is apparently according to Hughes (1977). Spawls and Branch (1995) give a slightly different description of the body scalation: midbody there are 17-22 rows of dorsal scales, which have been described as soft and feebly keeled. The ventral scales number 124-151 in females and 118-154 in males, with the highest numbers found in specimens from Uganda and Ethiopia. The color pattern usually consists of a brown ground color, sometimes grayish, olive or light green, with a series of dark brown or blackish patches down the back (this pattern is less distinct on the first quarter of the body). The flanks are sprinkled with black scales. There is much variation in the dorsal pattern; some specimens, especially those from more arid regions, may have no pattern at all, making them hard to identify. Those from DR Congo are often a uniform brown. The belly may be white, cream or pinkish-gray. The ventral scales may be uniform in color, but sometimes each scale grades from light to dark, giving the belly a finely barred appearance. The head usually has a distinct V-shaped mark. This mark may be solid black in juveniles, but in adults it becomes brown with a black outline. Sometimes, a short dark line is present extending backwards from the posterior of the eye. Geographic range Mauritania and Senegal east to western Ethiopia, south to DR Congo and northern Angola. The type locality is listed as \\"Liberia, Western Africa.\\" Mallow et al. (2003) mostly quote Spawls and Branch (1995), giving the range as West- and Central Africa, from Senegal east to Chad, southeast to DR Congo and northeast into southeastern Sudan. Also found in the river gorges and low country of southwestern Ethiopia, southwest to northern Angola and DR Congo. Habitat Found in an amazingly wide range of habitats, including forests, savannah and even semi-desert. It may be quite common in parts of its range. Behavior Terrestrial, but is known to climb into low bushes in pursuit of frogs. They are relatively slow moving, but can strike quickly, tending to lash rather than to stab. Despite its name, this species is known to be active at any time of the day, evening or night, and has sometimes been seen sunning itself. They are most active during the rainy season (March‚ÄìOctober) when their prey is available, virtually disappearing during the dry season. Feeding Feeds mainly on frogs and toads. Reproduction Oviparous. Lays 6-20 eggs in February‚ÄìApril, with the hatchlings appearing in May‚ÄìJuly. Venom Bites result in mild symptoms that include pain, moderate swelling, local lymphadentitis and mild fever. Blistering has not been reported while necrosis is rare and usually secondary. The symptoms disappear after two to three days and normally without any complications. No existing antivenins are known to counteract this venom.

The investigation focused on whether the district truly had a \\"gang problem\\" (the local police chief said it did not), or whether the consultant was creating the \\"problem\\", since the consultant stood to gain a sizeable contract if in fact a problem existed. The end result is that there was no real gang problem, and the consultant's contract was terminated. The unique feature of the investigation was that none of the media outlets in the Dallas area had anything to do with it. The investigation was performed solely by the Eagle Eye, the DHS student newspaper. For their role in the story, four members of the newspaper staff received the Courage in Student Journalism Award for their work; the student advisor received the educator's version of the award.

Since 1986, the cathedral in Orvieto has been the episcopal seat of the former Diocese of Todi as well. The building was constructed under the orders of Pope Urban IV to commemorate and provide a suitable home for the Corporal of Bolsena, the relic of miracle which is said to have occurred in 1263 in the nearby town of Bolsena, when a traveling priest who had doubts about the truth of transubstantiation found that his Host was bleeding so much that it stained the altar cloth. The cloth is now stored in the Chapel of the Corporal inside the cathedral. Situated in a position dominating the town of Orvieto which sits perched on a volcanic plug, the cathedral's fa√ßade is a classic piece of religious construction, containing elements of design from the 14th to the 20th century, with a large rose window, golden mosaics and three huge bronze doors, while inside resides two frescoed chapels decorated by some of the best Italian painters of the period with images of Judgment Day. The cathedral has five bells, dating back to Renaissance, tuned in E flat. Construction The construction of the cathedral lasted almost three centuries with the design and style evolving from Romanesque to Gothic as construction progressed. The flagstone of the cathedral was laid on 13 November 1290 by Pope Nicholas IV, and construction was entrusted to chief- mason (capomastro) Fra (Friar) Bevignate di Perugia (also called Fra Bevignate da Gubbio) using a design by Arnolfo di Cambio (the architect of the cathedral of Florence). The cathedral was initially designed as a Romanesque basilica with a nave and two side aisles. However, when Giovanni di Uguccione succeeded Fra Bevignate, the design was transformed into Italian Gothic forms. Construction continued slowly until, in 1309, the Sienese sculptor and architect Lorenzo Maitani (universalis caput magister) was commissioned to work on the church and solve several issues concerning the load-bearing capabilities of the building, especially of the choir. He substantially changed the design and construction of the building, increasing the similarity of the building to Siena Cathedral. The architecture of both buildings sometimes is classified as a substyle of Gothic architecture: Siennese Gothic style. Maitani strengthened the external walls with flying buttresses, which proved later to be useless. These buttresses were eventually included in the walls of the newly built transept chapels. He rebuilt the apse into a rectangular shape and added a large stained-glass quadrifore window. Starting in 1310 he created the current fa√ßade up to the level of the bronze statues of the symbols of the Evangelists. He also added much of the interior. He died in 1330, shortly before the completion of the cathedral, succeeded by his sons. In 1347 Andrea Pisano, the former Master of the Works of the Florence Cathedral, was appointed the new Master of the Works. He was followed in 1359 by Andrea di Cione, better known as Orcagna. The beautiful mosaic decoration and the rose window are attributed to him. The rose window is the most important stained glass window of a cathedral made in the Gothic era. This once octagon-based design was replaced by Orcagna with the new 22-sided polygon. This type of geometrical base is uncommon in Gothic architecture. Due to the windows unusual shape, statistical and geometric techniques were used to achieve a symmetrical design. The Sienese architect Antonio Federighi continued the decoration of the fa√ßade between 1451 and 1456, adding some Renaissance modules. In 1503 Michele Sanmicheli finished the central gable and added the right spire, which was finished by Antonio da Sangallo, Junior in 1534. Final touches to the fa√ßade were made by Ippolito Scalza by adding the right pinnacle in 1590 and the left in 1605‚Äì1607. All in all, the succeeding architects kept a stylistic unity to the fa√ßade. The fa√ßade Maitani) The Gothic fa√ßade of the Orvieto Cathedral is one of the great masterpieces of the Late Middle Ages. The three-gable design is attributed to Maitani, who had clearly undergone some influence by the design scheme for the fa√ßade in Tuscan Gothic style of the Siena Cathedral by Giovanni Pisano (1287‚Äì1297) and the plan for fa√ßade of the Florence Cathedral by Arnolfo di Cambio (1294‚Äì1302). The most exciting and eye-catching part is its golden frontage, which is decorated by large bas-reliefs and statues with the symbols (Angel, Ox, Lion, Eagle) of the Evangelists created by Maitani and collaborators (between 1325 and 1330) standing on the cornice above the sculptured panels on the piers. In 1352 Matteo di Ugolino da Bologna added the bronze Lamb of God above the central gable and the bronze statue of Saint Michael on top of the gable of the left entrance. The bas-reliefs on the piers depict biblical stories from the Old and New Testament. They are considered among the most famous of all 14th-century sculpture. These marbles from the fourteenth and fifteenth century are the collective and anonymous work of at least three or four masters with assistance of their workshops, It is assumed that Maitani must have worked on the reliefs on the first pier from the left, as work on the reliefs began before 1310. The installation of these marbles on the piers began in 1331. They depict from left to right: * stories of the Old Testament: Book of Genesis * the Tree of Jesse with scenes from the Old Testament with messianic prophesies of Redemption. * scenes from the New Testament with below Abraham sleeping: episodes from the lives of Jesus and Mary * Last Judgment: Book of Revelation Above this decoration are glittering mosaics created between 1350 and 1390 after designs by artist Cesare Nebbia. These original pieces have been replaced and redesigned in the centuries since, particularly in 1484, 1713 and 1842. Most of these mosaic represent major scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, from the \\"Nativity of Mary\\" in the lower right gable to the \\"Coronation of the Virgin Mary\\" in the topmost gable. One of these glassmakers is recorded as Fra Giovanni Leonardelli. Central to the mosaics is the large rose window built by the sculptor and architect Orcagna between 1354 and 1380. In the niches above the rose window stand the twelve apostles, while in niches on both sides twelve Old Testament prophets are represented in pairs. Statues in niches is typical for French Gothic cathedrals. It is therefore likely that the sculptors have undergone some influence. Eight statues have been attributed in the records to Nicola de Nuto. The spandrels around the rose window are decorated with mosaics representing the four Doctors of the Church. The frame of the rose window holds 52 carved heads, while the center of the rose window holds a carved head of the Christ. The newest part of the decoration are the three bronze doors which give access to the entrance of the cathedral. These were finished in 1970 by the Sicilian sculptor Emilio Greco (1913‚Äì1995) depicting mercies from the life of Christ and are surmounted by a sculpture of the Madonna and Child created by Andrea Pisano in 1347. The cathedral's side walls, in contrast to the fa√ßade, are more simply furnished with alternating layers of local white travertine and blue-grey basalt stone. The interior The interior The cathedral consists of a nave with six bays and two aisles, and is cruciform in shape. The concept has deliberately been left uncluttered and spacious. The interior, like the exterior, is decorated with alternative rows of basalt and travertine but only to a height of about 1.5 m. The rows above them were painted in alternative rows of black and white stripes in the late nineteenth century. The cylindrical columns also consist of alternate rows of travertine and basalt. Their shape and ornamentation evolved during the construction of the cathedral, as well as the decoration of the capitals. The alabaster panes in the bottom parts of the aisle windows keep the interior cool during the fierce Italian summer, while the neo-Gothic stained-glass in the upper parts of the windows date from 1886 to 1891 and were designed by Francesco Moretti. The trussed timber roof was decorated in the 1320s by Pietro di Lello and Vanuzzo di Mastro Pierno, and was heavily restored in the 1890s by the architect Paolo Zampi and Paolo Coccheri to its current state. During the years 1335‚Äì1338 the transept was roofed with quadripartite (four-celled) stone vaults. Baptismal font Near the left entrance is the large marble baptismal font with lions and elaborate frieze reliefs. It was begun in 1390 by Luca di Giovanni. It was expanded sixteen years later by Pietro di Giovanni from Freiburg, who added the red marble basin, and Sano di Matteo, who sculpted the octagonal pyramid in 1407. Gentile da Fabriano, Madonna Enthroned with Child. It is overlooked by a fresco in International Gothic style of the \\"Madonna Enthroned with Child\\", a Maest√† painted by Gentile da Fabriano in 1425. This is the only fresco saved when the stucco altars were added to the nave chapels in the late 16th century. These altars in turn were destroyed in the 19th century and only fragments of the other 14th- and 15th-century frescoes reappeared. Some of these frescoes are ascribed to Pietro di Puccio (who also painted frescoes in the Camposanto in Pisa). At the beginning of the nave stands a holy water stoup, sculpted by the Sienese architect Antonio Federighi between 1451 and 1456. During that time he also contributed to the decoration of the fa√ßade. Above the entrance of the Chapel of the Corporal stands the cathedral's large organ, containing 5,585 pipes and originally designed by Ippolito Scalza and Bernardino Benvenuti in the fifteenth century before being redesigned in 1913 and 1975. Scalza's other major contribution to the church is the large Piet√† he sculpted in 1579. it took him eight years the carve the four figures in this imposing marble group.  Apse  Partial view of the apse The large stained-glass quadrifore window in the apse was made between 1328 and 1334 by Giovanni di Bonino, a glass master from Assisi. The design was probably made by Maitani. Above the altar hangs a large polychrome wooden crucifix attributed to Maitani. Construction of the Gothic wooden choir stalls was begun in 1329 by Giovanni Ammannati together with a group of Sienese wood carvers. They stood originally in the center of the nave but were moved to the apse around 1540. Behind the altar are a series of damaged Gothic frescoes dedicated to the life of the Virgin Mary, occupying the three walls completely. They were created around 1370 by the local artist Ugolino di Prete Ilario and a few collaborators such as Pietro di Puccino, Cola Petruccioli and Andrea di Giovanni. It took them about ten years to finish. This series of frescoes were the largest in Italy at that time. They have been restored every hundred years for several following centuries. Two scenes, the Annunciation and the Visitation, were redone by Antonio del Massaro at the end of the 15th century. Chapel of the Corporal Chapel of the Corporal The Cappella del Corporale lies on the north side of the main crossing. It was built between 1350 and 1356 to house the stained corporal of the miracle of Bolsena. It is from this chapel that the reliquary with the corporal is carried in religious processions through the town on the Feast of Corpus Christi. The chapel is two bays deep and covered with quadripartite vaults. It is closed off by a wrought iron gate, made between 1355 and 1362 by Matteo di Ugolino da Bologna and finished by Giovanni de Micheluccio da Orvieto in 1364. The chapel is decorated with frescoes depicting on the left wall the history of the Eucharist and on the right wall miracles concerning the bleeding host throughout church history. They were painted between 1357 and 1363 by three artists from Orvieto: Ugolino di Prete Ilario, Domenico di Meo and Giovanni di Buccio Leonardelli. They were painted prior to the frescoes in the apse. They were restored in the middle of the 19th century. The aedicule-shaped tabernacle on the altar was designed in 1358 by Nicola da Siena and finished by Orcagna. In a niche on the right wall stands a panel of the Madonna dei Raccomandati (c. 1320). It was painted in the Italian Byzantine tradition by the Sienese artist Lippo Memmi, brother-in-law of Simone Martini. At the centre of the chapel is the Reliquary of the Santo Corporale in silver, gilded silver and varicoloured translucent enamel containing the bloodstained corporal. This Gothic masterpiece, in the form of a triptych, was made by Sienese goldsmith Ugolino di Vieri between 1337 and 1338. It shows 24 scenes of the life of Christ and eight stories about the corporal. =A martyred mayor= Although it largely goes wholly unnoticed today, the chapel also contains the reason millions of pilgrims came to Orvieto even before the occurrence of the Bolsena miracle and the construction of the cathedral: the tomb of St. Pietro Parenzo. Appointed by Pope Innocent III as the city's mayor with a mandate to restore order, Parenzo's efforts were so successful that the Cathars (i.e., adherents of the Cathar heresy) murdered him in 1199. Thereafter, many related that, from asking Parenzo for his intercession at his tomb, God had granted them their request. As a result, people began flocking in pilgrimage to the Duomo in droves from throughout central Italy, and numerous miracles were reported. Parenzo quickly became honored as a saint. His remains were transferred to the cathedral after its construction. There is an oval window in the center of the altar through can be seen the small coffer which holds them. Chapel of the Madonna di San Brizio Partial view on the vault ‚Äì Christ in Judgment by Fra Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli; other frescoes by Luca Signorelli and his school This chapel was a fifteenth-century addition to the cathedral. It is almost identical in structure to the Chapel of the Corporal. The construction of this chapel (also known as the Cappella Nuova and Signorelli chapel) was started in 1408 and completed in 1444. It is closed off from the rest of the cathedral by two wrought iron gates. The first one closes off the right arm of the transept. It was signed by the Sienese master Conte di lello Orlandi (1337). The second gate stands at the entrance of the chapel and is of a much later date. It was signed by master Gismondo da Orvieto (1516). Originally called the Cappella Nuova, or New Chapel, in 1622 this chapel was dedicated to Saint Britius (San Brizio), one of the first bishops of Spoleto and Foligno, who evangelized the people of Orvieto. Legend says that he left them a panel of the Madonna della Tavola, a Madonna enthroned with Child and Angels. This painting is from an anonymous late 13th- century master from Orvieto, who was probably influenced by Cimabue and Coppo di Marcovaldo. The face of the Child is a restoration from the 14th century. This panel stands on the late-Baroque altar of the Gloria, dating from 1715 and made by Bernardino Cametti. Signorelli's Antichrist Fra Angelico and Benozzo Gozzoli began the decoration of the vault of the chapel in 1447. They painted only two sections: Christ in Judgment and Angels and Prophets as they were summoned in the same year to the Vatican by Pope Nicholas V to paint the Niccoline Chapel. Work came to a halt until Perugino was approached in 1489. However, he never began. After being abandoned for about 50 years, the decoration of the rest of the vault was awarded to Luca Signorelli on 5 April 1499. He added the scenes with the Choir of the Apostles, of the Doctors, of the Martyrs, Virgins and Patriarchs. His work pleased the board and they assigned him to paint frescoes in the large lunettes of the walls of the chapel. Work began in 1500 and was completed in 1503. (There was a break in 1502 because funds were lacking.) These frescoes in the chapel are considered the most complex and impressive work by Signorelli. He and his school spent two years creating a series of frescoes concerning the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment, starting with the Preaching of the Antichrist, continuing with tumultuous episodes of the End of the World, finding a counterpart in the Resurrection of the Flesh. The fourth scene is a frightening depiction of the Damned taken to Hell and received by Demons. On the wall behind the altar, Signorelli depicts on the left side the Elect being led to Paradise and on the right side the Reprobates driven to Hell. He added to these expressive scenes some striking details. The Damned are taken to Hell and received by Demons *The Preaching of the Antichrist was painted shortly after the trial on charges of heresy and execution of the Observant Dominican friar, Giralamo Savonarola in Florence on 23 May 1498. The Antichirst is depicted under the influence of the incarnated angel named Satan who suggests him what to say, while touching his rib cage. The analogy of the Antichrist sowing discord by preaching slander and calumny, would not have been lost on late 15th-century viewers. To underscore the contemporary analogy, at lower right, Signorelli includes recognizable portraits of the young Raphael, in a striking pose; Dante; possibly Christopher Columbus; Boccaccio; Petrarch; and Cesare Borgia, and, on the left, he depicts himself, dressed in noble garments, and Fra Angelico, in his Dominican habit. *In the left background the Antichrist is expelled from heavens by the archangel Michael, and his acolytes killed by a rain of fire. In the right background he depicts a large, domed temple in the Renaissance style.. *The End of the World is painted over the arch of the entrance to the chapel. Signorelli paints frightening scenes as cities collapse in ruins and people flee under darkened skies. On the right side below he shows the Sibyl with her book of prophesies, and King David with raised hand predicting the end of the world. In the left corner below, people are scrambling and lying in diverse positions on the ground, producing an illusion as if falling out of the painting. This successful attempt in foreshortening was striking in its day. The Elect in Paradise *The Resurrection of the Flesh is a study by Signorelli, exploring the possibilities of the male and female nude, while trying to recreate a three- dimensional setting. Signorelli shows his mastery in depicting the many positions of the human body. The risen, brought back to life, are crawling in an extreme effort from under the earth and are received by two angels in the sky blowing on a trumpet. *The Damned are taken to Hell and received by Demons is in stark contrast to the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of the horrible fate, the agony and the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse. *The Elect in Paradise shows the elect in ecstasy looking up to music-making angels. The few extant drawings, made in preparation for this fresco, are kept in the Uffizi in Florence. They show each figure in various positions, indicating that Signorelli must have used real models in the nude to portray his figures. Piet√† wall painting Below this are smaller paintings of famous writers and philosophers watching the unfolding disaster above them with interest. Legend states that the writers depicted here are Homer, Empedocles, Lucan, Horace, Ovid, Virgil and Dante, but the identifications are disputed by modern scholars. Several small-scale grisaille medallions depicting images from their works, including the first eleven books of Dante's Purgatorio, Orpheus, Hercules, and various scenes from Ovid and Virgil, among others. In a niche in the lower wall is shown a Piet√† that contains explicit references to two important Orvietan martyr saints, S. Pietro Parenzo (podest√† of Orvieto in 1199) and S. Faustino. They stand next to the dead Christ, along with Mary Magdalen and the Virgin Mary. The figure of the dead Christ, according to Giorgio Vasari, is the image of Signorelli's son Antonio, who died from the plague during the course of the execution of the paintings. This fresco was Signorelli's last work in the chapel. But Tom Henry in his book \\"The Life and Art of Luca Signorelli\\" (Yale University Press, 2012) states that Vasari's story is not correct: \\"Signorelli had two sons, Antonio and Tomasso. Tomasso outlived his father and Antonio was alive when this Lamentation was delivered in February 1502, dying a few months later in July 1502.\\" (Preface, p. xiii) Palazzo dei Papi The Papal Palace attached to the right of the cathedral was originally begun in the mid-13th century when the popes moved to Orvieto to escape conflict in Rome. Pope Urban IV and Pope Martin IV both lived in the town and probably oversaw construction of the initial stages of this building. Pope Boniface VIII extended the building, but it was left unfinished following the papal move to Avignon in 1309. It remained a papal residence until 1550, when it was passed to the ownership of the cathedral, who after using it as a residence for some time redesigned it in 1896 as a museum, which it remains today. Inside is information and artifacts detailing the history of the cathedral and town. Disused works from the cathedral interior and pieces of original construction removed during later restoration can be seen in the museum, including paintings, reliquaries and the original plans for the cathedral's construction. The ground floor of the building also houses a museum dedicated to the Sicilian artist Emilio Greco who constructed the cathedral's bronze doors in 1970. The museum contains a wide selection of his works, as well as preparatory papers and sculptures of other large pieces, including several which are housed at St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. Palazzo dell'Opera del Duomo Opposite the cathedral is a large grand building constructed in 1359 to house the cathedral's administrative offices and enlarged in 1857 to create a museum on the ground floor housing Etruscan artifacts discovered around the city, which was once a major Etruscan capital. Next door to this building is the Claudio Faina museum, which houses the substantial collection of Etruscan art collected in the nineteenth century by Count Mauro Faina and bequeathed to the city.

Accessed March 18, 2020. \\"Dr. Furstenberg was born in Berlin in 1935. His family, which was Jewish, was able to leave Germany just before the start of World War II and made its way to the United States, settling in New York City in the Washington Heights neighborhood in Manhattan.\\" He attended Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy and then Yeshiva University, where he concluded his BA and MSc studies at the age of 20 in 1955. Furstenberg published several papers as an undergraduate, including \\"Note on one type of indeterminate form\\" (1953) and \\"On the infinitude of primes\\" (1955). Both appeared in the \\"American Mathematical Monthly, the latter provided a topological proof of Euclid's famous theorem that there are infinitely many primes. Academic career Furstenberg pursued his doctorate at Princeton University under the supervision of Salomon Bochner. In 1958 he received his PhD for his thesis, Prediction Theory. From 1959‚Äì1960, Furstenberg served as the C. L. E. Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Furstenberg got his first job as an assistant professor in 1961 at the University of Minnesota. Furstenberg was promoted to full professor at Minnesota but moved to Israel in 1965 to join at Hebrew University's Einstein Institute of Mathematics. He retired from Hebrew University in 2003. Furstenberg serves as an Advisory Committee member of The Center for Advanced Studies in Mathematics at Ben Gurion University of the Negev. In 2003, Hebrew University and Ben-Gurion University held a joint conference to celebrate Furstenberg's retirement. The four-day Conference on Probability in Mathematics was subtitled Furstenfest 2003 and included four days of lectures. In 1993, Furstenberg won the Israel Prize and in 2007, the Wolf Prize in mathematics. He is a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities (elected 1974), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (international honorary member since 1995), and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (elected 1989). Fustenberg has taught generations of students, including Alexander Lubotzky, Yuval Peres, Tamar Ziegler, Shahar Mozes, and Vitaly Bergelson. Research accomplishments Furstenberg gained attention at an early stage in his career for producing an innovative topological proof of the infinitude of prime numbers in 1955. In a series of articles beginning in 1963 with A Poisson Formula for Semi-Simple Lie Groups, he continued to establish himself as a ground-breaking thinker. His work showing that the behavior of random walks on a group is intricately related to the structure of the group - which led to what is now called the Furstenberg boundary ‚Äì has been hugely influential in the study of lattices and Lie groups. In his 1967 paper, Disjointness in ergodic theory, minimal sets, and a problem in Diophantine approximation, Furstenberg introduced the notion of ‚Äòdisjointness,‚Äô a notion in ergodic systems that is analogous to coprimality for integers. The notion turned out to have applications in areas such as number theory, fractals, signal processing and electrical engineering. In his 1977 paper, Ergodic behavior of diagonal measures and a theorem of Szemer√©di on arithmetic progressions, Furstenberg used methods from ergodic theory to prove a celebrated result by Endre Szemer√©di, which states that any subset of integers with positive upper density contains arbitrarily large arithmetic progressions. His insights led to important results, such as the proof by Ben Green and Terence Tao that the sequence of prime numbers includes arbitrary large arithmetic progressions. He proved unique ergodicity of horocycle flows on compact hyperbolic Riemann surfaces in the early 1970s. In 1977, he gave an ergodic theory reformulation, and subsequently proof, of Szemer√©di's theorem. The Furstenberg boundary and Furstenberg compactification of a locally symmetric space are named after him, as is the Furstenberg‚ÄìS√°rk√∂zy theorem in additive number theory. Personal life In 1958, Furstenberg married Rochelle (n√©e) Cohen, a journalist and literary critic. Together they have five children and sixteen grandchildren.

The fire of 1616 and damage during The Deluge in 1657 resulted in the further destruction.

Duprey said \\"I, I shouldn't have got stuck in this galaxy!\\" Andr√© Breton, fascinated by the darkness and imagery in Duprey's poetry, invited the author to Paris in 1948. Duprey's books are not a celebration of death, neither do they find comfort in thinking about it. All questions asked in the poems of his last book The End and the Means (1970) are left unanswered, but their author found a way somewhere \\"beyond\\" (Jouffroy, 1970, quoted in ). He had a sense for scandals, too. One day he went to the grave of the Unknown Soldier by the Arc de Triomphe and urinated on the eternal flame Duprey jailed for which he was arrested and beaten in the jail; later also taken to a mental hospital. Between 1951 and 1958 he did not write and concentrated on working on sculptures. He wrote his final book in 1959 and upon completion, he asked his wife to send the manuscript to Breton. When she returned from the post office, she found him dead; he had hanged himself in his studio. Three days before his death, he said calmly to a friend: \\"I am allergic to this planet\\".

He was the chief financial officer of British banking group Prudential from 2007 to 2009, and then its CEO until 2013. Born into a prominent political family in the Ivory Coast, he holds dual Ivorian and French citizenship. He studied advanced mathematics and physics in France before joining the management consultants McKinsey & Company in 1986, where he worked until 1994. From 1994 to 1999 he worked in the Ivory Coast first as chief executive of the National Bureau for Technical Studies (BNETD). Following the 1999 Ivorian coup d'√©tat, he resumed a private sector career and rejoined McKinsey in Paris from 2000 to 2002, then worked as a senior executive for Aviva before being recruited by Prudential. Early life and education Thiam was born in the Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire) on 29 July 1962. He is a descendant of two prominent families from Senegal and Ivory Coast. On his mother‚Äôs side, he is a descendant of Queen Yamousso, after whom the capital of C√¥te d'Ivoire, Yamoussoukro, is named. Thiam's mother, Marietou, was the niece of Chief F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, the founder and first President of C√¥te d'Ivoire (known for the quote \\"People are surprised that I like gold. It's just that I was born in it\\"). His father, Amadou Thiam, a journalist, was born in Senegal and emigrated to C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1947. He supported Houphouet-Boigny in his fight for the independence of the country and served more than ten years in the Ivorian cabinet after independence. Tidjane‚Äôs uncle, Habib Thiam, was Prime Minister of Senegal for more than 10 years and also served as President of the National Assembly. In 1982 Thiam was the first Ivorian to pass the entrance examination to the √âcole Polytechnique in Paris. In 1984, he graduated from the √âcole Polytechnique and in 1986 from the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Mines de Paris where he was top of his class. In 1986 he was offered a scholarship to study for an MBA at INSEAD and join the McKinsey Fellows Programme' in Paris. He received an MBA from INSEAD in 1988 (Dean's list). In 1989 he took a one-year sabbatical from McKinsey to participate in the World Bank's Young Professionals Program in Washington, D.C. He returned to McKinsey in 1990, working first in New York City and then in Paris. Government career In December 1993, the first Ivorian President, F√©lix Houphou√´t-Boigny, died and was replaced by Henri Konan B√©di√©. In April 1994, at the request of the new President, Thiam left France and McKinsey to go back to Abidjan and become the CEO of the National Bureau for Technical Studies and Development (BNETD), an infrastructure development and economic advisory body with more than 4,000 staff, reporting directly to the President and the Prime Minister. In that role, which had cabinet rank, he was also handling key negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Thiam was also a key member of the Privatization Committee, in charge of privatising extensive state-owned assets. In August 1998, in addition to his role at the BNETD, where he became chairman, Thiam formally joined the cabinet and was appointed Minister of Planning and Development. In his years in C√¥te d'Ivoire, Thiam promoted private sector involvement in infrastructure development. He implemented flagship projects including the Azito power plant (nominated by the Financial Times as one of the boldest successful investment decisions in the world, the renovation of Abidjan airport and the construction of the Riviera Marcory toll bridge, whose financing was closed a few days before the 1999 coup. One of the first actions of the new President, Alassane Ouattara, in 2011 was to start the construction of that bridge as originally overseen by Thiam, with the same promoters. Thiam actively promoted an extensive privatisation programme which saw, between 1994 and 1999, C√¥te d'Ivoire lead African countries by privatising its telephone, services, electric power generation, airports, railways and many companies in the agricultural sector. In 1998, the World Economic Forum in Davos named him as one of the annual 100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow, and in 1999 the Forum named him a member of the Dream Cabinet. In December 1999, whilst Thiam was abroad, the Ivorian military seized control of the government. Thiam returned to the country, where he was arrested and held for several weeks. General Gu√©√Ø, the new head of state, offered him the position of chief of staff, but he declined and left the country in early 2000.  Prudential  Thiam speaking at the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, 2011. On returning to Europe, Thiam was offered a partnership by McKinsey in Paris, becoming one of the leaders of the company's financial institutions practice. In 2002 he joined Aviva, initially as group strategy and development director, then as managing director of Aviva International, chief executive of Aviva Europe and an executive director, sitting on the plc board. In January 2007, after Richard Harvey announced he would step down as chief executive of Aviva, Thiam was tipped as a possible future head of the group. Thiam left Aviva in September 2007 to become chief financial officer of Prudential plc. In March 2009, Thiam was named chief executive, effective from October, after Mark Tucker chose to step down. The appointment made him the first African to lead a FTSE 100 listed company. His departure from the role was announced on 10 March 2015. After he became chief executive, Prudential launched a bid for AIA, the Asian wing of the crisis- stricken AIG. A public battle ensued, with some investors complaining about the $35.5 billion price Prudential was offering to pay. The bid eventually failed, after the AIG board rejected a revised lower bid. AIA was later floated on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the value of the company quickly rose above Prudential‚Äôs original bid price. Thiam came under strong personal criticism following the failure of the bid, partly as a result of the costs incurred by the company in pursuing the bid. However, he was re-elected as CEO at the May 2011 AGM with a 99.3 per cent vote. The company's performance since the bid appears not to have been damaged by its failure - in the first nine months of 2011, Prudential delivered a 14 per cent increase in new business profits over the same period in 2010, with total insurance sales increasing by 10 per cent, while in its full-year results for 2013, Prudential delivered an IFRS operating profit of ¬£2.95 billion, up 17 per cent from the year before. In March 2013, the Financial Services Authority fined Prudential ¬£30m and censured its CEO, Thiam, for failure to inform it of its plans to buy AIA and failure of dealing with the FSA in an open and cooperative manner. Credit Suisse Thiam was appointed chief executive of Credit Suisse in 2015. Thiam was appointed the chief executive officer (CEO) of Swiss investment bank and financial services company, Credit Suisse Group AG on 10 March 2015. An hour after his appointment was announced, the company stock increased by 7.5%. During his first two years, he led the bank through a restructuring process cutting costs and jobs. His compensation was US$9.9 million in 2016 and $10.2 million in 2017. His pay was originally scheduled to be $11.2 million in 2017, however it was reduced after shareholder backlash. From 2016 to 2019, Under Thiam, Credit Suisse expanded their wealth management business and generated net new assets of CHF121bn (‚Ç¨113.7bn), and their pre-tax profit from wealth management grew double-digit (+15%) for four years in a row, from ‚Ç¨2.5bn in 2015 to ‚Ç¨4.4bn in 2019.https://africanbusinessmagazine.com/african- banker/tidjane-thiam-fall-of-a-legend/ In March 2018, Thiam detailed a new profitability track for the company by stating: \\"We've been cleaning up a lot of undesirable trades that we should not have done... There's no way to clean up the past, given the legacy we have, without generating losses. We have profitable operations of the company.\\" Resignation In September 2019, he became involved in a scandal with Iqbal Khan, a former employee of Credit Suisse who had transferred to UBS. Khan, Credit Suisse's former head of Wealth Management, accused Thiam of sending spies after him. The two, who were also neighbors, were alleged to have fallen out over personal issues earlier on. In October 2019, Credit Suisse cleared Thiam of ordering the botched surveillance. The Homburger inquiry presented its report to the Credit Suisse board and said that Bou√©e, not Thiam, had independently made the call to follow Khan. Bou√©e resigned and was later sacked ‚Äì although he has said since that he intends to sue the bank. The head of global security also resigned.https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/business/credit-suisse-ceo- resigns/index.html On February 7, 2020, Tidjane Thiam resigned amid a power struggle which followed the spying scandal.Irish Times: \\"Credit Suisse chief Tidjane Thiam quits after spying scandal\\" In a statement, Thiam said: \\"I had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place,\\" Thiam said in the statement.BBC Shares in Credit Suisse more than halved from a late February high through a mid-March low as banks slumped on worries about the impact of sweeping lockdowns across most of Europe put in place to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (on February 8, 2020, UBS was at 70% of its March 2015 stock price, Credit Suisse 55%).https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/credit-suisse-boosts- employee-shares-after-sharp-price-drop International development Thiam (ninth on the left) at a meeting with Africa Progress Panel, 2011 In October 1999 Thiam was appointed by James Wolfensohn as one of 20 members of the External Advisory Council of the World Bank Institute, which the Institute relies on for advice and guidance. Thiam is a member of the Africa Progress Panel (APP), a group of ten distinguished individuals who advocate at the highest levels for equitable and sustainable development in Africa. Every year, the Panel releases a report, the Africa Progress Report, that outlines an issue of immediate importance to the continent and suggests a set of associated policies. In 2012, the Africa Progress Report highlighted issues of Jobs, Justice, and Equity. In January 2011 Thiam was appointed chairman of the G20's High Level Panel on Infrastructure Investment. Established by the Seoul G20 summit in 2010, the panel was a grouping of figures from leading financial institutions and development agencies given the task of producing concrete proposals to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure projects in emerging economies. The panel submitted its report to the G20 Summit meeting in Cannes in November 2011. In 2013 Thiam was one of the authors of ‚ÄúA Partnership for the Future‚Äù, a report prepared at the request of the French Minister for the Economy and Finance by five French and Franco-African political and economic experts. The report set out proposals for building a new economic partnership based on a business relationship between France and the African continent, particularly the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. Thiam is a member of the UK Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group and he is one of UK Trade & Investment's Business Ambassadors. Awards and honors Thiam was chairman of the Association of British Insurers between July 3, 2012, and October 1, 2014. Thiam is a member of the International Business Council of the World Economic Forum. He was a non-executive director of the French chemicals company Arkema until November 2009. In 2007, Thiam was elected INSEAD Alumnus of the Year by the Insead Alumnus Association. In 2009, he was nominated as one of \\"50 Alumni who changed the world\\" as part of the celebration of the 50th anniversary of INSEAD and its 38,000 graduates. He was ranked number one in both 2010 and 2011 by the annual publication the Powerlist, which ranks the 100 most influential Africans in the UK. In July 2011, Thiam was awarded the rank of Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur by the French government in recognition of his significant contribution to civil life for more than 20 years. In 2013, he was awarded the Grand Prix de l‚Äô√âconomie, organised by Les √âchos and Radio Classique, in partnership with law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. In July 2018, business and finance magazine Euromoney named Thiam \\"Banker of the Year 2018\\", citing his \\"radical three- year plan\\" that had \\"reinvented\\" Credit Suisse. Personal life Tidjane was married to Annette Anthony Thiam, an African-American lawyer who used to work for Joe Biden, and they have two sons. Tidjane's eldest son Bilal Thiam died of cancer in May 2020 at the age of 24. Tidjane and Annette separated in 2015, and divorced in 2016.

Research within WCM focuses on several areas related to production, characterisation and applications of magnetic materials. The scope of the Centre's research activities has recently been broadened by the addition of several new academic staff, allowing the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to capitalise on the anticipated growth of research opportunities in collaborative, interdisciplinary projects in magnetism and magnetic materials. Computer aided design in magnetics, electromagnetic machines, magnetic imaging, high permeability materials, magnetostriction, magnetic sensors and actuators, nanomagnetic materials, magnetic thin films and multilayers, magnetic material for data storage, theory and modelling of magnetic materials are all areas of research currently under investigation in the centre. Postgraduate research and industrial contract projects are carried out with the support of equipment and research facilities recently upgraded through major infrastructure investments. WCM has collaborative links with leading research groups in magnetics throughout Europe, Asia, North and South America, Japan, China, India and Korea. Its members participate regularly in conferences, networking and collaborative research projects both nationally and internationally. Facilities The Wolfson Centre for Magnetics has a wide range of state of the facilities within its laboratories, which support the research and industrial consultancy activities. Ongoing investment, including an award from the EPSRC/EST Joint Infrastracture Fund (JIF) in 2003 helped in continuous improvement of existing infrastructure and a Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF) awarded in 2005-2006. The existing facilities include: An example of a measuring system AC and DC properties The power loss, permeability, apparent power, flux density, magnetic field, Barkhausen noise, magnetostriction characteristics of soft magnetic materials and hard magnetic materials can be measured with a range of test systems under DC, AC and rotational magnetising conditions. These systems enable material in a wide range of geometries to be tested from 0.001 Hz up to 200 kHz with controlled arbitrary waveforms. Stress and temperature annealing Several of the AC and DC characterisation systems can be used with the sample under stress (¬±50 kN) or at a pre-defined temperature (varied from ‚àí150 ¬∞C to +600 ¬∞C using an environmental chamber, laboratory oven or oil bath). Micro/nano scale characterisation High magnification domain observation system uses the longitudinal and polar Kerr effect for dynamic observation of surface domain structures at a maximumum rate of 1825 frames per second and maximum magnetification of 500 times. Vibrating Sample Magnetometer is used for the DC characterisation of magnetic films, tapes and powders at magnetic fields up to 3 T in the temperature range from 8 K to 1270 K. Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) performs DC characterisation utilising a reciprocating sample and SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) detection for ultimate resolution at magnetic fields up to 5 T. Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) enables the measurement of phenomena such as the magnetocaloric effect, magnetostriction and magnetoresistance over a wide range of temperatures at magnetic fields of up to 7 T. Magnetic properties close to the surface of soft magnetic materials can be analysed using the Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect Potter (MOKE) which utilises the transverse Kerr effect to measure magnetisation loops in samples such as ferromagnetic films. A system for production of amorphous microwires Fabrication of materials There is a magnetic microwire-making room, which is equipped with all units necessary for the production of uncoated and glass-coated amorphous and nanocrystalline wires using rapid quenching from the melt techniques. The room contains: * Pre-alloy preparation unit - capacity 20-200 g, provides 10‚àí6 atm vacuum or inert gas atmosphere. It consist of a quartz chamber and an Edwards Diffstak combined vacuum system. Can be used to prepare metallic pre-alloys containing metals (Fe, Co, Ni), metalloids (P, B, C) and rare earth elements. * In rotating- water quenched wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of metallic amorphous and nanocrystalline wires with cross section diameter around 125 Œºm and length up to 100 m. * Glass-coated wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of glass-coated wires (amorphous and nanocrystalline), with diameter 1-50 Œºm of metallic part and 3-15 Œºm thickness of the glass coating. An induction heater providing an output power of 5 kW at an operating frequency of up to 400 kHz, which operates with multiple workheads and with induction coils of various geometry is used to supply the power for all the above-mentioned units. Modelling and simulation The Centre employs electromagnetic design and analysis software. These are used in the simulation of 2D and 3D electromagnetic applications, such as the design and optimization of electrical machines, non-destructive evaluation, sensors and actuators, permanent magnet devices and high frequency applications. Performance of electromagnetic devices A 3 phase transformer tester is available for the characterisation of production transformers or simulated cores with a rating up to 15 kVA driven by either a constant voltage transformer or selected inverter drives through computer controlled variacs. A range of dynamometers are used for the assessment of the performance of rotating machines up to a maximum speed of 24,000 rpm and maximum rating of 24 kW. Variable loads may be applied using eddy current brakes or DC generators. A wide range of electromagnetic emissions and immunity testing (including conducted, radiated, ESD, surges, interrupts, harmonics and flicker) can be performed with the EMC test suite, which is housed within custom built electromagnetically shielded enclosures. Shielding efficiency of sheet materials under DC and low frequency magnetic fields can also be assessed. Low levels of ambient magnetic field are attained using a 5 layer Mumetal enclosure. Various coil systems and highly sensitive field sensors may be used for the calibration of novel magnetic sensors. Acoustic noise emanating from devices such as transformers, motors and actuators can be measured in the hemi-anechoic acoustic chamber using calibrated microphones. Left to right: Dr David Grant (Vice-Chancellor of Cardiff University), Prof. Jack E. Thompson (first director of WCM from 1969 to 1990), Prof. David Jiles (director of WCM, from 2005 till present) and Prof. Anthony J. Moses (director of WCM from 1990 to 2005) History In 1969 a grant from the Wolfson Foundation of ¬£132,000 was awarded to the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology (UWIST) to establish a research centre to carry out basic and applied studies on magnetic materials and their industrial applications. Professor Jack E. Thompson was appointed the Director of the Wolfson Centre for the Technology of Soft Magnetic Materials. The original objective was to create a unique UK Centre capable of competing at the international level. This objective remains broadly the same today. A property was purchased in 30 The Parade - a street near the University's buildings. In the 1970s the WCM was awarded the multidisciplinary Centre of Excellence recognition by the Science Research Council, the forerunner of today's EPSRC. Professor Thompson was appointed Head of Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University College Cardiff (UCC) and by mutual agreement WCM was transferred to UCC. WCM hosted the Second Soft Magnetic Materials Conference (SMM2) in 1975 and the Centre's name was changed to the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics Technology reflecting its broader range of expertise and activities. The Wolfson Centre hosted SMM5 in 1985 and research carried out at the Centre became commercialised with the establishment of one of the University's first spin out companies, MR Sensors Ltd., to manufacture thin film sensors in Cardiff. When UWIST and UCC merged in 1988 the Wolfson Centre became part of the School of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, which later became the Cardiff School of Engineering. The Centre later moved to its present location in purpose built laboratories in the Queen's Buildings on Newport Road, which was part of a ¬£30 million refurbishment of Engineering and Science buildings at Cardiff University. Professor Thompson retired in 1990 and Professor Moses became the new Director. In 1994 the WCM was designated a Centre of Expertise by the Welsh Development Agency. The Wolfson Centre hosted another major international conference, the International Symposium on Non-Linear Electromagnetics (ISEM) in 1995. In 1999, major government funding of ¬£1.3 million under the Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) was awarded to the Wolfson Centre to expand and improve facilities and enable the Wolfson Centre research staff to carry out cutting-edge magnetics research into the next decade. Prof. A.J. Moses (first from the left) and Queen Elizabeth II (second from the right) In 2000 Queen Elizabeth II visited Cardiff University and also saw some activity of the WCM. In 2001 the Wolfson Centre hosted the first UK Joint Magnetics Workshop (JMW) of the new millennium and was approved as one of 20 Centres of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration (CETIC) within Wales. The formal opening of new Wolfson Centre facilities established as a result of the ¬£1.3 million investment awarded under the Joint Infrastructure Fund took place in January 2003. In 1995, the WCM hosted the ISEM Conference on its first visit to Europe. On 14 May 2003 Prof. A.J. Moses was awarded an honorary degree - Doctor Honoris Causa by the Lublin University of Technology (LUT), Poland. This was partially a part of recognition of the strong cooperation between LUT, other Polish Institutes and WCM, which started in 1985. In June 2004 the Wolfson Centre was host to the Fifth European Magnetic Sensors and Actuators Conference (EMSA). In August 2005 Professor David Jiles was appointed as the new Director and the name of the Centre was changed to its current form Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to better reflect the range of activities being undertaken within the Centre, which includes not only magnetics technology but also basic scientific aspects of magnetics. In 2005-2006 the WCM was awarded a Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF) (¬£1.5 million). Present and future WCM is a multinational centre and its members come from various countries around the world: Bangladesh, Brazil, Burma, China, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, India, Iraq, Japan, Lebanon, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, UK, Ukraine, Thailand and United States. Cardiff University plans a further major expansion of the WCM to increase the number of faculty working in magnetics and to continue the improvement of the existing research facilities. The expansion will focus on aspects of magnetics related to energy, healthcare, nanoscale magnetics, sensors. These include: bulk hard magnetic materials, high frequency materials, low-dimensional materials (micro and nano), nanoscale magnetic structures, magnetic non-destructive evaluation methods, and biomedical applications of magnetics. On completion the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics will be one of the largest and best-equipped research centres in magnetics in Europe. In 2007 the WCM was the host for the Soft Magnetic Materials Conference (SMM18) and in 2008 will be for 1&2DM Workshop. People During its existence over 150 higher degrees were awarded on basis of research carried out in WCM.

He was the son of Vyacheslav Yaroslavich, Prince of Smolensk. Following his father's death in 1057, the child Boris was debarred from his inheritance. He died fighting against his unclesVsevolod Yaroslavich, Prince of Chernigov and Izyaslav Yaroslavich, Grand Prince of Kievon 3 October 1078.  Early life  Boris was the son of Vyacheslav Yaroslavich, Prince of Smolensk, a younger son of Yaroslav the Wise, Grand Prince of Kiev. According to the historian Martin Dimnik, Boris was a child when his father died in 1057. Boris became an izgoia member of the Rurik dynasty debarred from rulingafter his father's death, because his uncle, Igor Yaroslavich succeeded his father in Smolensk. Boris's allegedly close relationship with his cousins, Oleg Svyatoslavich and Roman Svyatoslavich implies that their father, Sviatoslav Iaroslavich, Prince of Chernigov appeased Boris \\"in some manner, undoubtedly, by giving him a town\\", according to Martin.  In Chernigov  Principalities in the Kievan Rus' (1054-1132) Upon the death of Sviatoslav Yaroslavich in 1077, his brothers Vsevolod Yaroslavich and Izyaslav Yaroslavich started a bitter rivalry over the Kievan throne. Vsevolod left Chernigov and headed towards Izyaslav, who had set out on a military campaign against Kiev. Boris took advantage of his uncle's absence and seized control of Chernigov. He only managed to remain in power for eight days and then had to flee to Tmutarakan upon hearing the news of Vsevolod's return.  In Tmutarakan  In Tmutarakan, Boris was accepted by his cousin, Prince Roman Svyatoslavich. The two were soon joined by Roman's brother, Oleg, who had been banished by his uncles from the Principality of Vladimir. Boris and Oleg allied themselves with the Cumans and attacked Vsevolod on the Sozh River, defeating his army in a bloody battle and capturing Chernigov on 25 August 1078. Soon, Vsevolod and Izyaslav were able to muster a new army with the help of their sons and headed for Chernigov. Boris and Oleg had already left the city by the time Vsevolod and Izyaslav approached it, but the citizens of Chernigov closed the gates and prepared for the siege. The attackers burned the outer parts of the city and wanted to proceed further, but received the news on Oleg and Boris coming to Chernigov's rescue.

Life  He received his first lessons in drawing, modelling and carving wood from his father, the painter Christian Carl Magnussen. In 1882, he began his formal training in Munich with Nikolaus Gysis, Gabriel von Hackl and Ludwig von L√∂fftz. Despite being in Munich, he was most impressed by works from the Berliner Bildhauerschule (Berlin School of Sculpture) and went there in 1888, where he obtained a position in the studios of Reinhold Begas, remaining for five years. In 1889, he produced a bust of Otto von Bismarck that sold over 1,000 copies in plaster and bronze over the next ten years. He became a free-lance sculptor in 1893 and entered several competitions for contracts, but with little success. In 1899, his smaller works attracted the attention of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who commissioned him to do a figure of the dying Frederick the Great. This finally brought him to public attention and he was awarded one of the coveted commissions for Wilhelm's ambitious Siegesallee project. His work on that project earned him the Order of the Crown, Class IV. He committed suicide by asphyxiation with gas.

He is the father of Bartosz Iwan. Career Club He made first steps on a long football career in Wanda Krak√≥w, but in 1976 he moved to Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w where he entered professional football, contributing a great deal to the title in 1978. He played 198 games and scored 69 goals for Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, before he was transferred to G√≥rnik Zabrze. In next two years he proved to be a key player for a new team, a dominant force in the middle of 80s in Polish football. As he started career as a striker, he experienced transformation in G√≥rnik Zabrze into a playmaker. He spent the last years of his professional career abroad (VfL Bochum, Aris Saloniki) punctuated by short returns to G√≥rnik Zabrze. He won four Polish Championships (Wis≈Ça and G√≥rnik) and ended up with 226 games and 90 goals in the Polish League. Additionally, he participated in 17 games in European club competitions and scored four goals. International He made his debut in the Polish national team in the second game of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, against Tunisia, at the age of 18. Four years later he became a first team player in the 1982 FIFA World Cup until injury in the second game ruled him out from the next games. He gave up the international career in 1987 with 11 goals in 29 matches. Coaching and television On his retirement as a player, Iwan embarked on a coaching profession, for the first few years with a junior team in Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, leading him to the assistant position of the first team between 1999 and 2001 (Adam Nawa≈Çka followed by duet Orest Lenczyk and Waldemar Fornalik). In Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin he was again as assistant to Adam Nawa≈Çka, however, they were released only after five months of working. In 2003, Iwan leaped at the opportunity to lead a team, fourth league club Okocimski KS Brzesko. He worked there for two years until his dismissal in 2005, after a series of defeats. Prior to that, Okocimski Brzesko had been close to promotion in 2004, but lost in the final matches of playoff to Kmita Zabierz√≥w. Iwan managed two more teams, P≈Çomien Jerzmanowice (fifth league, 2005‚Äì06) and Wiatra Lud≈∫mierz (junior team, 2006) until his coaching career was finally brought to a close.

In the east heights of more than 900 metres (3,000 ft) are attained in the Ennedi and Ouadda√Ø plateaus. The greatest elevations are reached in the Tibesti Mountains in the north, with a maximum height of 3,415 metres (11,204 ft) at Emi Koussi. The northern half of the republic lies in the Sahara. The Bod√©l√© Depression is a low region in the southern Sahara that is surrounded by basalt mountain ridges. Winds flow through this region and lift dust. The dust from this region supplies over half of the dust to Amazon rainforests. The only important rivers, the Logone and Chari, are located in the southwest and flow into Lake Chad. The lake doubles in size during the rainy season. Geology The geology of Chad includes an area of metamorphic rocks of Precambrian age surrounding the Chad Basin which is floored with Tertiary and Quaternary sediments. There are Precambrian rocks in the Tibesti Mountains in the north and the east whilst in eastern Chad are basement rocks, some of which extend into Darfur in neighbouring Sudan. Granitic gneiss and pelitic-graphitic schists are widespread. These are commonly cut by late orogenic granites and pegmatites. Within the Kufra Basin in the northeast are lower Palaeozoic sandstones which are overlain by Nubian Sandstones. There are also continental clastic rocks of lower Cretaceous age and rocks of marine origin from the Upper Cretaceous. Within the Chad Basin, the Neogene Chad Formation is composed of lacustrine sediments. Economic geology There is at present no significant mineral industry. Though present, gold, salt and soda ash have yet to be worked on any commercially significant basis. Exploration for both crude oil and uranium has been undertaken by international companies.Chad Geology, The Extractive Industries Source Book , accessed 13 April 2013  References  External links Chad Geography of Chad ","title":"Geology of Chad"},{"id":"6450301","text":"Top: Lateral view; the red circles mark the front air dam/splitter and rear diffuser. Bottom: Underbody view. A diffuser, in an automotive context, is a shaped section of the car underbody which improves the car's aerodynamic properties by enhancing the transition between the high-velocity airflow underneath the car and the much slower freestream airflow of the ambient atmosphere. It works by providing a space for the underbody airflow to decelerate and expand (in volume, as density is assumed to be constant at the speeds that cars travel) so that it does not cause excessive flow separation and drag, by providing a degree of \\"wake infill\\" or more accurately, pressure recovery. The diffuser itself accelerates the flow in front of it, which helps generate downforce. This is achieved by creating a change in velocity of the air flowing under the diffuser by giving it a rake angle which in turn generates a change in pressure and hence increases downforce. __TOC__ Overview When a diffuser is used, the air flows into the underbody from the front of the car, accelerates and reduces pressure. There is a suction peak at the transition of the flat bottom and diffuser. This transition is where the lowest pressure generally is located and is called the throat of the diffuser. The diffuser then eases this high velocity air back to normal velocity and also helps fill in the area behind the car making the whole underbody a more efficient downforce producing device by reducing drag on the car. The diffuser also imparts upward momentum to the air which further increases downforce. The trailing or leading edge of a diffuser may receive a nolder‚Äîa precise small lip, protuberance or wing to enhance its performance. Operation (rear diffuser)  The aft part of a car underbody is where a rear diffuser is usually located. It works by accelerating the velocity of the airflow underneath the car. At the diffuser exit station the air flow is at the same pressure and speed of the ambient, since its geometry is expanding the rear region the exit area is much bigger than the inlet, therefore for the conservation of mass principle the air flow will have a much bigger speed at the diffuser inlet and as a consequence on the whole car underbody. The consequence of the increase flow speed is a reduction in pressure according to the Bernoulli's principle . Since the pressure below the car is lower than on the side and above the car, downforce is produced if implemented correctly. Front diffusers also exist (especially on Le Mans Prototypes or similar cars); however, they generate downforce purely from momentum exchange with the air, as there is nothing ahead of them to drive. A poorly designed front diffuser can create a low pressure region toward the front of the car which slows the air behind it down and reduces the effectiveness of the rest of the underbody. Front diffusers usually route air away from the car so that it doesn't affect the rest of the underbody. The air can be vented through a channel or expelled near the front wheels. Injecting the exhaust into the rear diffuser can also help extract the air from below the car. The exhaust gasses effectively energize the boundary layer, helping to raise the pressure of the low- pressure, fast-moving airstream back to the ambient atmospheric pressure at the exit of the diffuser. This fast-moving air helps evacuate the diffuser more quickly, which helps drop the pressure at the underbody. However, this makes the diffuser rather sensitive to engine speed. When the driver lifts off the throttle, the exhaust flow is greatly reduced, which makes the diffuser less effective, robbing the vehicle of downforce. Thus, handling is negatively affected. The car's bodywork also interacts with the flow through the diffuser. In addition to creating downforce, the front wing and nose try to keep \\"clean air\\" flowing around, and more importantly under, the car. Clean air under the car prevents flow separation from occurring in the diffuser, which would severely rob its performance. The rear wing also affects the diffuser. When the wing is mounted low and close to the diffuser, the low pressure under the wing helps suck air through the diffuser. Cars, such as the Toyota Eagle MkIII and the Jaguar XJR-14 employed two-tier wings to enhance this effect. One profile was mounted high, in order to hit relatively clean air. The other profile was mounted almost flush with the bodywork behind the chassis. This wing's profile is used to drive the diffuser, creating that low pressure area to help move air from the underbody. According to Hiro Fujimori, aerodynamicist for the Toyota Eagle MkIII project, this bi-plane wing produced 18% more downforce for the same drag as a normal wing.Mulsanne's Corner: Hiro Fujimori on the Toyota Eagle MkIII Conversely, equal downforce levels could be attained for significantly reduced drag with this \\"Red Baron\\" wing. Multi- deck diffusers In 2009, the Formula 1 grid was embroiled in controversy. The culprit was the so-called double-decker diffuser introduced at first by Brawn GP, WilliamsF1, and Toyota Racing, but later put into use by every team. These three teams had exploited a loophole in the rules that allowed for more volume in the diffuser. The rules stated that the diffuser must start at a point aligned with the centerline of the rear wheels. The loophole allowed for holes in the underbody, perpendicular to the reference plane (not visible as a hole when viewed from directly above), that fed a diffuser channel that was above the main diffuser. This greatly increased the available downforce, and was worth about half a second per lap, according to Mike Gascoyne.BBC Sport: The row that has split F1 The teams decided to allow the double-decker diffusers again for 2010. However, for 2011, the Formula 1 Technical Working Group decided to ban multi-deck diffusers. Splitters Porsche RS Spyder Evo uses a front splitter combined with dive planes As the front of the car slows down the air without a diffuser, this is the ideal place for an inlet. A splitter is commonly used here, serving to increase the amount of downforce at the front of the car. The airstream is brought to stagnation above the splitter by an air dam, causing an area of high pressure. Below the splitter, the air is redirected away from the stagnation zone and is accelerated, causing the pressure to drop. This, combined with the high pressure over the splitter, creates downforce. The larger the area of the splitter, the more downforce is generated. In most closed-wheel race cars, the underside of the splitter smoothly integrates with the undertray, creating one large flat plane that is driven by the rear diffuser. Some race cars, such as the Toyota GT- One, actually use an additional diffuser immediately behind the splitter to help create more downforce.Mulsanne's Corner: Front Diffuser profile on Toyota GT-One The air extracted by this diffuser is exhausted through vents in the sidepods or above the car around the cockpit.

The report created a large amount of controversy when it was published, as one of its conclusions was that much of the blame for growing spiritual and economic poverty in British inner cities was due to Thatcherite policies. Origin of the report According to the report's authors, the archbishop's special commission was established with the following aim: > To examine the strengths, insights, problems and needs of the Church's life > and mission in Urban Priority Areas and, as a result, to reflect on the > challenge which God may be making to Church and Nation: and to make > recommendations to appropriate bodies. Report recommendations The report made 61 recommendations: 38 of them to the Church of England, and 23 to the government and nation. The church was asked to identify its \\"urban priority area\\" parishes, according to Department for the Environment indicators relating to 1981 census data. The six indicators were: levels of unemployment, overcrowding, households lacking basic amenities, pensioners living alone, ethnic origin, and single parent households. It was to pay attention to clergy staffing levels; to adequate training programmes for ordained and lay leaders; to liturgical needs; to styles of work with children and young people; to the use of its buildings. It was also to look at its work in industrial mission, social services, social responsibility, church schools and education. The Recommendations to Government and Nation were specific ‚Äì taking in the Rate Support Grant, the Urban Programme, levels of overtime working, Community Programmes, Supplementary Benefit, Child Benefit, the taxation system, ethnic records and housing availability and allocation, homelessness, \\"care in the community\\", Law Centres and law enforcement. Reaction and legacy When the report was published it caused immediate controversy. An unnamed Conservative Cabinet Minister was reported as dismissing the report ‚Äì before it was published ‚Äì as \\"pure Marxist theology\\" and another Conservative MP claimed the report proved that the Anglican church was governed by a \\"load of Communist clerics\\". Margaret Thatcher, a Methodist, told her friend Woodrow Wyatt that \\"There's nothing about self-help or doing anything for yourself in the report\\" and lamented that the report focused on state action. According to the late Bishop of Liverpool, David Sheppard, although the report was loudly \\"rubbished\\" by some senior Conservative politicians, these attacks had the benefit of making \\"Faith in the City famous\\". The Chief Rabbi of Britain, Immanuel Jakobovits, published a response to the report titled From Doom to Hope: A Jewish view of \\"Faith in the City\\". Jakobovits argued that the Jewish contribution to eradicating poverty \\"would lay greater emphasis on building up self-respect by encouraging ambition and enterprise through a more demanding and more satisfying work-ethic, which is designed to eliminate human idleness and to nurture pride in 'eating the toil of one's hands' as the first immediate targets\\". Jakobovits also said blacks should not look to the state but instead to themselves and take responsibility for their poverty. He argued that they should learn from the Jewish experience of working themselves out of poverty, educating themselves and building up a \\"trust in and respect for the police, realising that our security as a minority depended on law and order being maintained\\". The report triggered extensive public and media debate regarding Thatcherite ethics, urban decay, the modern role and relevance of the church, and the perceived growing divide between rich and poor in 1980s Britain. One of the most visible legacies of the report followed its recommendation number 25, which stated \\"A Church Urban Fund should be established to strengthen the Church's presence and promote the Christian witness in the urban priority areas.\\" The Church of England created this fund in 1988, subsequently raising and distributing more than ¬£55 million to faith-related initiatives across the country. According to George Cassidy, Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, in a speech to the House of Lords, a less immediately obvious legacy of the Faith in the City report can also be ascertained. He opined that, although the report focused on urban areas, the message of the report \\"was, and to a great extent remains, universal\\" ‚Äì prompting the Church of England to make similar work in looking at problems in non urban areas. The successful model for links, dialogue and cooperation between faith organisations and urban local communities in the wake of the report and the establishment of the Church Urban Fund were mirrored later in rural areas, following the recommendations in the subsequent report, Faith in the Countryside. According to the bishop, in the same speech, this A tribute to the positive results of the Faith in the City report was also provided by the Dean of Norwich, Graham Smith, in a civic service in June 2005: > At one level it provided the churches of the inner city with a voice, and > the voice was to articulate what was being felt and experienced by some of > the poorest and most dis-advantaged communities in Britain ... Faith in the > City began a movement which was partly political (with a small p), partly > theological and partly spiritual.

It was founded in 1836. History of the Society The CPAS was founded in 1836 in the midst of the social upheaval of the Industrial Revolution to take 'the gospel to every man‚Äôs door, with a single eye to the glory of God'., About CPAS - History. Its founders included the prominent social reformer Lord Shaftesbury., About CPAS - History. It initially sought to fulfil its vision by giving grants to poorest parishes to enable them to take on extra help. One early recipient of such a grant was Haworth, which enabled its minister, Patrick Bront√´, to employ a curate, Arthur Nicholls, who later married Patrick's daughter, Charlotte., About CPAS - History. Charlotte summarised and praised the early work of the CPAS in the opening of her 1846 novel Shirley: \\"Of late years, I say, an abundant shower of curates has fallen upon the north of England, but in eighteen-hundred-eleven-twelve that affluent rain had not descended. Curates were scarce then: there was no Pastoral Aid - no Additional Curates' Society to stretch a helping hand to worn-out old rectors and incumbents, and give them the wherewithal to pay a vigorous young colleague from Oxford or Cambridge.\\", About CPAS - History. While the CPAS has since diversified in its methods, which now notably include its holidays for young people, it retains its original vision of \\"enabl[ing] churches to help every person hear and discover the good news of Jesus Christ.\\" Work of the Society The CPAS works with churches across Ireland and the United Kingdom. Its aim is to \\"enable churches to help every person hear and discover the good news of Jesus\\". Its activities include the Growing Leaders suite of resources, the Arrow Leadership Programme, weekends, and a range of events and resources for youth and children's leaders. CPAS is responsible for Ventures and Falcon Camps, which are holidays for 8-18s. Falcon Camps are subsidised holidays for young people who might not otherwise be able to go on holiday. CPAS also has responsibility (sole or shared) for 512 patronages of Anglican churches up and down the country, and seeks to fill vacant incumbency posts with evangelical leaders. There is a head office team who develop and deliver tools, training and resources for churches. The general director is Rev John Dunnett. Their records are held at the University of Birmingham Special Collections. Quotes about the Society The following comments were made on 180th anniversary of the foundation of the CPAS: * \\"CPAS has a wonderful track record since 1836 of serving local parish churches and of working with their leaders to enable the church to share the Christian faith in our land\\": Andrew Watson, Bishop of Guildford * \\"I hear story after story of how CPAS has energised and enabled the witness of local church leaders and the churches to which they belong\\": Mike Hill, Bishop of Bristol * \\"There are very few mission organisations who have managed to impact the Church of England to the same degree as CPAS\\": Paul Williams, Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham Notes External links * Church of England societies and organisations Christian missionary societies Christian charities based in the United Kingdom Church of England missionary societies Church of England missions Christian missions Anglican organizations 1836 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Church Pastoral Aid Society"},{"id":"6450437","text":"The Dakin Building is an architectural award-winning class A office building on the San Francisco Bay in Brisbane, California. Serving as a corporate headquarters building for several companies of national prominence, it was built from the profits of the Garfield character whose licensed products of the R. Dakin Company soared in sales in the late 1980s. Located on Sierra Point, it became a landmark in the San Francisco Bay Area for its distinctive design and was nicknamed the Luke Skywalker building for its dramatic posture overlooking the bay, in contrast to a neighboring office building with a dark, ominous appearance that was nicknamed the Darth Vader building. Ownership and history Southwestern facade of the Dakin Building, as seen from adjacent parking lot on a sunny spring afternoon in 2007. The prominent awning/window system was removed during a remodel which completed in 2016. The Dakin Building was constructed in 1986 under commission of the R. Dakin Company, one of the largest manufacturers of plush products (mainly teddy bears) in the United States at that time. Dakin was in a large upswing of sales and profits in the late 1980s fueled by success of its Garfield character licenses, and needed to accommodate its burgeoning staff of artists and designers. Not long after completion of the building, several of the company founding key executives were killed in a light aircraft accident. In a financial and sales tailspin, the R. Dakin Company proceeded to sell this headquarters building to C. Michael Hogan, president of Earth Metrics Inc., an environmental research and consulting firm. Earth Metrics then moved into two floors of the building, as Dakin compressed its operations. At Dakin's request, The Good Guys! were secured as a major tenant in 1992, and the new owner performed substantial tenant improvements of approximately $1,300,000, upgrading the computer room infrastructure and building an auditorium. Foster Enterprises purchased the entire holding in 1995. Foster Enterprises is the successor entity of T. Jack Foster, a wealthy real estate magnate, for whom Foster City, California is named, since Foster owned and developed most of that San Francisco Peninsula city of population around 30,000. The Dakin Building and an adjoining building at 5000 Marina were sold in December 2005. The current tenant is Sangamo Therapeutics, who announced they would move to the site in 2017. Prior to Sangamo, the building served as the headquarters of Walmart Global eCommerce from approximately 2000 until 2010, when the eCommerce headquarters moved to San Bruno. The property is owned by Westport Capital Partners, managed by CBRE Group, and marketed as Marina Landing alongside the neighboring building at 5000 Marina Blvd. 5000 Marina is leased to Ultragenyx. Role during Glasnost During the Glasnost period, the Dakin building was a primary location central to development of relationships between Russians (then Soviet citizens) and Americans. Philanthropist Henry Dakin, chairman of the Dakin Company, was the catalyst in bringing numerous parties together from the Soviet Union and United States. As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle:\\"Cyberspace\\", San Francisco Chronicle, Page A-14, November 20, 1995 \\"During the late 1980s, as glasnost and perestroika led to the liquidation of the Soviet empire, the Dakin building was the location for a series of groups facilitating United States-Russian contacts. They included the Center for U.S.-U.S.S.R. Initiatives, which helped more than 1000 Americans visit the Soviet Union and more than 400 then-Soviet citizens visit the U.S.\\" Siting and physical design Looking northwest from the Dakin Building campus over San Francisco Bay toward San Bruno Mountain. This arm of the bay is the location where Humphrey the whale was rescued. The building is situated on a San Francisco Bay shoreline frontage parcel with almost of bay frontage. From above, the building plan resembles an isoceles right triangle; the base of the triangle faces the bayfront to the north and has the large glass atrium protruding from its center, and the equal-length sides face to the southwest and southeast. The circular penthouse is near the apex formed by the two equal-length sides. The parcel at Sierra Point has a commanding view of the central portion of the San Francisco Bay, the city of San Francisco, San Bruno Mountain and Candlestick Park. The Dakin Building is close to the Sierra Point Marina and lies about north of San Francisco International Airport. Aerial view facing west-northwest (2016); San Bruno Mountain rises immediately to the west of the square-shaped Sierra Point; the Dakin Building can be seen on the northern (right) edge of the artificial peninsula. The underlying site was constructed from bay fill activities from 1965 to 1985, mostly consisting of construction debris from San Francisco. Aerial photographs prior to 1965 show this area to be tidelands of the San Francisco Bay. A clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval.Paul B. Awosika and Marc Papineau, Phase One Environmental Site Assessment, 7000 Marina Boulevard, Brisbane, California, Certified. Engineering & Testing Company, Boston, Massachusetts, July 15, 1993 The Dakin building was built over thick bay mud formations that were expected to subside up to by the year 2006; therefore, the main entrance ramp was built on a giant hinge to allow the earth to settle, while the building, resting on driven piles, remains stationary. The year 2006 has arrived, and indeed the flexibility in the ramp allowed the building to effectively \\"rise\\" above the land around it. However, the subsidence undermined the safety of the ramps causing structural damage to the concrete and opening up small crevice-like cracks in its connective fabric. Their angle eventually violated city regulations for disabled-person access and in October 2006, the ramps were replaced with a composite design of stairs, disabled- access lift, and switchback ramps. Architecture The building was designed by the well-known architectural firm Munselle Brown Partnership Inc. of San Francisco (now Costa Brown Architecture), who were selected after winning an invited design competition, and Architects of Record, DES Architects + Engineers, Inc. as a Class A office building. Peter Munselle of the Munselle Brown Partnership prepared the winning architectural design concept. Theodore Brown served as Partner in Charge for Munselle/Brown, and Bob Giannini was the principal architect for DES. The building was completed in 1986, commissioned by the Dakin Company, being constructed by the Koll company. It is entirely steel frame in construction, supported by driven piles up to deep into the bay mud. A dedicated trail for hikers is established to conform to the San Francisco Bay perimeter master trail plan; large boulders and rip-rap are placed below the trail to prevent wave action erosion. The landscape architect for the original design was Royston, Hanamoto, Alley and Abey of San Francisco. The building itself is a five-story design plus a penthouse, with one subterranean parking level. The exterior features a skin that is an innovative all porcelain panel design, giving the building a shimmering appearance in the sunlight or uplights by night; moreover most of the fenestration was slanted approximately 45 degrees from vertical, designed to reduce glare and enhance energy conservation, but also lending a futuristic effect. In 2014, Westport Capital, the owner of the site (including 5000 Marina and the Dakin Building at 7000 Marina), applied for a permit to redesign the Dakin, presenting their preliminary plans in April 2014. The remodeling of 5000 and 7000 Marina was handled by Design Blitz SF. At the time, both buildings had been vacant for more than four years. Design Permit DP-2-14 was approved by the City of Brisbane Planning Commission on August 7, 2014 by a vote of 3‚Äì1; it was intended to link the two buildings together with a cohesive design. Key elements of the redesign of the Dakin included removing the signature angled window/awning system, replacing them with vertical glass, and to square-off the glass entry at the building's southern corner. Two members of the Brisbane City Council filed an appeal of the approval two weeks later. According to the appeal, \\"[n]either the Planning Staff nor the Planning Commission demonstrated an awareness of the historical and architectural significance of what was originally known as the Dakin Building. The Brisbane City Council commissioned NicholsBooth Architects to review the proposed design, who concluded that \\"if we subscribe to the belief that form follows function, then we recommend changing this form to create the desired function\\" in recommending the proposed modification to the window/awning system be approved. It was also noted the existing window/awning system blocked views for most building occupants and were leaky. At a subsequent special public meeting, Theodore Brown, the original architect, shared his vision for the building and suggested alternatives to the proposed redesign, but the Council affirmed the Planning Commission's decision 3‚Äì2. The remodel was completed in 2016. The gross floor area is approximately plus of underground parking and shipping /receiving rooms.Dale H. Duffy and Kendall W. Rice, Level One Environmental Site Assessment, 7000 Marina Boulevard, Brisbane, California, prepared by E2C Inc., Sunnyvale, California for C.M. Hogan, November 28, 1990 Surface parking is provided for 266 vehicles. In 2018, Marina Boulevard Property (the corporate entity spun off from Westport Capital) applied to reduce the number of parking spots to 245 to upgrade the utility service to the building, required by the building's new role as a research & development center. Due to its proximity to landfill, the Dakin relies on specially engineered recovery systems below its basements to actively capture fugitive methane off-gas and vent it away from the building. Interior The interior design features a soaring five-story entrance atrium capped by a massive skylight dome with a laminated glass glazing panel, whose atrium footprint is almost . Other major interior elements are a state-of-the-art auditorium and a large computer room capable of supporting a national corporation data center, both built by C. Michael Hogan, the second owner. At the Christmas season the building was historically topped with several illuminated stars approximately each in area, emulating a Brisbane annual tradition of lighted stars on buildings. Artworks In the late 1980s the R. Dakin Company assembled a large collection of contemporary art from artists worldwide. The media included watercolor, oil painting, serigraph, lithograph, etching, collage, ceramic plate, sculpture and mixed media. These pieces were used to grace the interior of the Dakin Building, and were hung in literally all public areas, conference rooms, hallways and the atrium. The collection featured some well-known artists and some rising artists, who were not well established at that time. Some of the artists featured are Jeff Glenn, tapestry artist; Barbe; Marachal; Heiliger; Marlatt; Frings; Dudley and Garber. When C. Michael Hogan purchased the building in 1990, he hung some of his art collection to add to the museum character of the building, including a well-known suite of Roberto Matta. When Dakin left the building, Hogan purchased the bulk of the Dakin art collection. The front exterior entrance to the Dakin building originally featured a large stone sculpture of a teddy bear, hewn from natural stone. This bear became the hallmark of the high-tech building embodying the playful spirit of the R. Dakin designers and the avant- garde character of the building. The bear is designed in the manner of Benny Bufano by sculptor Judith Lord. When Hogan sold the Dakin Building in 1995, he retained ownership rights to the bear. In 2018, Sangamo presented plans to install a dichroic glass and stainless steel sculpture near the northern atrium. The sculpture, a sphere approximately in diameter, is entitled Eureka and was created by the artist Gordon Huether. The Star Wars saga Hitachi Building at 1000 Marina Blvd, located near to Dakin Building The Dakin building has been nicknamed the 'Luke Skywalker' building, due to its bold appearance of bright white porcelain panels and futuristic design, seeming to embody the concept of good. To complete the metaphor, the nearby Hitachi Building is dubbed the 'Darth Vader' building, replete with its full reflective exterior of black smoke glass, emulating the impenetrable visage of the evil counterpart. The San Francisco Chronicle stated \\"Aesthetically [the Darth Vader building] is no match for Luke Skywalker's happy white palace just a few hundred feet away, which has been an instant popular success. The newly completed building is headquarters for the R. Dakin cuddly toy company.\\" According to the Chronicle article, \\"The differences between the two buildings go far beyond ... architectural good versus evil. They show the choice between prepackaged architecture, in which individuals or even businesses are regarded as interchangeable, and a custom built home for a family controlled company that has been in the Bay Area for years.\\" Hitachi relocated from the dark glass building to a site on North First Street in San Jose in 2007. The property was acquired by Meridian Property Company from TA Associates in 2016 for $29 million and sold to Phase 3 Real Estate Partners in 2018 for $39.5 million. Awards Northern facade of the Dakin Building, viewed from the San Francisco Bay Shoreline Trail. The large glass atrium is prominent on the right-hand side of the photograph. The Dakin building has won a number of architectural awards including an American Institute of Architects Design Excellence Award in 1992. According to the San Francisco Examiner, the jury awarded this distinction to the Dakin building because \\"[i]ts chief strength is the atrium, with its views of the San Francisco Bay and asymmetrical skylight\\". The same article noted the building \\"houses executive offices, research and development facilities and product showrooms\\". In international design competition the Dakin building was awarded semi-finalist standing in the 1990 Quaternario Award, an international award for innovative technology in architecture. The American Institute of Architects 1990 article states that one of the bases for the international recognition is: ‚ÄúThe two north facing atrium walls are faced entirely in glass... Due to the expanse of glass, the projecting atrium gives the impression of a greenhouse, creating the effect of extending the interior to an adjacent park and to the bay beyond‚Äù. The Quaternario judges focused on the technological aspects of the fenestration design where window angles were calculated to minimize interior glare and reduce interior over-illumination, while at the same time reducing solar heat loading and subsequent demand for air conditioning as energy conservation techniques. The angled window projections effectively provide permanent sunscreens, obviating any need for interior blinds or shades.

Plot summary Picking up two years onwards from the end of Designated Targets, Final Impact is the last novel in the Axis of Time trilogy. The supercarrier Hillary Clinton has been refurbished with more conventional steam catapults which replaced her less reliable fuel air explosive catapults. Her carrier air group is replenished with A-4 Skyhawk jet-powered attack aircraft, many of which are flown by 'temps, contemporary pilots. Admiral Kolhammer returns to sea at the head of a new Task Force with the Clinton at its core after two years of administering the Special Administrative Zone-California. Many characters have died in the intervening time period, from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, by his own hand to Commander Dan Black, one of the main characters of the story who asks for a return to combat and dies during the re-takeover of Hawaii, when his plane crashed during take-off from Muroc Airfield, California. D-Day is launched on May 3 of 1944, a month earlier than in the original timeline. The Allies invade the Pas-de-Calais instead of Normandy, relying on a dis-information campaign to obtain surprise. They are able to gain a foothold and slowly push back the Nazi forces. On May 27, the Allies gain a major victory by wiping out several German divisions with massed air strikes. On June 1, the USSR rejoins the Allied side and declares war against the Axis: They launch a huge attack against Germany and advance on a broad front. The Soviets have used the intervening two years to build up their armed forces, and construct fleet of warships at Vladivostok. Meanwhile, Paul Brasch's cover is blown and he is extracted by British commandos. Adolf Hitler has a seizure and suffers permanent brain and muscle damage; with the T4 program in mind, Heinrich Himmler chooses to suffocate him. Before launching an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands, the Soviets drop an atomic bomb on Litzmannstadt (that is, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland). The Axis powers react as much as they can: Himmler authorizes the use of anthrax in an synthesized form which will persist for months. He also orders the Army to begin transferring divisions from the western front to the east, gradually bringing the Soviet advance to a halt. The USSR takes two more blows when a massive kamikaze strike cripples their Pacific Fleet, and the A-bomb building facility in Kamchatka is destroyed - both hits scored by the Japanese. The United States has secretly completed the Manhattan Project a few months earlier, with the help of thousands of people from the future Multi-National force. They now have a large enough stockpile of bombs to take on Germany, Japan and the USSR at the same time, if necessary. On the orders of President Roosevelt, a trio of B-52 bombers fly out of New Mexico and launch a raid deep into Germany. Berlin is utterly destroyed with three nuclear weapons. In response to the U.S. blast on Berlin and the Japanese destroying the Soviet Pacific fleet at Kamchatka, the Soviets destroy Tokyo with an atomic bomb, killing the Emperor. The Axis Powers give in to unconditional surrender, ending the war in June 1944, but the damage has been done. The USSR has pushed into Asia securing gains in Persia, Afghanistan, Korea, Indochina and is probably going to share occupation of Japan with U.S. and Australia; in Europe the USSR has gone around Germany and has taken all of Eastern Europe including Greece, plus Northern Italy and chunks of Vichy France and Austria. The Western Allies are at odds with the Soviet Union, and the stage is set for another cold war. With the Axis defeated, most of the main characters move into the private sector and start anew.

The new bridge  Foundation plaque, 1927, Newport Bridge, Newport In 1911 the Town Council sought designs for a new replacement bridge. In December 1923 a decision was made to proceed immediately with the construction of the new bridge, partly as a scheme to find work for the unemployed. To best achieve this a temporary wooden bridge was erected alongside it and all power and gas lines were re-routed onto it. Even the town's tram lines and their accompanying overhead power system were moved over. The old bridge was then demolished and the new one erected. On 22 June 1927 the new bridge was complete and opened to traffic by the Transport Minister Wilfrid Ashley.  The stone cherubs  Cherub and shield on Newport Bridge On four of its pillars the new bridge has a stone cherub, painted in gold, and shield, modelled after the coat of arms of Newport. In 1994 John Squire, guitarist of The Stone Roses, designed the cover of the band's single \\"Love Spreads\\", basing it on a photograph of a stone cherub and shield on Newport Bridge. The song was the band's biggest selling single, reaching number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. The cherub design found its way onto many pieces of merchandise for Second Coming, the album from which \\"Love Spreads\\" was taken.

The silent system evolved during the 1820s at Auburn Prison in Auburn, New York, as an alternative to and modification of the Pennsylvania system of solitary confinement, which it gradually replaced in the United States. Whigs favored this system because it promised to rehabilitate criminals by teaching them personal discipline and respect for work, property, and other people. Among notable elements of the Auburn system were striped uniforms, lockstep, and silence.  Prison life  Lockstep in the Auburn Prison During the 19th century, prisoners had no rights nor any opportunity to live semi-comfortably. The Auburn system established several characteristics that were unique to the world of disciplinary conditions. Silence was the biggest factor among rules for the prisoners. John D. Cray, a deputy warden at the Auburn Prison, demanded that prisoners be completely silent to take away the prisoners' \\"sense of self\\". When the \\"sense of self\\" was taken away, many convicts obeyed the warden's wishes. The second characteristic of the Auburn system was community activities. During regimented times during the day, prisoners had tasks to perform. Some of these included making \\"nails, barrels, clothing, shoes and boots, carpets, buttons, carpenters' tools, steam engines and boilers, combs, harnesses, furniture, brooms, clocks, buckets and pails, saddle trees...\\". During the 1840s, the prison began to produce silk using silk worms and trees. The Auburn correctional facility was the first prison to profit from prisoner labor. The prison had many sightseers in the 19th century. The goal of this system was to instill good work habits and ideas of industry that were supposed to be rehabilitative.  Lockstep and clothing  Elam Lynds, in association with John D. Cray, developed a revolutionary system of transporting convicts within the prison. The prisoners marched in unison, and locked their arms to the convict in front of them. The prisoners had to look to one side, and were not allowed to look at guards or other inmates. The clothing at the prison was a grayish material with horizontal stripes. Punishment In 1821 a new principal keeper, Elam Lynds, was appointed to run the prison. He believed in the disciplinary power of the lash, and used flogging to punish even minor infractions. In 1839 a prisoner died from neglect and over-flogging. The committee of Auburn and other staff members of the Auburn Theological Seminary petitioned to bring the issue of the punishments to the State government. \\"The law stated that six blows on the naked back with the 'cat' or six-stranded whip was the most punishment that could be assigned for any one offense.\\" In 1846 another meeting was congregated to abolish the use of whips. Flagellation could only be used for riots or severe cases. When whipping was prohibited, guards and keepers sought new ways to punish the disorderly. \\"The shower bath consisted of a barrel about 4¬Ω feet high with a discharge tube at the bottom. The prisoner was stripped naked, bound hand and foot, with a wooden collar around his neck to prevent him moving his head. The barrel, with the inmate inside, was placed directly under an outlet pipe, where water, sometimes iced, would pour down.\\" Another form of punishment was \\"the yoke\\". The yoke used iron bars around the neck and arms of the prisoners.  Women and the prison  In the early days of the prison, women inmates were held in the windowless attic atop the high security prison. They shared a single room and slept in the same area where they worked, primarily at \\"picking wool, knitting, and spooling.\\" In 1838 all women prisoners were transferred to the then-new female wing at Sing Sing. In 1892 the women returned to a new building at the Auburn prison. The Auburn Women's Prison remained in operation until 1933, when a new maximum-security wing for female inmates opened at Bedford Hills.

Further, he participated at the 1984 and at the 1988 Summer Olympics, where he won the bronze medal with the German team. Career A clinical striker in his prime, the son of a junk dealer started his career at the age of six at local side Eintracht Essen before he joined the youth ranks of Essen's biggest club, Rot- Weiss Essen, in 1972. Starting job training to become a florist, his mother owned a flower shop, Mill signed his first professional contract with Rot- Weiss in 1976. Essen was a Bundesliga side in his debut season, a campaign in which those three goals he banged in total 19 appearances couldn't avoid their drop down to 2. Bundesliga North. In that division he grew to a reliable hitman, scoring 71 goals for Rot-Weiss (at times alongside Horst Hrubesch) until the end of the 1981 season, forty of those just in his 38 appearances of 1979‚Äì80. A tally that identified him as the topscorer of 2. Bundesliga Nord and easily made him a chased starlet. A move to Borussia M√∂nchengladbach under manager Jupp Heynckes brought him back to top level Bundesliga in 1981. At M√∂nchengladbach he kept on scoring, netting fourteen in his first year under contract. Only eight months into his life at B√∂kelberg he got called up by Jupp Derwall to represent Germany for the first time in his career. On 21 March 1982, he featured in a friendly against Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. A back injury forced him out of contention for the West German squad for the 1982 FIFA World Cup tournament. The mentioned injury hampered his scoring spree slightly for just the then next season. During 1983‚Äì84 he was back on top of M√∂nchengladbach's scoring, firing nineteen goals past opposite goalkeepers in the Bundesliga. Missing out on the Bundesliga title with his club just on the final day and only on goal difference, the striker had to deal with a second major blow as M√∂nchengladbach also lost the DFB-Pokal final that summer, on penalties against Bayern Munich (with his Bayern Munich-bound team-mate Lothar Matth√§us failing to score from the spot in the shoot-out). Mill scored the only M√∂nchengladbach goal in normal time in that match. Later that summer he participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics and was still Borussia M√∂nchengladbach's best striker when fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund persuaded him to switch over to them at the end of the 1985‚Äì86 Bundesliga season. As M√∂nchengladbach was receiving adequate compensation (1.3 million DM) for his services, a transfer was worked out. Still, the move remained somewhat in the balance for a couple of weeks as troubled Dortmund had to go through three relegation play-offs that summer to ensure their Bundesliga future. Particularly Mill inspired Dortmund to a less troubled 1986‚Äì87 season, the striker's seventeen goals in thirty-one appearances in the Bundesliga that year helped Dortmund up to a fourth-place finish and a berth in the UEFA Cup the following season. His scoring punch made him a popular figure at Westfalenstadion immediately and subsequently earned him the role of team captain, outside his club he was part of the squad of the host nation at Euro 1988. Increasingly popular and seen as a role model, a disagreement over his captaincy and his role within the Dortmund squad between the chairman, Dr. Gerd Niebaum, and the team manager, Reinhard Saftig, resulted in a change of manager at the club with Saftig's successor, Horst K√∂ppel, leaving no doubt over him having the same point of view as the chairman regarding Mill's role for the club's first-team. Mill looked a bit out of form after K√∂ppel's take over, he had won bronze with Germany at the 1988 Summer Olympics in late summer 1988, and his once so impressive scoring quota faded. Still, he remained an important player for his club and was, kind of subsequently, part of the Dortmund team that lifted the DFB-Pokal trophy in 1989, beating bookie- favourites Werder Bremen in the final. At that time Mill was kind of an ageing marksman, but somehow still recognized by Franz Beckenbauer to still play a part in the German national football team and so he won a spot in the West German squad for the 1990 World Cup. A shrewd taker of any blunder an opponent was willing to concede inside the penalty-box, his reputation as one of the best strikers of his time helped 'Frankie' being part of the German squad there. With proven Rudi V√∂ller and youngsters J√ºrgen Klinsmann and Karlheinz Riedle all well in front of him in Beckenbauer's striker thoughts, Mill stayed the unused fourth-choice striker in those successful Italian weeks of German football. On club level his fading punch in front of the goal saw him going through a proper transformation from the scorer to the assist winner, but this couldn't stop him from getting more and more on the fringes of the Borussia Dortmund first-team. In 1991, K√∂ppel departed as manager and his successor at the helm of Dortmund's coaching, then fameless Ottmar Hitzfeld, started to set his stamp on the development of the club. With Stephane Chapuisat and Flemming Povlsen Hitzfeld's regular picks in the Dortmund frontline, Mill was more and more handed a sub-role and, at the end of Hitzfeld's debut season in charge of the club, missing out on the Bundesliga title again. For the second time in his career and, again, just on goal difference and due to final day action. Still the fan favourite at Westfalenstadion, Mill saw out his deal with the club in 1994 to join promoted Fortuna D√ºsseldorf in the 2nd Bundesliga. There he enjoyed two more seasons in the game, scoring five times in his first season at Rheinstadion, efforts that helped Fortuna returning to the Bundesliga. His final twelve months as a professional, the 1995‚Äì96 season, saw him having a bright start with two goals in the first three matches. He couldn't add any more in the final 26 appearances for D√ºsseldorf and though his final Bundesliga total was 123 goals in 387 appearances for Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, Borussia Dortmund and Fortuna D√ºsseldorf. Short after the end of his career, Fortuna D√ºsseldorf offered him a role as a director in their management. A role he later left by mutual consent following bad success.

Stakman married the plant pathologist Estelle Louise Jensen in 1917. He also had a major hand in influencing Norman Borlaug to pursue a career in phytopathology. In 1938, in a speech entitled \\"These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops\\", Stakman discussed the manifestation of the plant disease rust, a parasitic fungus that feeds on phytonutrients, in wheat, oat and barley crops across the US. He had discovered that special plant breeding methods created plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated due to budget cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest pathology. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead, and Borlaug subsequently re-enrolled to the University of Minnesota to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug went on to discover varieties of dwarf wheat that helped reduce famine in India, Pakistan, and other countries, and received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 1970. Stakman died in 1979 of a stroke. In Stakman's honor, Stakman Hall was named for him on the University of Minnesota's St. Paul campus, providing space for Plant Pathology and related fields.

Starring popular Chinese actor Zhao Dan (Ëµµ‰∏π) and iconic Chinese singer Zhou Xuan (Âë®Áíá), the story is set in the slums of Shanghai, chronicling the lives of a band of downtrodden underclass outcasts: a tea house singer, a trumpet player, a newspaper hawker, and a prostitute. The film was released towards the end of the golden age of Shanghai cinema and is regarded as a masterpiece of the Chinese left-wing movement. It also alludes to some of the national struggles faced in China at the time, including issues around economic policy and military conflict. In addition, the depiction of an impoverished neighborhood in a modern city is a compelling examination of how modernization had affected China spatially during this era. The film‚Äôs setting is also a comment on the combined effects of modernization and colonialism in Shanghai, specifically. Guo-Juin Hong (2009) Meet me in Shanghai: melodrama and the cinematic production of space in 1930s Shanghai leftist films, Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 3:3, 215-230, DOI: 10.1386/jcc.3.3.215/1 p. 217 As one of China‚Äôs earliest sound films, Street Angel also made a name for itself by popularizing two timeless ballads: ‚ÄúSong of the Seasons‚Äù (ÂõõÂ≠£Ê≠å) and ‚ÄúThe Wandering Songstress‚Äù (Â§©Ê∂ØÊ≠åÂ•≥), both of which are still celebrated as classics of Chinese modern song evolution. Plot Set in the slums of old Shanghai, the film begins with a wedding procession. Xiao Chen (Zhao Dan), a trumpet player in the marching band, establishes a romantic connection with his neighbour, the singer Xiao Hong (Zhou Xuan), who has fled the Japanese invasion of Manchuria with her older sister Xiao Yun (Zhao Huishen). With limited resources and connections, the two sisters are taken in by a couple that owns a tea house and made to work for them. Xiao Yun is forced into prostitution to make a living, while Xiao Hong works as a singer at the tea house. The film continues to slowly develop the flirtatious relationship between Xiao Hong and her neighbour Xiao Chen. However, one day, Xiao Chen's friend the Barber (Qian Qianli) sees Mr. Gu, a gangster and frequenter of the tea house where Xiao Hong works, take Xiao Hong out after getting a hair cut from the barbershop where the Barber works. The Barber then tells Ah Bing, the young peddler who is also friends with Xiao Chen, to follow Mr. Gu and Xiao Hong, and Ah Bing watches them buying cloth and eating together. When Ah Bing and the Barber tell Xiao Chen what they saw, Xiao Chen misunderstands and, thinking Xiao Hong is seeing other men, he runs back to his room, upset. Later, Xiao Chen and Xiao Hong get into a fight and Xiao Hong runs back home. When Xiao Yun returns, she sees a sobbing Xiao Hong and comforts her. Later, Xiao Chen and Wang are drinking at the tea house and Xiao Chen gets intoxicated and demands Xiao Hong sing him a song. She reluctantly sings him the song, \\"The Wandering Songstress,\\" but he leaves angrily before she is able to finish. Soon after, Xiao Hong overhears that her benefactors are scheming to sell her off to Mr. Gu. She runs to Xiao Chen for support, but he shuns her, still under the impression that she is unfaithful. Eventually, Xiao Chen comes to realize that Xiao Hong only has eyes for him, and he agrees to let her seek refuge with him and Wang. After hearing of the impending transaction involving Xiao Hong, Xiao Chen and Wang go to consult Lawyer Zhang to see if they can do anything to stop it. However, they realize that they cannot afford the costly legal fees. Without this legal help, the group flees to another district of Shanghai. Xiao Yun also escapes the teahouse to reunite with the others, and she envisions starting a new life with Xiao Chen‚Äôs friend, Wang. However, the owner of the tea house and Mr. Gu soon track them all down. Xiao Hong manages to escape, but Xiao Yun stays behind and refuses to reveal her sister‚Äôs whereabouts to her adoptive father. He heartlessly calls her a slut and throws her against the wall, to which she responds by throwing a knife at him. The knife misses and he picks it up and throws it back at her, striking her in the chest and dealing a fatal blow. The others come back only to find her half-conscious. Without any money for a doctor, however, there is little they can do but band together. She dies with the group gathered around her, mourning.

The thematic music, singing and dancing present in the film solidified the mainstream status of 'new citizen' films around 1937 when the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. The film‚Äôs year of release was in fact the same year that Japan launched its full-scale attack on China. Guo-Juin Hong (2009) Meet me in Shanghai: melodrama and the cinematic production of space in 1930s Shanghai leftist films, Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 3:3, 215-230, DOI: 10.1386/jcc.3.3.215/1 p. 216 The film also strengthened classical production types and promoted the national spirit by successfully encouraging Chinese citizens and filmmakers to bypass the destruction the war brought to national culture and to the styles of the films in Japanese invaded areas. As a result, 'Street Angel' laid a foundation of thought and art for the rapid restoration of post-war Chinese film.Malu Tianshi: Classical Film of New Citizens in the Context of Left Wing Films and National Defence Films Ë¢ÅÂ∫Ü‰∏∞(Qing-Feng Yuan) Street Angel is now considered a vivid portrait of Shanghai street life in the 1930s, \\"capturing the earthy energy and wild collective mood swings\\" that existed in Shanghai culture prior to the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War. This landmark work that male lead Zhao Dan described as \\"'a film about the lowest strata of society in Shanghai‚Äù has now become one of the classics of the \\"leftist\\" filmmaking period in China, which reached its peak in the 1930s. In 2005, Street Angel was selected as one of the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures by the 24th Hong Kong Film Awards, ranked 11th.  Analysis  Street Angel, a story of solidarity, friendship, and love amongst the dregs of urban society, has been interpreted in different ways. The film successfully \\"describe[s] the wide gulf between rich and poor in the city\\". According to the Encyclopedia of Chinese Film, the film is \\"certainly a critique of Shanghai's semi-colonialist society... it has even been described as a Chinese forerunner of Italian neo- realism. A canonized leftist film, it combines Hollywood and Soviet film techniques with traditional Chinese narrative arts.\\" Summary by Zhiwei Xiao, Yingjin Zhang Encyclopedia of Chinese Film page 321 Some scholars believe the film to have been inspired by American director Frank Borzage's 1927 Seventh Heaven, though the title recalls Borzage's film of the same name from 1928, Street Angel. In addition to the clear American influence, the notable Soviet influence appears in such formal choices as the extensive use of quick cuts of close-ups, and in the visually-captivating opening sequence. These techniques are often seen in other classic films such as City Scenes (Dushi fengguang) in 1935.Pang, Laikwan. Building a New China in Cinema: The Chinese Left-Wing Cinema Movement, 1932-1937. MCLC Resource Center Publication, Oct. 2007, http://u.osu.edu/mclc/book-reviews/building-a-new-china/. Accordingly, the dazzling three-minute opening sequence of the 1937 Street Angels displays ‚Äúa key trope of the cinematic portrayal of 1930s Shanghai: the simultaneous existence of competing forces from different colonial powers. Tensions among various visual and aural elements are arranged in an ostensibly chronological order, a form also popular in the European avante-garde cinema of the 1920s.‚Äù Guo-Juin Hong (2009) Meet me in Shanghai: melodrama and the cinematic production of space in 1930s Shanghai leftist films, Journal of Chinese Cinemas, 3:3, 215-230, DOI: 10.1386/jcc.3.3.215/1 p. 216 link=File:Zhou_Xuan_singing_%22The_Wandering_Songstress%22.jpg Alexander Des Forges of the University of Massachusetts-Boston argues that Xiao Chen, not Xiao Hong, is \\"the primary recipient of the heterosexual gaze\\" throughout the film, as Chen captures the attention of not only his eventual wife Xiao Hong, but also Xiao Yun and two of his landladies. Like Jin Yan in the 1934 Chinese classic The Big Road, Zhao Dan represented a different kind of male star, with a \\"jokey and hyperactive sexuality\\" and masculinity, unlike the more effeminate Chinese male stars of an earlier age. Left Wing Movement The Left Wing Movement began in 1930, although it was officially founded in 1932. The movement emphasized anti‚Äìimperialism and class struggle. The movement also led to the foundation of the China Film Culture Society (Zhongguo dianying wenhua xiehui) in February, 1933. Some capitalist film studio owners and petty bourgeois filmmakers had the idea to resist Japanese aggression and change society, to a certain degree paralleling the paradigm of the left wing. Consequently, the ‚ÄúChinese Film Culture Movement (Zhongguo dianying wenhua yundong)‚Äù replaced the ‚ÄúChinese Left Wing Film Movement,‚Äù as increasing numbers of professionals in the film production industry joined the China Film Culture Society. The themes of films considered left-wing were usually associated with class struggle; this concretely became the major theme as the movement progressed. Films about class struggle were often filmed from the perspective of laboring people. Until early 1936, left-wing organizations in literature and art circles were dissolved because of the intensified Japanese aggression. The Mingxing studio was closely tied to left-wing film production. Mingxing‚Äôs films, aimed at revealing the dimensions of class conflict, caused great responses among viewers. Hu, J. (2003). Chapter 4: Class Nationalism Versus Traditionalist Nationalism (1931 - 1936). In Projecting a nation: Chinese national cinema before 1949. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. Production Produced by Mingxing Company, the film was framed and photographed in Shanghai. Director Yuan Muzhi used much of the city of Shanghai itself, such as Shanghai‚Äôs grand colonial buildings, as well as the neon street lights of the 1930s. These visual features serve to contrast the succeeding display of areas of Shanghai marked by narrow streets and neighbourhood poverty. Street Angel was released during a time of increasing censorship by the Nationalist government, and general conservatism in films. The Central Film Censorship Committee (CFCC) and more restrictive censorship laws instituted by the KMT, forced many left-wing films to either ‚Äòfix‚Äô certain lines of dialogue and plot elements or be banned. Subsequently, films like Street Angel borrowed \\"acceptable\\" elements from Hollywood in order to circumvent censorship.  Music  During the 1930s, Chinese filmmakers were inclined to view cinema as a Western invention. Despite this view, filmmakers in China felt the need to incorporate indigenous and cultural elements that would be deemed more appropriate for Chinese audiences, and they did this mostly through the soundtrack inclusions. As one of the early sound films in China, Street Angel is often praised for its innovative use of music, as well as its unique mix of melodrama and comedy. One sequence in particular, where Xiao Chen and his friends attempt to act as barbers, reveals a moment of slapstick or physical comedy in the otherwise dreary third act. The film also features several significant musical interludes. The two original songs featured in 'Street Angel' are \\"Song of the Four Seasons\\" (ÂõõÂ≠£Ê≠å) and \\"The Wandering Songstress\\"(Â§©Ê∂ØÊ≠åÂ•≥), both composed by He L√ºting, with lyrics by Tian Han. Like the character Xiao Hong, Zhou Xuan herself had barely escaped being sold: at the age of ten, she narrowly avoided being sold to a brothel, and was instead apprenticed to a song and dance troupe based in Shanghai. She went on to become known as the \\"golden voice,\\" and after she performed the two abovementioned songs in the film, they became popular and are still recognized as musical expressions of the turbulent 1930s era of Chinese history. Today, these two songs continue to be considered two of the most famous songs in modern Chinese culture. The use of these popular songs, amongst other popular songs of their era, were used to express and emphasize national Chinese characteristics, distinguishing Chinese culture from that of the West. \\"The Wandering Songstress\\" was derived from tanci (a traditional story‚Äìtelling performance originating in Suzhou). It combined a traditional element, in that it was accompanied by a Huqin (a two‚Äìstring bowed instrument). Chen, S. (2005). The rise and generic features of Shanghai popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s. Popular Music, 24(1), 107-125. doi:10.1017/s0261143004000297 While both songs were essential to the film‚Äôs success, ‚ÄúSong of the Four Seasons,‚Äù specifically, was pivotal in that it was performed alongside pseudo- documentary war footage. ‚ÄúSong of the Four Seasons‚Äù offers an insight into this era's circumstances of suffering that led to people‚Äôs plight: it compels the audience with its lyrical description of a maiden driven away from her home, the musical tale accompanied by a montage of war images that evoked Japan‚Äôs invasion of Manchuria. Ma, Jean. Sounding the modern woman: the songstress in Chinese cinema. Duke University, 2015. Because the footage was played alongside the performance of a love song, the film was able to deliver a message condemning the Japanese invasion without arousing the censors. In late 1930s Shanghai, the National Party exercised strict control over cultural production, meaning that any reference to the Japanese invasion was prohibited, to prevent provoking the masses to rise against Japan‚Äôs military aggression. According to scholar Jean Ma, the differences in the two songs present two separate fates for Xiao Hong: she could either become the possession of the wealthy teahouse client, Mr. Gu, or the lover of the poor musician, Xiao Chen. There are also differences in the film's thematic articulation of the songs, as Xiao Hong offers her values and affection in her performance of \\"The Wandering Songstress,\\" but shows more resistance in her performance of \\"Song of the Four Seasons\\". Theatrical elements 'Street Angels' constructed a theatrical-style mise-en‚Äìsc√©ne by using the distinctive element of a back alley, or lilong (ÈáåÂºÑ), in Shanghai. Lilongs are a typical architectural feature in Shanghai that can be dated back to the city's founding. People‚Äôs gaze in the illustrations directed the viewer‚Äôs attention from a higher position to a lower position. The lower buildings became the focus, as they are the object of the woman‚Äôs gaze in the illustration. This type of composition can be seen in periodicals from the 1880s onwards, as well as in collections such as 'An Illustrated Explanation of Local Customs' (È¢®‰øóÂøóÂúñË™™, Fengsu zhi tushuo) and 'A Hundred Beauties of Shanghai' (Êµ∑‰∏äÁôæËâ∑Âúñ, Haishang baiyan tu). The theatre is used as model to represent the urban streets and alleys of Shanghai. People‚Äôs downward gaze from the box seats is similar to that of the characters in the picture: over‚Äìlooking alleys from the second floor. Therefore, Shanghai's alleys are fundamentally theatrical in nature. In 'Street Angels,' the setting enhances the mise‚Äì en‚Äìsc√©ne in the way that it features people leaning out of windows and watching alleys. When the shot return to the balcony, it signals the narrative beginning. Many shots in 'Street Angel' are from second‚Äìstorey windows, reminding viewers of the composition of the lithographed illustration and the view from the box seats in stage theatres. Also, the shots between Xiao Hong and Xiao Chen‚Äôs second‚Äìfloor rooms maintain the practice of theatrical spectatorship. The equal attention devoted between Xiao Hong and Xiao Chen, which is created by a 180 pan, is similar to the exchanges between men and women in box seats in the theatre.

An expert on petroleum geology and mineralogy, Mather was a prominent scholar, advocate for academic freedom, social activist, and critic of McCarthyism. He is known for his efforts to harmonize the dialogue between science and religion, his role in the Scopes \\"Monkey Trial\\", his faith-based liberal activism, and his advocacy for adult education programs. Early life Kirtley Mather was the second of six children born to William Green Mather (1855‚Äì1937) and Julia Sabrina King (1860‚Äì1938). William Mather was the son of a Baptist minister. Mather is related to Increase and Cotton Mather, well known New England Puritan ministers. They are all directly descended from Rev. Richard Mather. The family‚Äôs religious heritage would be significant in forming young Mather‚Äôs social conscience. Mather was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from South Chicago High School in 1904. After completing his first two years of undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago, he transferred to Denison University, where the school had a strong Baptist heritage and his older brother was a student. After graduating from Denison in 1909, he returned to the University of Chicago, where he completed his Ph.D. degree in 1915.

As an academic scientist, Mather's areas of expertise were in the fields of petroleum geology and mineralogy. His teaching career began at the University of Arkansas (1911‚Äì1914), while he was still in his doctoral program. After completing his graduate studies, he held faculty positions at Queen's University (1915‚Äì1918) and Denison University (1918‚Äì1924), before beginning a 30-year teaching career at Harvard University in 1924. For a period of time during his tenure at Harvard, he served as chairman of the geology department. In addition to his teaching duties at Harvard, he served as the Director of the Harvard Summer School from 1933 through 1938. During his retirement in Albuquerque, he served as a visiting faculty member at the University of New Mexico. Mather was an energetic proponent of readily accessible adult education programs. Although he was associated with an elite university for 30 years, he believed that the interests of democracy were more closely associated with adult literacy and education programs for all citizens. Mather was a highly visible supporter of Dorothy Hewitt and the Boston Center for Adult Education she founded.Professor Mather Criticizes Modern College Instruction, Calls Adult Education Only Hope for Survival of Democracy The Harvard Crimson, November 23, 1937, Retrieved 21 January 2013 Mather was entrusted with leadership responsibilities for several national professional organizations. In 1938, he served as the head of the Association of Summer Session Deans and Directors. In 1951, he became a member of the board of trustees for Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public. He served as board president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from 1948-1956 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences from 1957‚Äì1961. For his scholarship in the field of geology, he was awarded the Cullum Geographical Medal in 1965.American Geographical Society Retrieved 13 January 2013 Additionally, in 1964, for his book The Earth Beneath Us, Mather received the Edison Award for the best science book for young people and the Book Award of the Geographic Society of Chicago. Scopes \\"Monkey Trial\\" Mather is known for his role in the 1925 Scopes \\"Monkey Trial\\". For the trial he submitted a deposition for the defense and helped Clarence Darrow rehearse his questioning of William Jennings Bryan. Mather's biographer, Kennard Bork, notes this in relation to Mather's involvement with the trial: > By 1924 Mather had already perceived the threat of biblical literalism as > used by some segments of the religious Right. Offended by methods and claims > of the anti-evolutionists, he declared that his love of religion, as well as > his commitment to science, drove him to oppose William Jennings Bryan and > the prosecutors of organic evolution.Cracking Rocks and Defending Democracy, > Kirtley Fletcher Mather, scientist, teacher, social activist, 1888-1978 > (preface) Links to two video interviews with Mather regarding the trial are included in the External links section below. Academic freedom and social activism Mather with Cornell President Edmund Ezra Day in 1947 Mather became well known for his commitment to progressive social causes, serving as the first president of Promoting Enduring Peace. From the academy, to the court room and on the national stage, Mather was a determined advocate and activist for academic freedom and human rights. A harbinger of Mather‚Äôs willingness to stakeout unpopular positions in the service of academic freedom is what his biographer, Kennard Bork refers to as the ‚ÄúKornhauser Affair‚Äù at Denison University in 1922. In this instance Mather championed the cause of Professor Sidney I. KornhauserS.I.

Massachusetts Teachers‚Äô Oath Mather took a leadership role in resisting the Massachusetts Teachers' Oath of 1935. The loyalty oath was adopted by the Massachusetts state legislature and enforced by Harvard President James B. Conant. The entire affair contributed to efforts by Mather and fellow Harvard faculty members like F.O. Matthiessen and Max Lerner to form the Cambridge Union of University Teachers, Harvard‚Äôs chapter of the American Federation of Teachers. In 1937, Mather co-founded the Institute for Propaganda Analysis with Edward A. Filene and Clyde R.

During his retirement years in Albuquerque, he served as a visiting faculty member at the University of New Mexico. Mather died in 1978 in Albuquerque and is buried in Granville, Ohio. Legacy Mather was an accomplished scientist and academic who took progressive and often controversial stands on issues of academic freedom and human rights. In addition to the legacy of his scholarship, he stands among prominent twentieth century American scientists who sought to harmonize the dialogue between science and religion and to ally himself with progressive social causes. These career long efforts brought him recognition, criticism and honor.

Politainment, while outwardly emphasizing the political aspects of the information communicated, nevertheless draws heavily upon techniques from pop culture and journalism to make complex information more accessible or convincing and distract public attention from politically unfavorable topics. The interdependencies of politicians and media are known as the politico-media complex. Of doubtful virtue, declining amounts of content and substance can easily be compensated by giving news stories a sensationalistic twinge. Politainment thus ranges on the same level as edu- and infotainment. Typical catchlines in politainment reports or media will at times bluntly argue ad hominem in a generalizing manner and try to emphasize virtues and charisma (\\"xyz will make America great again\\") or vices and weaknesses (by denunciation: \\"xyz will wreck this country\\"). The latter example is also known as fear appeal. More moderate forms make extensive use of imprecise, metaphoric language (allegories, metonymy, periphrases, kennings etc.). Politainment can be both a communication aspect of (1) politicians and spin doctors to their and their party's own advantage and the political adversary's disadvantage or (2) a strategy for news publishers, journalists, etc., to promote their medium and journalistic work. Politainment may be a factor in party identification, mass-influencing voter's choices, it has thus become an indispensable tool in political campaigns and elections.David Schultz, Politainment, 2012 As such it can also be one of the‚Äîseemingly innocuous‚Äîingredients of crowd manipulation up to political psychological warfare.

The family of Edmondston (also spelt Edmonston) was prominent in 19th-century Shetland. Thomas Edmondston's uncle, also Thomas Edmondston, was laird of the Buness estate on Unst and host to many scientific visitors to Shetland. Another uncle, Dr Arthur Edmondston, had written A View of the Ancient and Present State of the Zetland Islands in 1809. His father, Laurence Edmondston, was also an accomplished naturalist. Edmondston compiled the first known list of Shetland plants at the age of 11. He discovered several rare plants growing on the serpentine rocks on Unst, including the endemic Shetland Mouse-ear Cerastium nigrescens, known as Edmondston's Chickweed on the island. In 1845, he produced his Flora of Shetland, which, despite a few shortcomings, was a considerable achievement given his age and it is still an important reference for Shetland botany. Less well known is his fauna, mainly a list of birds, published in the journal The Zoologist in 1844. This is less reliable and much of it was obviously derived much from the work of his father, Laurence, and his uncle, Arthur. Thomas Edmondston was appointed Professor of Botany at Anderson's University in Glasgow (now University of Strathclyde), at the age of just 20. A few months later, he was offered the position of naturalist on board HMS Herald, on a journey retracing the voyage of , and Charles Darwin became a frequent correspondent with requests for further observations. While disembarking from a boat on the coast of South America, however, Edmondston was killed by an accidentally discharged gun, cutting short a career of great promise. After his death, Charles Darwin was in regular correspondence with his father on Unst and was particularly interested in Edmonston's ongoing ornithological observations. The Edmonston family on Unst remain as Laird. Confusingly, after his death, his parents named another newborn son Thomas. References *Pennington, M. G., Osborn, K., Harvey, P.

Rikers Island Though her friends and family could not explain what triggered her involvement there, Margolis was involved in creating a wide range of programs for inmates at the Rikers Island prison facility operated by the New York City Department of Corrections. In 1980, she helped re-establish The Rikers Review, a magazine that includes literature and advice produced by inmates for the prisoner population. She ran Fresh Start from its creation in 1989 until 1997, with the goal of helping inmates to be released from prison find lower-level jobs in the food industry. As the program developed, it trained 60 people per year in classes given eight hours per day for a 10-week period covering the full range of restaurant jobs from preparing food to fixing equipment. The classes, some of which feature guest instructors from New York City restaurants, covers such areas as wine tasting, taught using different varieties of grape juice to address a prison ban on alcohol. Efforts by Margolis to help ex-prisoners rehabilitate included drug treatment and therapy while at Rikers, as well as continuing interaction after release. Margolis would take calls from former program participants at all hours of the day, often months after their release, and she would reach out to ensure that they had items such as ties that they might need for an interview. While 46% of the general population released from city prisons were back in jail within a year of release, the one-year recidivism rate for graduates of the Fresh Start program was 25%. Inmates held her in such regard that after her car was stolen from the prison parking lot it was immediately returned once it was discovered that it was her car that had been taken.

It was built in the 16th century and became home to a succession of Crimean Khans. The walled enclosure contains a mosque, a harem, a cemetery, living quarters and gardens. The palace interior has been decorated to appear lived in and reflects the traditional 16th-century Crimean Tatar style. It is one of the best known Muslim palaces found in Europe, alongside Topkapƒ± Palace, Dolmabah√ße Palace, Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, Aynalƒ±kavak Palace, Edirne Palace, √áƒ±raƒüan Palace in Turkey and the Alhambra in Spain. History The city of Bakhchisaray and the palace were commissioned by the Crimean Khan dynasty, who moved their capital here from Sala√ßƒ±q in the first half of the 16th century. The palace's complex design and minarets were constructed in the 16th century by Ottoman, Persian and Italian architects. Later damages required partial reconstruction, but the structure still has a resemblance to its original form. Some buildings currently in the palace were attached later, while some of the original buildings could not stand past the 18th century.ArchNet.org - Tatar Khans' Palace Complex, 2005 In 2017, the palace was subject to restoration, which was conducted by Moscow-based Atta Group, a firm with little experience in historical preservation. As part of the process, the palace's centuries-old oak beams were removed and replaced with concrete, original tiles were removed, while its 18th century murals were damaged by a high-pressure water stream. In addition, cracks appeared on the facade of the building and plaster fell off during pressure cleaning. In response to the alleged damages, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine sent a protest notice to UNESCO, which manages the World Heritage Sites, since the Bakhchisaray Place was added to the organization's Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in 2003. Bakhchisaray Fountain One courtyard contains a small fountain whose sad story so moved the Russian writer Alexander Pushkin when he visited it that he wrote a long narrative poem titled \\"The Fountain of Bakhchisaray\\". Fountain of Tears Bakhchisaray Fountain or Fountain of Tears is a real case of life imitating art. The fountain is known as the embodiment of love of one of the last Crimean Khans, Qƒ±rƒ±m Giray Khan, for his young wife, and his grief after her early death. The Khan was said to have fallen in love with this Polish girl Maria in his harem. Maria is presumed to have been slain by the khan's former favourite Georgian wife Zarema, who had been supplanted in his affections by the captive Pole. Despite his battle-hardened harshness, he grieved and wept when she died, astonishing all those who knew him. He commissioned a marble fountain to be made, so that the rock would weep, like him, forever.Johnstone, Sarah. Ukraine. Lonely Planet, 2005. Originally placed by the young woman's tomb in a restful garden, the fountain was transferred to its current location in the Ambassadors' courtyard after Catherine II ordered the annexation of the Crimean territory. Pushkin's verses are credited in part for ensuring the survival of the palace itself to date. The Big Khan Mosque Minaret The Big Khan Mosque () is located on the Palace Square to the east of the northern gate. It is one of the largest mosques in the Crimea and one of the first buildings of the Khan's palace. The mosque was built in 1532 by Sahib I Giray and bore his name in the 17th century. The mosque consists of a three-aisle square prayer hall covered with a hipped roof, a narthex and porticos facing east and west. Two symmetrical octagonal minarets rise through the porticos; they are twenty-eight meters high and have conical caps and finials. A domed ablution kiosk of square shape is attached to the northeastern corner of the mosque. It is believed that a madrasah built by Khan Arslan Giray in 1750 used to adjoin the eastern wall. The mosque is entered from a portal facing north. Inside, a balcony is attached to three of the four walls, part of which is sectioned off for the Khan's lodge. Scholars argue that the mosque was originally roofed with domes of various sizes. In 1736 the mosque was damaged by fire and later restored during the reign of Khan Selameta Giray. Small Khan Mosque The Small Khan Mosque () is located in the main building and was designed for members of the Khan's family and important dignitaries. Construction of the small mosque dates back to the 16th century, and paintings in the mosque are from the 17th and 18th centuries Mihrab in the Small Mosque In the south wall is the mihrab, the upper part of which is cut seven ornamented belts, symbolizing the seven levels of heaven. Above the mihrab is a stained glass window, which shows the seal of Suleiman (hexagram). On the walls of the small mosque are scratched images of boats with sails, horses and horsemen.

His writings compared Eastern and Western philosophy, and the teachings of Sri Aurobindo in comparison with Western philosophers. Life Maitra was born into a Brahmin family, and as his father - who served as a Professor of English literature at the Dacca, Presidency and Ravenshaw Colleges - was very liberal in his views on social and religious matters, young Sisir was brought up free from social and religious orthodoxy. Maitra snr was also a great admirer of Rabindranath Tagore, and this was part of the intellectual atmosphere in which Sisir and his siblings lived. In his college days he was for a short time a great admirer of Hegel. His faith in the supremacy of reason was shaken by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, to which he devoted several years of study. Later he discovered Sri Aurobindo, and in a number of books and essays helped popularise the vision of Sri Aurobindo among philosophical circles both in India and abroad, writing strictly from an academic philosophical point of view. The other philosopher who made a large influence on his mature thought was Nicolai Hartmann.

Snakes, like other reptiles, have skin covered in scales.Boulenger, George A. 1890 The Fauna of British India. p. 1 Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. A scale protects the body of the snake, aids it in locomotion, allows moisture to be retained within, alters the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage, and in some cases even aids in prey capture (such as Acrochordus). The simple or complex colouration patterns (which help in camouflage and anti-predator display) are a property of the underlying skin, but the folded nature of scaled skin allows bright skin to be concealed between scales then revealed in order to startle predators. Scales have been modified over time to serve other functions such as 'eyelash' fringes, and protective covers for the eyesThe Snakes of Indiana at The Centre for Reptile and Amphibian Conservation and Management, Indiana. Retrieved 14 August 2006. with the most distinctive modification being the rattle of the North American rattlesnakes. Snakes periodically moult their scaly skins and acquire new ones. This permits replacement of old worn out skin, disposal of parasites and is thought to allow the snake to grow. The arrangement of scales is used to identify snake species. Snakes have been part and parcel of culture and religion. Vivid scale patterns have been thought to have influenced early art. The use of snake-skin in manufacture of purses, apparel and other articles led to large-scale killing of snakes, giving rise to advocacy for use of artificial snake-skin. Snake scales are also to be found as motifs in fiction, art and films. Functions of scales The scales of a snake primarily serve to reduce friction as it moves, since friction is the major source of energy loss in snake locomotion. Rainbow boas get their name from the coloration of their scales caused by iridescence. The ventral (or belly) scales, which are large and oblong, are especially low-friction, and some arboreal species can use the edges to grip branches. Snake skin and scales help retain moisture in the animal's body.Barnes, Thomas G. Snakes: Information for Kentucky Homeowners. University of Kentucky. Snakes pick up vibrations from both the air and the ground, and can differentiate the two, using a complex system of internal resonances (perhaps involving the scales). Evolution Reptiles evolved from amphibious ancestors which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin and developing a thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an impermeable barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, as can be seen when the snake sheds its skin as a whole. Morphology of scales Keeled scales of Buff-striped keelback alt=Section of body of a snake is shown. It has brown, black and buff coloured scales. The vretebral scales form a buff-coloured row in which the keels are prominently seen. Snake scales are formed by the differentiation of the snake's underlying skin or epidermis. Each scale has an outer surface and an inner surface. The skin from the inner surface hinges back and forms a free area which overlaps the base of the next scale which emerges below this scale. A snake hatches with a fixed number of scales. The scales do not increase in number as the snake matures nor do they reduce in number over time. The scales however grow larger in size and may change shape with each moult.Are snakes slimy? at Singapore Zoological Garden's Docent. Retrieved 14 August 2006. Snakes have smaller scales around the mouth and sides of the body which allow expansion so that a snake can consume prey of much larger width than itself. Snake scales are made of keratin, the same material that hair and fingernails are made of. They are cool and dry to touch.Herpetology FAQ at San Diego Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 14 August 2006. Surface and shape Snake scales are of different shapes and sizes. Snake scales may be granular, have a smooth surface or have a longitudinal ridge or keel on it. Often, snake scales have pits, tubercles and other fine structures which may be visible to the naked eye or under a microscope. Snake scales may be modified to form fringes, as in the case of the eyelash bush viper, Atheris ceratophora, or rattles as in the case of the rattlesnakes of North America. Certain primitive snakes such as boas, pythons and certain advanced snakes such as vipers have small scales arranged irregularly on the head. Other more advanced snakes have special large symmetrical scales on the head called shields or plates. Cycloid scales on Leptotyphlops humilis and other blind snake species are fluorescent, as a result when they are put under low frequency ultraviolet light (black light) they glow. Snake scales occur in variety of shapes. They may be cycloid as in family Typhlopidae,Boulenger, George A. The Fauna of British India... page 234 long and pointed with pointed tips, as in the case of the green vine snake Ahaetulla nasuta,Smith, Vol III, p. 6 broad and leaf-like, as in the case of green pit vipers Trimeresurus spp. or as broad as they are long, for example, as in rat snake Ptyas mucosus. In some cases, scales may be keeled weakly or strongly as in the case of the buff-striped keelback Amphiesma stolatum. They may have bidentate tips as in some spp of Natrix. Some snakes, such as the short seasnake Lapemis curtus, may have spinelike and juxtaposed scales while others may have large and non-overlapping knobs as in the case of the Javan mudsnake Xenodermus javanicus. Another example of differentiation of snake scales is a transparent scale called the brille or spectacle which covers the eye of the snake. The brille is often referred to as a fused eyelid. It is shed as part of the old skin during moulting. Rattles Modified tail scales form a rattle on a Western Diamondback Rattlesnake alt=Part of the coils of an orange-brown rattlesnake are shown with head resting on top of one and a nine segmented rattle dangling in front of the coils.The most distinctive modification of the snake scale is the rattle of rattlesnakes, such as those of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of a rattlesnake. Only the bottom is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.Reptiles ‚Äì Snake facts. Columbus Zoo & Aquarium. Retrieved on 2013-01-21.

Retrieved on 2013-01-21. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.Rhoades, Dusty. Spring rattles in! Desert USA website. Colour Scales mostly consist of hard beta keratins which are basically transparent. The colours of the scale are due to pigments in the inner layers of the skin and not due to the scale material itself. Scales are hued for all colours in this manner except for blue and green. Blue is caused by the ultrastructure of the scales. By itself, such a scale surface diffracts light and gives a blue hue, while, in combination with yellow from the inner skin it gives a beautiful iridescent green. Some snakes have the ability to change the hue of their scales slowly. This is typically seen in cases where the snake becomes lighter or darker with change in season. In some cases, this change may take place between day and night. Ecdysis Empty skin (alt=The brown shed skin of a snake in an open inverted heart-shaped coil on a white background. The shedding of scales is called ecdysis, or, in normal usage moulting or sloughing. In the case of snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer.Smith, Vol I, p. 30 Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out. Moulting serves a number of functions ‚Äì firstly, the old and worn skin is replaced, secondly, it helps get rid of parasites such as mites and ticks. Renewal of the skin by moulting is supposed to allow growth in some animals such as insects, however this view has been disputed in the case of snakes.ZooPax Scales Part 3. Whozoo.org. Retrieved on 2013-01-21. Moulting is repeated periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or moves to a safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake \\"crawls\\" out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces. In many cases the cast skin peels backward over the body from head to tail, in one piece like an old sock. A new, larger, and brighter layer of skin has formed underneath.General Snake Information. Division of Wildlife, South Dakota An older snake may shed its skin only once or twice a year, but a younger, still- growing snake, may shed up to four times a year. The discarded skin gives a perfect imprint of the scale pattern and it is usually possible to identify the snake if this discard is reasonably complete and intact. Arrangement of scales alt=The head of a snake picnhed between thumbs held up so to display the names and position of the head scales of one side. Scale arrangements are important, not only for taxonomic utility, but also for forensic reasons and conservation of snake species. Excepting for the head, snakes have imbricate scales, overlapping like the tiles on a roof.Smith, Vol III, p. 5 Snakes have rows of scales along the whole or part of their length and also many other specialised scales, either singly or in pairs, occurring on the head and other regions of the body. The dorsal (or body) scales on the snake's body are arranged in rows along the length of their bodies. Adjacent rows are diagonally offset from each other. Most snakes have an odd number of rows across the body though certain species have an even number of rows e.g. Zaocys spp. In the case of some aquatic and marine snakes, the scales are granular and the rows cannot be counted. The number of rows range from ten in Tiger Ratsnake Spilotes pullatus; thirteen in Dryocalamus, Liopeltis, Calamaria and Asian coral snakes of genus Calliophis; 65 to 75 in pythons; 74 to 93 in Kolpophis and 130 to 150 in Acrochordus. The majority of the largest family of snakes, the Colubridae have 15, 17 or 19 rows of scales.Smith, Vol III, p. 7 The maximum number of rows are in mid-body and they reduce in count towards the head and on the tail. Nomenclature of scales The various scales on a snake's head and body are indicated in the following paragraphs with annotated photographs of Buff-striped Keelback Amphiesma stolata, a common grass-snake of South Asia and a member of Colubridae, the largest snake family. Head scales alt=The head of a dead snake lying inverted on the ground which displays the names and position of the head scales of the underside. Identification of cephalic scales is most conveniently begun with reference to the nostril, which is easily identified on a snake. There are two scales enclosing the nostril which are called the nasals. In colubrids, the nostril lies between the nasals, while in vipers it lies in the centre of a single nasal scale.Identifying snakes by scalation and other details. Wildsideholidays The outer nasal (near the snout) is called the prenasal while the inner nasal (near the eye) is called the postnasal. Along the top of the snout connecting the nasals on both sides of the head are scales called internasals. Between the two prenasals is a scale at the tip of the snout called the rostral scale. The scales around the eye are called circumorbital scales and are named as ocular scales but with appropriate prefixes. The ocular scale proper is a transparent scale covering the eye which is called the spectacle, brille or eyecap.Evolution of snakes. Arachnophiliac.co.uk (2007-02-12). Retrieved on 2013-01-21. The circumorbital scales towards the snout or the front are called preocular scales, those towards the rear are called postocular scales, and those towards the upper or dorsal side are called supraocular scales. Circumorbital scales towards the ventral or lower side, if any, are called subocular scales. Between the preocular and the postnasal scales are one or two scales called loreal scales. Loreal scales are absent in elapids. The scales along the lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, adjacent to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards the tip of the snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of the top of the head has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales. Enlarged vertebral scales of Banded Krait alt=Part of the body of a snake having yellow and black rings. The body is triangular in section and has a prominent line of scales on the apical vertebral ridge. On the underside of the head, a snake has an anterior scale called the mental scale. Connected to the mental scale and all along the lower lips are the infralabials or lower labials. Along the chin connected to the infralabials is a pair of shields called the anterior chin shields. Next to the anterior chin shields, further back along the chin is another pair of shields called the posterior chin shields. In some texts the chinshields are referred to as submaxillary scales. Scales in the central or throat region, which are in contact with the first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales. The mental groove is a longitudinal groove on the underside of the head between the large, paired chin shields and continuing between the smaller gular scales. Body scales  The scales on the body of the snake are called the dorsal or costal scales. Sometimes there is a special row of large scales along the top of the back of the snake, i.e., the uppermost row, called the vertebral scales. The enlarged scales on the belly of the snake are called ventral scales or gastrosteges. The number of ventral scales can be a guide to the species. In \\"advanced\\" (Caenophidian) snakes, the broad belly scales and rows of dorsal scales correspond to the vertebrae, allowing scientists to count the vertebrae without dissection. Tail scales alt=The tail of a ded snake on the ground lying inverted to show the scales on the underside. At the end of the ventral scales of the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and reproductive material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal scale is considered to be the tail. Sometimes snakes have enlarged scales, either single or paired, under the tail; these are called subcaudals or urosteges. These subcaudals may be smooth or keeled as in Bitis arietans somalica. The end of the tail may simply taper into a tip (as in the case of most snakes), it may form a spine (as in Acanthophis), end in a bony spur (as in Lachesis), a rattle (as in Crotalus), or a rudder as seen in many sea snakes.

Taxonomic importance Scales do not play an important role in distinguishing between the families but are important at generic and specific level. There is an elaborate scheme of nomenclature of scales. Scales patterns, by way of scale surface or texture, pattern and colouration and the division of the anal plate, in combination with other morphological characteristics, are the principal means of classifying snakes down to species level. In certain areas in North America, where the diversity of snakes is not too large, easy keys based on simple identification of scales have been devised for the lay public to distinguish venomous snakes from non-venomous snakes.North Carolina State Wildlife Damage Notes ‚Äì Snakes . Ces.ncsu.edu. Retrieved on 2013-01-21.Pennsylvania State University ‚Äì Wildlife Damage Control 15 (pdf). (PDF) . Retrieved on 2013-01-21. In other places with large biodiversity, such as Myanmar, publications caution that venomous and non- venomous snakes cannot be easily distinguished apart without careful examination. The scales patterning may also be used for individual identification in field studies. Clipping of specific scales, such as the subcaudals, to mark individual snakes is a popular approach to population estimation by mark and recapture techniques.Resources Inventory Branch, Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks Resources Inventory Branch for the Terrestrial Ecosystems Task Force Resources Inventory Committee . (1998). Inventory Methods for Snakes Standards for Components of British Columbia's Biodiversity No. 38. Distinguishing between venomous and non-venomous snakes Banded Krait (alt=The head of a snake facing to the left pinched between thumbs. The gape is open and tongue protuding. The dorsal scales are coloured black and the ventral scales are yellowish-white in colour. The scales on the head are prominently seen as are the nostril and black beady eye between which are two hexagonal scales. There is no simple way of differentiating a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake with the help of experts,Thorpe, Roger S.; Thorpe, R. S.;W√ºster, Wolfgang & Malhotra, Anita (1997). Venomous snakes: ecology, evolution, and snakebite. Vol. 70 of Symposia of the Zoological Society of London. Oxford University Press, London. . or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not. Species identification using scales requires a fair degree of knowledge about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams whether a snake is venomous or not in the field cannot be done in the case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable to catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams. Most books or websites provide an array of traits of the local herpetofauna, other than scale diagrams, which help to distinguish whether a snake in the field is venomous or not.How To Identify Snakes. kentuckysnakes.org.Berger, Cynthia. (2007). Venomous Snakes. Stackpole books. . In certain regions, presence or absence of certain scales may be a quick way to distinguish non-venomous and venomous snakes, but used with care and knowledge of exceptions. For example, in Myanmar, the presence or absence of loreal scales can be used to distinguish between relatively harmless Colubrids and lethally venomous Elapids. The rule of hand for this region is that the absence of a loreal scale between the nasal scale and pre- ocular scale indicates that the snake is an Elapid and hence lethal. This rule-of-thumb cannot be used without care as it cannot be applied to vipers, which have a large number of small scales on the head. A careful check would also be needed to exclude known poisonous members of the Colubrid family such as Rhabdophis. In South Asia, it is advisable to take the snake which has bitten a person, if it has been killed, and carry it along to the hospital for possible identification by medical staff using scale diagrams so that an informed decision can be taken them as to whether and which anti-venom is to be administered. However, attempts to catch it or kill the venomous snake are not advised as the snake may bite more people.Directorate General Armed Forces Medical Services, India. Memorandum No 102 : Snakebite.

Snakes have been a motif in human culture and religion and an object of dread and fascination all over the world. The vivid patterns of snake scales, such as the Gaboon Viper, both repel and fascinate the human mind. Such patterns have inspired dread and awe in humans from pre-historic times and these can be seen in the art prevalent to those times. Studies of fear imagery and psychological arousal indicate that snake scales are a vital component of snake imagery. Snake scales also appear to have affected Islamic art in the form of tessellated mosaic patterns which show great similarity to snake-scale patterns. Snakeskin, with its highly periodic cross-hatch or grid patterns, appeals to people's aesthetics and have been used to manufacture many leather articles including fashionable accessories.Voland, Eckart and Grammer, Karl (2003) Evolutionary Aesthetics, Springer, pp. 108‚Äì116 .

He made expeditions to both the Arctic and Antarctic, and was chief scientist on Richard Evelyn Byrd's first Antarctic expedition, which Gould described in his 1931 book Cold: the Record of an Antarctic Sledge Journey. He served as president of Carleton College from 1945 to 1962, and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1964. His namesakes include the research vessel Laurence M. Gould as well as Antarctic features including Gould Bay, Gould Coast, and Mount Gould. Biography Gould was born in Lacota, Michigan on August 22, 1896. After completing high school in South Haven, Michigan in 1914, he went to Boca Raton, Florida and taught grades 1 to 8 in a one-room school for two years, while saving money for college. He enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1916, but interrupted his education the following year to enlist in the U.S. Army following U.S. entry into World War I. He served in the Army until 1919, when he returned to the university to resume his studies. After graduating in 1921 with a B.S. degree in geology he joined the University of Michigan faculty as a geology instructor while continuing his studies there. During his undergraduate days, he was the founder of the Beta Tau chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. He also was an active member in the university Society of Les Voyageurs. He received an M.A. degree in 1923 and a D.Sc. degree in 1925, with a dissertation on the geology of Utah's La Sal Mountains, and he advanced to assistant professor in 1926, and to associate professor in 1930. In the summer of 1926 Gould undertook his first trip to the Arctic, serving as assistant director and geologist with the University of Michigan Greenland Expedition. The following summer he was geographer and topologist for George P. Putnam's expedition to survey the coast of Baffin Island in Arctic Canada. During 1928 to 1930 he accompanied Admiral Richard E. Byrd on Byrd's first expedition to Antarctica, serving as the expedition's chief scientist and second-in-command. On November 4, 1929 Gould and five companions began a grueling 2¬Ω month, 1500-mile dog-sledge journey into the Queen Maud Mountains, with the primary purpose of providing ground support and possible emergency assistance for Byrd's historic first airplane flight over the South Pole and a secondary purpose of conducting the first geological and glaciological survey of an area that Gould called \\"a veritable paradise for a geologist.\\" After the flight over the Pole in November 1929, Gould and his companions climbed Mount Fridtjof Nansen to investigate its geology. The layered sandstones that Gould found in outcrops at the mountain's peak helped confirm that Antarctica was linked geologically to the Earth's other continents. The expedition's progress had been reported regularly in the news media, and after his return he received a Congressional Gold Medal, the 1930 David Livingstone Gold Medal of the American Geographical Society, and a Medal of the Mayor's Committee of the City of New York. On August 2, 1930, two weeks after returning from Antarctica, Gould married Margaret (\\"Peg\\") Rice in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She had been a student in one of his classes at the University of Michigan. Gould next to a bust of Richard E. Byrd in Antarctica, 1977 In the months and years after returning from Antarctica, Gould traveled around the US giving lectures on the experience. His 1931 book Cold: the Record of an Antarctic Sledge Journey described the dog-sledge trek, recalling blinding blizzards, snow bridges that collapsed into deep crevasses, and weather so cold that it nearly froze a person's eyelids shut. Additionally, he published several scientific articles about the findings of the Byrd expedition. In 1932 Gould accepted a position as full professor and chairman of the geology department at Carleton College, so the Goulds moved to Minnesota. Gould was named president of the college in 1945, holding that position until 1962. In 1963 he retired to Tucson, Arizona and taught Glaciology at the University of Arizona. He also served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. During his lifetime, Gould was the recipient of 26 honorary degrees. In 1995 Carleton College renamed its college library the Laurence McKinley Gould Library in his honor. The R/V Laurence M. Gould, a 76-m-long ice-strengthened research ship built in 1997 for the National Science Foundation and designed for year-round polar operations, is named in his honor. He is also commemorated in the names of several places in Antarctica, including Mount Gould, Gould Bay, and Gould Coast.

Most of the tunnel is in continuation of the open-air Western Wall and is located under buildings of the Muslim Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. While the open-air portion of the Western Wall is approximately long, the majority of its original length of is hidden underground. The tunnel allows access to the remainder of the Wall in a northerly direction. History In 19 BCE, King Herod undertook a project to double the area of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem by incorporating part of the hill on the Northwest. In order to do so, four retaining walls were constructed, and the Temple Mount was expanded on top of them. These retaining walls remained standing, along with the platform itself, after the Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. Since then much of the area next to the walls became covered and built upon. Part of the Western Wall remained exposed after the destruction of the Temple. Since it was the closest area to the Temple‚Äôs Holy of Holies that remained accessible, it became a place of Jewish prayer for millennia. Excavation Route of the Western Wall Tunnel British researchers started excavating the Western Wall in the mid 19th century. Charles Wilson began the excavations in 1864 and was followed by Charles Warren in 1867-70\\\\. Wilson discovered an arch now named for him, \\"Wilson's Arch\\" which was wide and is above present-day ground level. It is believed that the arch supported a bridge which connected the Temple Mount to the city during the Second Temple Period. Warren dug shafts through Wilson‚Äôs Arch which are still visible today. After the Six-Day War, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Israel began the excavations aimed at exposing the continuation of the Western Wall. The excavations lasted almost twenty years and revealed many previously unknown facts about the history and geography of the Temple Mount. The excavations were difficult to conduct, as the tunnels ran below residential neighborhoods constructed on top of ancient structures from the Second Temple Period. The excavations were conducted with the supervision of scientific and rabbinic experts. This was to ensure both the stability of the structures above and to prevent damaging the historic artifacts. In 1988 the Western Wall Heritage Foundation was formed, it took over the excavation, maintenance and renovations of the Western Wall and Western Wall Plaza. Features Women praying in the tunnel at the closest physical point to the Holy of Holies The Western Stone, biggest stone of the wall Western Wall section The tunnel exposes 300 m of the wall's total 445 m, revealing the construction methods and the various activities in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. The excavations included many archaeological finds along the way, including discoveries from the Herodian period (streets, monumental masonry), sections of a reconstruction of the Western Wall dating to the Umayyad period, and various structures dating to the Ayyubid, Mamluke and Hasmonean periods constructed to support buildings in the vicinity of the Temple Mount. Warren's Gate \\"Warren's Gate\\" lies about into the tunnel. This sealed-off entrance was for hundreds of years a small synagogue called \\"The Cave\\", where the early Muslims allowed the Jews to pray in close proximity to the ruins of the Temple. Rabbi Yehuda Getz built a synagogue just outside the gate, since today it is the closest point a Jew can pray near to the Holy of Holies, assuming it was located at the traditional site under the Dome of the Rock. Hasmonean Channel Beyond the northern end of the Western Wall, remains were found of a water channel that originally supplied water to the Temple Mount. The exact source of the channel is unknown, though it passes through an underground pool known as the \\"Struthion Pool\\". The water channel was dated to the Hasmonean period and was accordingly dubbed the \\"Hasmonean Channel\\". 517-tonne stone The biggest stone in the Western Wall, often called the Western Stone, is also revealed within the tunnel, and ranks as one of the heaviest objects ever lifted by human beings without powered machinery. The stone has a length of , height of , and an estimated width of between and ; estimates place its weight at . Chain of Generations Center Adjacent to the tunnel are the remains of Second Temple period, Crusader, and Mamluk structures. In the restored rooms, the Western Wall Foundation has created the Chain of Generations Center, a Jewish history museum designed by Eliav Nahlieli that includes an audiovisual show and nine glass sculptures created by glass artist Jeremy Langford. Roman street to the Temple Mount In 2007, the Israel Antiquities Authority uncovered an ancient Roman street thought to be from the second to fourth centuries. It was a side street which likely connected two major roads, and led up to the Temple Mount. The discovery of the road gave further evidence that Romans continued to use the Temple Mount after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. Excavations at the site continued as late as 2014, led by archaeologists Peter Gendelman and Ortal Chalaf on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA).Israel Antiquities Authority, Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2014, Survey Permits # A-7039 and A-7040 Struthion Pool The Struthion Pool (sometimes described as the \\"Struthion Pools\\", in the plural), is a large cuboid cistern, which gathered the rainwater from guttering on the Forum buildings. Prior to Hadrian, this cistern had been an open-air pool, but Hadrian added arch vaulting to enable the pavement to be placed over it. The existence of the pool in the first century is attested by Josephus, who reports that it was called \\"Struthius\\" (sparrow).Josephus, Jewish War 5:11:4 This Struthion Pool was originally built as part of an open-air water conduit by the Hasmoneans, which has since been enclosed; the source of the water for this conduit is currently unidentified. As a result of 1971 extensions to the original Western Wall Tunnel, the Hasmonean water system, which runs under Arab housing, became linked to the end of the Western Wall Tunnel, and later opened as a tourist attraction. The course takes a linear route starting at the Western Wall Plaza and passes through the modern tunnels and the ancient water system, ending at the Struthion Pool. The Sisters of Zion do not allow tourists to exit into the convent at the Struthion Pool, so tourists return through the narrow tunnels to the starting point, although this does create some logistical problems. Northern exit Concrete supports used to reinforce the ancient streets above in Jerusalem's Muslim Quarter. At the end of this tunnel is the northern exit Originally, visitors had to retrace their steps back to the entrance. A connection to the Hasmonean water system was made, but this still required them to make a U-turn once they had reached the Struthion Pool. Digging an alternative exit from the tunnel was proposed, but initially rejected on the grounds that any exit would be seen as an attempt by the Jewish authorities to stake a claim to ownership of the nearby land ‚Äî part of the Muslim Quarter of the city. In 1996, however, Benjamin Netanyahu authorized the creation of an exit leading to the Via Dolorosa, underneath the Ummariya madrasah. Over the subsequent few weeks, 80 people were killed as a result of riots against the creation of the exit. A modern wall divides the Struthion pool into two parts, preventing access between them. One side is visible from the western wall tunnels, and the other area is accessible from the Convent of the Sisters of Zion. Since then, it has been possible for large numbers of tourists to enter the tunnel's southern entrance near the Western Wall, walk the tunnel's length with a tour guide, and exit from the northern end. This exit is only open during daytime, owing to continued security concerns.

The Clarendon Award is an extremely competitive scholarship at the University of Oxford. Originally the award went to the top graduate student applicant in each department. All Oxford University graduate applicants are automatically considered for the Clarendon Scholarship. Established in 2000 and launched in 2001, annually, the scheme creates approximately 130 Clarendon Scholarships, formerly referred to as Clarendon Fund Bursaries, to university graduates from around the world and from across all subject areas, who demonstrate academic excellence and potential. In 2014, the scholarship community represented more than 50 nationalities. The Clarendon Scholarship enables the most distinguished and competitive scholars to undertake part- or full-time degree-bearing graduate study, including taught master's degrees (i.e., M.St., M.Sc., B.C.L., M.F.E., M.Phil., M.Th.), research master's (i.e., M.Sc. by Research), and research doctorates (i.e., D.Phil.s) at the University. It covers course fees and provides a grant for living expenses. As of 2014, there have been more than 1,300 recipients of scholarships from the Clarendon Fund, including around 350 Clarendon Scholars at Oxford in the academic year of 2014/15. History Financed by the Oxford University Press, the Clarendon Fund was established by the Council of the University of Oxford in 2000 and launched in 2001. The original aim of the Fund, as agreed by the Council, was to \\"assist the best overseas graduate students who obtain places to study in the University\\", regardless of financial capability and to remove any barriers between the best prospective graduate students and studying at the University of Oxford. However, in the year of the Clarendon Fund's 10th anniversary, from 1 September 2011, the ambit of the Fund and its scholarships would be expanded to include all nationalities and all fee statuses, as opposed to only candidates with overseas fee status. The Clarendon Fund is sponsored by Oxford University Press, from which it has received more than ¬£37 million. Not only does it cover fees and living expenses, but the scholarship community is also very active, providing scholars with opportunities ranging from career-oriented to cultural and social events, to foster long-lasting friendships between the scholars. Selection Every applicant applying for graduate study at the University of Oxford is automatically considered for the Clarendon Scholarship. Unlike many scholarships that highlight the need for a track record of leadership among their applicants, the Clarendon Scholarship focuses primarily on proven academic performance and potential for advancing their fields of study during and beyond their time in Oxford. Oxford believes that by electing and nurturing the best and brightest minds in any given field the advancement of their study at Oxford will, by its very nature, produce leaders in that field. The process of selection aims to award the scholarship to a number of students from each of the University's four academic divisions, allowing interdisciplinary interaction amongst the scholars. Scholars' Council The Clarendon Scholars' Council provides a platform to facilitate professional, academic and social development opportunities through an intellectually and socially interactive community. The Council for the Clarendon Scholars' Association is composed of several elected council officers as well as permanent representatives from the University. As a collective group, the council works to promote the reputation and global awareness of the Clarendon Scholarship and Oxford University through a strong alumni network, and internal and external collaborations. Former presidents of the association include: Claire Higgins (2012), Ramtin Amin (2013), Matthijs V√°k√°r (2014), Robert Brand (2015), Christine Moore (2016), Amy Kao (2017), Mark Brooke (2018), and Serte Donderwinkel (2019). Symbols Name Edward Hyde, later Earl of Clarendon and also Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1660-1667, wrote a famous and highly profitable work, History of the Great Rebellion about the English Civil War of the 17th century. The profits of his book were used to construct the University-owned Clarendon Building on Broad Street in central Oxford. The Clarendon Building was designed to house Oxford University Press (OUP), and so the Clarendon Fund was named in honour of this famous building and its historic linkages to OUP, the main benefactor of the Clarendon Scholarships. Logo The Clarendon Fund logo was designed in 2009 in the run-up to the Fund's 10th anniversary, and simplified and updated in 2014. It celebrates both the long history and traditions of Oxford and of OUP, as well as welcoming the Clarendon scholars who will write the pages of the University's future. It shows the statues of the Muses at the top of the Clarendon building, which are perhaps the building's most recognisable feature and an iconic part of the Oxford skyline. The building was constructed in the classical style from 1711-13 on the design of Nicholas Hawksmoor, a pupil of the famous architect Sir Christopher Wren. The font used with the logo is called Trajan Pro and has its origins in the Roman lettering found on Trajan's Column, which was completed in 113 CE. It was chosen specifically to complement the architectural style of the Clarendon building. Trajan remains one of the most widely used fonts in book jacket cover design, a further link to the Clarendon Building's original use as the home of OUP.

They performed a pop-friendly style of Garage rock, with strong punk and proto-punk influences. History Gods of Blitz were founded by Berlin-based musicians Sebastian G√§bel (vocals & bass), Olli Wong (guitar), Jens Freudenberg (guitar), and Jakob Kiersch (drums). Their debut album, Stolen Horse, has garnered praise throughout German media, as well as assorted Australian music magazines (after opening for Wolfmother), including Rolling Stone. With production from Torsten Otto and Gordon Raphael (The Strokes, Wildhearts) and mixing by Michael Ilbert (The Hives, The Cardigans, Hellacopters), the band delivered a sound familiar to the American and British indie scene dominating radio and music television at the time. Gods of Blitz also supported Max√Ømo Park and Nick Oliveri (ex-member of Queens of the Stone Age) during the Stolen Horse tour. In 2007 the band released their second album Reporting a Mirage and toured extensively to support the album. Singer Sebastian G√§bel left the band in 2008. The remaining members recruited singer Nico Kozik as replacement, released a third album Under the Radar in 2009 before disbanding later the same year. In 2012 the original line-up reunited for a series of concerts at the live venue Lido, Berlin.

Organizations that receive permanent representatives from their member states include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, NATO, the European Union, the African Union, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Organization of American States. Permanent representatives can be sent to subunits or field offices of an organization. For example, in addition to the permanent representatives sent to the United Nations headquarters in New York City, UN member states also appoint permanent representatives to other UN offices, such as those in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. Permanent representatives are often informally described as ambassadors. However, although a permanent representative typically holds the diplomatic rank of an ambassador, because they are accredited to an international organisation the official title is permanent representative. For example, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations is technically called the Permanent Representative to the UN, even though they are widely referred to as an ambassador. Diplomatic representatives of the Pope are titled apostolic nuncio or papal nuncio, which is equivalent to permanent representative.

Semester programs The Island School offers two 14-week semester programs each year and a 6-week summer term. Fall semester begins in late August and runs through early December and spring semester begins in late February and ends in the beginning of June. Summer term runs from late June to early August. Fall and spring semester program students complete a course of study in seven classes including Island School Seminar, Marine Ecology, Applied Scientific Research, Literature and Writing, Histories of the Bahamas, Applied Mathematics, and Land and Environmental Art. Students also participate in weekly Community Outreach classes with the Deep Creek Middle School. Summer programs focus on Applied Scientific Research and Human Ecology. History The Island School was founded in 1999 by Chris and Pam Maxey with support from the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. Chris Maxey taught at the school and in 1996, he received the Joukowsky Fellowship allowing him to work towards his master's in Marine Resource Management at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami. He initiated the Cape Eleuthera Marine Conservation Project (now the Cape Eleuthera Foundation) and began to set the framework to build a school and research station at Cape Eleuthera in The Bahamas. The project received a donation of of land donated by the Cape Eleuthera Resort & Yacht Club. Construction on the campus began in fall 1998. On March 15, 1999, Pam and Chris started the first 14-week, one-hundred-day Island School semester which included 22 students and 6 faculty members. Facilities What began as a three-building campus grew into a diverse system of interconnected facilities. The current campus comprises a faculty office and school store, two large dormitory buildings, four main classrooms, a boathouse, dining hall with outside patio seating, a student life and medical center, two two-story faculty apartment buildings, two open-air gazebos, a living-roof multi-use building, a farm and orchard, a bio-diesel production facility, wood shop, a resource processing center, and in addition, the adjacent campus which hosts the Cape Eleuthera Institute. Ecological design The 10-acre (4-hectare) campus is powered by systems that allow the school to reduce its ecological impact. Rainwater from the roofs is captured for use, and collected into a system of cisterns with 82,000 gallon (310,403 liter) storage capacity. Water is heated through solar thermal collectors. Buildings are designed and constructed from local materials where possible and without air-conditioning. Furniture for the school is hand-crafted on campus out of Casuarina, a local invasive species of tree. The school generates the majority of its electricity through its 29 kW photovoltaic array and 10 kW wind turbine mounted on a 100 ft (30 m) tower above campus. The school seeks to transform its waste outputs through its constructed wetland which captures nutrients, and filters waste water before being used to irrigate landscaping. The school seeks to revolutionize its waste processing through the adaptation of its newly constructed bio-digester which will convert human waste into usable energy. In 2003, a student research group pioneered the biodiesel program which annually transforms 18.000 gallons of waste cooking oil, collected from local restaurants and cruise ships. The biodiesel powers Island School's fleet of 9 boats and 11 vehicles, and backup generators. The school's permaculture, aquaculture, and aquaponics programs, seek to reduce the amount of food imported annually. The school also invests in local agriculture by partnering with farmers to provide locally sourced fruits, vegetables, and meats. Outdoor programs Students undergo PADI Open Water Scuba Certification so that the ocean can become their classroom. They learn about concepts of marine ecology and then interact with knowledge through direct observation of the marine world. Marine Ecology class take place primarily in the ocean, with students diving in order to study these ecological concepts. Students may also be required do dive as part of their coursework in Research classes. All students participate in two expeditions during the course of the semester. The initial three-day kayak trip teaches basic skills of ocean kayaking, camping, team building and serves as an introduction to exploring the island. Later, students complete either a 9-day kayak trip that covers or a 9-day sailing trip to the Exuma Cays. The kayak expedition takes students to the southern point of Eleuthera while further developing students‚Äô kayaking skills and focusing on leadership training. The sailing expedition focuses on group dynamics in the tight quarters of a small sailing vessel, giving students leadership roles throughout the trip. Both expeditions culminate with a 48-hour solo experience in which students are spread out individually in assigned spaces along Lighthouse Beach. Solos are overseen by on-site faculty who support this opportunity for self-discovery.

History The Blue Lias limestone of Aberthaw was a source of hydraulic lime from early times, and it was made famous when it was selected by John Smeaton for the construction of the Eddystone Lighthouse but various records of Aberthaw Blue Lias limestone's processing are not consistent. Evidently, limestone pebbles from Aberthaw's coastline were transported inland for burning at other limekilns but much was shipped across the Bristol Channel from the Port of Aberthaw, for burning at Three Kilns, Cleeve Hill, near Watchet, Somerset. One historical account states that John Smeaton used Watchet's burned lime which was shipped to Millbay, Plymouth for his Eddystone lighthouse construction in 1756. It was not until 1888 that a (pebble) limeworks and kilns, were constructed alongside Pleasant Harbour, East Aberthaw but that works, which had become rail-served by 1892, closed in 1926. It is on record that geologically, the limestone seam at Aberthaw runs under the Bristol Channel and is also present at Watchet. The Aberthaw and Bristol Channel Portland Cement Company was established in 1912 by the Beynon family. The site at Aberthaw was chosen as it was near the necessary raw material, limestone and coal from the South Wales coalfield which was needed to heat the kilns. The works started in 1914 with two small wet process kilns with a production capacity of 120 tonnes per day each. The first consignment of cement left Aberthaw works by rail in 1914. A third wet kiln was ordered in 1913 and erected in 1916 during the first World War, and a fourth kiln was added and running by June 1958. This brought clinker capacity to 1200 tonnes per day. In 1967, Kiln 5 () was installed. This was a much more efficient dry process kiln. The wet process kilns were decommissioned in 1974, and Kiln 6 - also a dry kiln - () was started in 1975. Kiln 6 remains in operation today. In 1919 the company took over the nearby Aberthaw and Rhoose Point Portland and Lime Company. Blue Circle bought the two sites at Aberthaw and Rhoose in 1983. In 1987, Rhoose Works closed and was later completely demolished. The former Rhoose works kiln firing fuel had gone from coal to oil, then gas. The same applied to Aberthaw but reversion to coal came in 1979 but Aberthaw plant was authorised to burn whole tyres as fuel from 2013, with no impact on the environment. Lafarge Cement UK bought Blue Circle industries PLC in 2001, creating the largest cement maker in the world. Cement from the site is carried to destinations by Road and Rail (rail services being provided by Freightliner heavy haul and Colas Rail over the Vale of Glamorgan Line). In July 2020, it was observed that Aberthaw cement in bulk was being shipped in large consignments by PCA rail tank wagons equipped for pressure unloading at destination, thus considerably reducing the number of bulk cement road tankers on the highways. Watercolour artist Thomas Frederick Worrall worked for a few years at the cement works from when it was first opened.See birth certificate of Bessie Worrall: Births in the sub-district of St Nicholas, in the county of Glamorgan no. 360, 1913, showing the occupation of Thomas F.

University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, 1991, p.13. The observatory was installed with a coronagraph in 1940, which had been developed and tested at the Oakridge Station of Harvard College Observatory (it was patterned after one developed by Bernard Lyot in the 1930s in France). At the Harvard College Observatory in Climax (elevation 11,520 feet), Roberts observed and concluded that changes in the corona affected radio communications, and in fact these changes provided advance warning of communication disturbances. This became important for WWII wartime security and the observatory work was classified and overseen by the Navy during this period. In 1945, after WWII, the National Bureau of Standards contracted the observatory for reports on solar activity. In 1946, the Climax Harvard College Observatory incorporated with the University of Colorado under CU President Robert L. Stearns's tenure and was renamed the High Altitude Observatory (HAO).Hallgren, E. L. (1974).

He is director of the research center Canon and Identity Formation in the Earliest Literate Societies under the University of Copenhagen Programme of Excellence (since 2008) and director of The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection & Project (since 1999).Project poster for The Papyrus Carlsberg Collection & Project online PDF online PDF Research One of his most significant publications is a 1997 book titled The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800-1550 B.C.Museum Tuscalanum Press (). Aidan Dodson, a prominent English Egyptologist, calls Ryholt's book \\"fundamental\\" for an understanding of the Second Intermediate PeriodBi Or LVII, January‚ÄìApril 2000, p. 48. This is a review of Ryholt's 463-page book. because it reviews the political history of this period and contains an updated‚Äîand more accurate‚Äîreconstruction of the Turin Canon since the 1959 publication of Alan Gardiner's Royal Canon of Egypt. It also contains an extensive catalogue of all the known monuments, inscriptions and seals for the kings of this period. Ryholt is also a specialist on Demotic papyri and literature and has authored numerous books and articles about this subject. In 2011 he discovered the identity the famous sage king Nechepsos Kim Ryholt, \\"New Light on the Legendary King Nechepsos of Egypt\\", Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 97 (2011), pp. 61-72 online PDF. Since 2013 he directs a project on ancient ink as technology.Project poster for Ancient Ink as Technology online PDF online pdf He has also written a book on antiquities trade with Fredrik Norland Hagen. Second Intermediate Period Ryholt's study makes note of numerous recent archaeological finds including the discovery of a new Hyksos king named Sakir-Har, the find of a doorjamb at Gebel Antef in the mid-1990s which establishes that Sekhemre Shedtawy Sobekemsaf (Sobekemsaf II here) was the father of the 17th Dynasty Theban kings Antef VI and Antef VII. He also discusses Ahmose's Unwetterstele document. The book also argues strongly that the Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt was made up of poorly attested Theban kings such as Nebiriau I, Nebiriau II, Seuserenre Bebiankh and Sekhemre Shedwast who are documented in the last surviving page of the Turin Canon rather than minor Hyksos vassal kings in Lower Egypt, as was generally believed. Among the most significant discussions is Ryholt's evidence that Sekhemre Khutawy Sobekhotep rather than Ugaf was the first king of Egypt's 13th Dynasty,see Appendix A of his book. and a discussion of the foreign origins of the Semitic 13th Dynasty king named Khendjer‚Äîwhose reign lasted a minimum of 4 years and 3 months based on dated workmen's control notes found on stone blocks from his pyramid complex.Ryholt: p. 193. The most controversial conclusion concerns the identity and dating of 14th Dynasty. Ryholt - like Manfred Bietak - argues that it was a forerunner of the 15th Dynasty, but differs in regarding it as contemporary with the 13th Dynasty from the latter's founding around 1800 BC until its collapse in c. 1650/1648 BC. This is contested in review of the book by Daphna Ben Tor and James/Susan Allen.Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 315, 1999, pp. 47-73. Ryholt's proposal that king Sheshi, 'Ammu Ahotepre and Yakbim Sekhaenre were also rulers of the 14th Dynasty is contradicted by Ben Tor's study of the known strata levels of their seals which, in her view, indicate that they date to the second half of the Hyksos 15th Dynasty and are not contemporary with the 13th dynasty. Sheshi, Yakbim and A'amu are more likely to be Hyksos vassal kings in the Delta. Therefore, not all of Ryholt's conclusions have been accepted by Egyptologists. Ryholt has since suggested that Sheshi, one of the best attested kings of the 14th Dynasty, was contemporary with the early 13th Dynasty on the basis of an archaeological deposit at Uronarti where a seal- impression of this king was found together with impressions of two early 13th dynasty Egyptian kings.Ryholt, Kim. \\"The Date of Kings Sheshi and Yaqubhar and the Rise of the Fourteenth Dynasty.\\" The Second Intermediate Period: Current Research, Future Prospects (edited by M. Maree), 2010, OLA 192, pp. 109-126. However, Ben Tor has posited that the context of Maaibre Sheshi seal is not secure and that it was most likely a New Kingdom seal impression.Daphna Ben Tor, The Second Intermediate Period (Thirteenth-Seventeenth Dynasties) Current Research, Future Prospects, (ed: Marcel Maree) 2010, OLA 192, pp. 95. online PDF According to Ben Tor, Reiser reported that \\"two additional seal fragments among the Uronarti sealings, most probably display Eighteenth Dynasty designs.\\"GA Reisner, 1955. 'Clay Sealings of Dynasty XIII from Uronarti Fort, Kush 3, 26-69. This would corroborate the occurrence of 18th dynasty intrusions among the bulk of late Middle Kingdom seals at this site.Ben Tor, 2010, p. 95. The likelihood of New Kingdom intrusions into the Uronarti context \\"was confirmed by Yvonne Markowitz,\\" and also \\"acknowledged by Reisner\\" notes Ben Tor.Ben Tor, 2010, p. 95. Therefore, the Uronarti context is not secure since it bears scarab seals bearing New Kingdom dynasty type which means that the Sheshi seals found there should not be used to date this Asiatic king to the early 13th dynasty. Ben Tor stresses that the use of Second Intermediate Period scarabs for sealing in the Eighteenth Dynasty is attested at Tell el-Dab'a, where a significant number of such examples were recently found in archaeological contexts dating from the reign of Thutmose III.M.

In his teens, he acquired specimens of glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) and snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), which were both later recognised as the first British records. In 1822 and 1823, while completing his medical studies in Edinburgh, Edmondston published several papers in the Memoirs of the Wernerian Society, adding two more species to the British List, Iceland gull (Larus glaucoides) and ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea). Edmondston's publications revealed a careful observer, capable of recognising that several ‚Äòspecies‚Äô recognised at the time were others in juvenile or winter plumages; for example, ‚Äòspeckled diver‚Äô was winter-plumaged red-throated diver (Gavia stellata) and ‚Äòblack-billed auk‚Äô was juvenile razorbill (Alca torda). He was also a pioneer conservationist as, in 1831, he instructed the shepherds on Hermaness on Unst to ensure the safety of the tiny population of breeding great skuas. Edmondston studied medicine at Edinburgh and became the island doctor on Unst, living at Halligarth, where he established a plantation in the late 1830s (trees are scarce in the islands).

He remained curator until his death in 1973.Luke McKernan, ‚ÄòLindgren, Ernest Henry (1910‚Äì1973)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 19 March 2007 He was succeeded by David Francis. Lindgren's approach to the preservation of film materials is often contrasted with that of Henri Langlois, the founder of the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise; the scientific against the romantic.Roger Smither \\"Henri Langlois and Nitrate, Before and After 1959\\" in Smither (ed) This Film is Dangerous: A Celebration of Nitrate Film, Brussels: FIAF, 2002, p.247-55 Unlike Langlois, Lindgren adopted a selective approach in opposition to accumulating every possible film. Along with Langlois though, Lindgren played a major role in the development of FIAF, the International Federation of Film Archives. It is argued that the NFA gained a reputation for being uncooperative in this period, and Lindgren reportedly applied the Alizarin Red test (a disputed means of checking for the extent of nitrate decomposition) to films which were on loan from other institutions. Langlois in contrast had an eccentric, or non-existent, approach to record keeping, and the Cin√©math√®que suffered a nitrate fire on 10 July 1959. Lindgren's approach, on the other hand, meant that no account of changes in fashion could be made. When the BFI published Missing Believed Lost (1992), and launched an accompanying campaign, it was forced to admit that some of the featured titles, all made during the nitrate era, had previously been rejected as possible acquisitions. The Art of the Film: An Introduction to Film Appreciation, first published in 1948, went through several editions during Lindgren's lifetime. A Picture History of the Cinema appeared in 1960.

In 1928, while a Cadet Officer, MacDougall was seconded to the Colonial Office, and posted to Hong Kong. By 1941 he was part of the Ministry of Information (MoI) in Hong Kong. The Chinese Nationalists had worked undercover with the British Police and Intelligence Services since the Japanese invasion of Southern China in 1938, running a network of Nationalist agents which Admiral Chan Chak had operated. These helped in keeping the local Chinese population on-side, controlling the Triad gangs and identifying Japanese sympathisers. During the Battle of Hong Kong he worked directly with Admiral Chan Chak who had been brought in to assist in matters of the Chinese public morale and civil order within the British colony. MacDougall and Chan were among a total of sixty eight British, Chinese and Danish intelligence, naval and marine personnel saved from the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong by a dramatic break-out in five small torpedo boats on Christmas Day 1941. Eventually making it to Chungking, MacDougall then travelled on to Burma. MacDougall was put in charge of the Hong Kong Planning Unit in London in September 1944, charged with preparing for the return of Hong Kong to the UK when the war ended. After Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945 McDougall arrived back in Hong Kong on 7 September 1945 as Chief Civil Affairs Officer with the rank of Brigadier. He had responsibility for Civil Administration, reporting to Admiral Sir Cecil Harcourt who was appointed Commander-in-Chief. MacDougall witnessed the Japanese surrender to Admiral Harcourt in Government House on 16 September. Civilian rule in Hong Kong was reestablished under Governor Sir Mark Young on 1 May 1946 at which time McDougall became Colonial Secretary reporting to Young.

He played for the Wallabies in 13 Tests from 1979 to 1982 and then the Kangaroos in 17 Tests from 1985 to 1990. O'Connor played club football in the NSWRL Premiership for the St. George Dragons from 1983 until 1986, and later the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles from 1987 until his retirement at the end of 1992, becoming captain of Manly in 1990, as well as winning the 1987 Winfield Cup with the Sea Eagles. Rugby union Originally from Canberra he toured with the undefeated Australian Rugby Union Schoolboys tour of Great Britain and France in 1977 alongside the likes of the Ella brothers Mark, Glen and Gary, as well as Queenslanders Wally Lewis and Chris Roche. His club rugby career was with the Canberra Royals and then Brisbane club, Teachers-North's. He was first selected for the Wallabies in 1979. With a number of those players he was a young starter in the 1980 Wallaby side which won the Bledisloe Cup in Sydney in the 3rd and deciding game that year. O'Connor scored a try in this game marking his ascendancy in representative rugby and coinciding with a rebirth of Australian rugby and the beginning of a golden period through to the Grand Slam achievement of 1984. He made 13 Wallaby appearances at Centre up till the July 1982 Test against Scotland. Rugby league St. George 1983‚Äì86 O'Connor switched to rugby league, signing with New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership side, St George in 1983. He made his First Grade d√©but from the bench for the Dragons in Round 3 of the 1983 season against Western Suburbs at Kogarah Oval, scoring a try on debut. O'Connor, who would go on to be a goal kicker of note and would notch up almost 1,500 points in his club and representative career, did not kick a goal for St. George during his first two seasons at the club, with coach Roy Masters preferring Steve Gearin and Steve Rogers in the role (unlike O'Connor who was one of the newer style around-the-corner kickers, Gearin and Rogers were both front on kickers which often led to less accuracy). Following their departure from the club after 1984 (where O'Connor and 24 test veteran Rogers played in the Dragons' Reserve Grade Grand Final side that lost to Balmain),1984 NSWRL Reserve Grade Grand Final highlights O'Connor would be the Dragons first choice goal kicker in 1985, kicking 81 goals on his way to 189 points for the season (also scoring 6 tries and kicking 3 field goals).St George Dragons 1985 O'Connor was part of St. George's 1985 Grand Final team that lost to Canterbury-Bankstown in front of 44,569 at the SCG. O'Connor kicked the only goal for the Dragons, a conversion of a \\"Slippery\\" Steve Morris try as they went down in a thriller 6‚Äì7. A field goal by Bulldogs winger Andrew Farrar being the difference between the two sides. =Representative= O'Connor made his representative d√©but when he was selected for City Firsts for the annual City vs Country game in 1985. After impressing with 3 goals and his general play in City's 18‚Äì12 win over Country Firsts at Newcastle's International Sports Centre. O'Connor was selected to make his State of Origin d√©but for New South Wales in Game 1 of the 1985 State of Origin series. Heavy rain confronted the players at Lang Park when the teams took the field for the opening match of the series. O'Connor scored two tries and kicking five goals to finish with all 18 of the Blue's points. A week before he was selected for NSW for the first time, O'Connor was hit in an accidental high tackle from Canterbury-Bankstown's Steve Mortimer in a club match at Belmore, leaving him with a broken nose (and contributing to his nickname of \\"Snoz\\"). The Bulldogs half-back was cited over the incident but received support from O'Connor at the league judiciary when he concurred with Mortimer's explanation that his arm had come up from off the ball when he made the tackle and that there was no intent of a high shot. During Game 2 of the 1985 State of Origin series at the Sydney Cricket Ground, O'Connor kicked 4 goals and his only field goal in Origin football as NSW won 21‚Äì14 in front of the then biggest crowd in Origin history of 39,068 fans. Following his performances for NSW in the first two games of the 1985 Origin series, O'Connor was selected for the mid-season tour of New Zealand. Though he didn't play in a test match, he did play in the minor games of the short tour. Controversy reigned in early 1987 following the release of a biography of Australian and Queensland captain Wally Lewis titled \\"King Wally\\" when 1985 NSW and Australian coach Terry Fearnley had been quoted as allegedly saying about O'Connor during the 1985 tour \\"Can't play. No Heart. Lucky he can kick goals or he wouldn't be here\\". O'Connor's international rugby league d√©but in the first test of the mid-season Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand on 6 July 1986 at Auckland's Carlaw Park saw him become Australia's 37th dual code rugby international following Ray Price and preceding Ricky Stuart. Playing on the , Snoz kicked 3 goals in a 22-8 Australian win. He then went on to kick 4 goals as Australia wrapped up the two match series 2‚Äì0 with a 29‚Äì12 win at the SCG. With his natural pace and great side-step, many of his international rugby league appearances were on the wing, such was the depth of Australia's three-quarter talent with players like Gene Miles, Brett Kenny, Mal Meninga, Dale Shearer, Tony Currie, Andrew Ettingshausen and Mark McGaw available to the selectors during his era, though he did play most of his State of Origin career in his preferred centre position. O'Connor was a selection for the 1986 Kangaroo Tour and played in all 6 tests on tour (including the pre-tour test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby, where he scored 22 points from 2 tries and 7 goals in a 62‚Äì12 win). He was the leading point scorer on tour for the Kangaroos with 170 from 13 tries and 59 goals from his 14 games played. O'Connor scored a personal tally of 44 points in the 3-0 Ashes series victory over Great Britain, including 22 in the first test at Old Trafford where he scored 3 tries and kicked 5/9 goals in tricky conditions. He then played the final two tests on tour against a hapless French side, scoring 20 points (3 tries, 4 goals) in the 44-2 first test win at Perpignan and 16 points (1 try, 6 goals) in the 52-0 second test win at Carcassonne. Manly-Warringah 1987-92 Before the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, O'Connor signed with the Bob Fulton-coached Manly-Warringah club. O'Connor started playing for Manly from 1987 and starred in their 18-8 1987 NSWRL season's Grand Final win over the Canberra Raiders O'Connor scored 14 of Manly's 18 points with a try in the second half (and a perfect 5/5 goal kicking. Following the 1987 grand final victory he travelled with the champion Manly side to England for the 1987 World Club Challenge against the 1986‚Äì87 RFL champions, Wigan at their home ground, Central Park. In front of 36,895, Wigan won an ultimately try-less game 8‚Äì2, with Manly's only points coming from a penalty goal from O'Connor. Despite being Manly's first choice kicker for the Grand Final, O'Connor generally shared the kicking duties with Mal Cochrane and only scored 129 points for the season in 21 games (Cochrane scored 138 from 25 games). At the end of the 1992 Winfield Cup season, as captain of Manly, O'Connor announced his retirement from playing. O'Connor was rated the 50th best Australian rugby league footballer of all time in a Rugby League Week Special in 1992. =Representative= During 1987, O'Connor played both in the centres and on the wing for New South Wales in their 2-1 State of Origin series loss to Queensland where he scored 2 tries and kicked 5 goals for the series. He was then selected to play on the wing in Australia's 13‚Äì6 loss to New Zealand in the one-off test at Lang Park. In 1987, there was a 4th 'Exhibition' State of Origin game played in August. This game was played in Long Beach, California at the Veterans Memorial Stadium. Playing in the centres, O'Connor scored 1 try and kicked 5 goals for the Blues who won convincingly 30‚Äì10. O'Connor scored tries in all three matches of the 1988 State of Origin series, which Queensland won 3-0 for the first time, despite two of the three games being played in Sydney. On 20 July 1988 O'Connor played on the wing for Australia in their record 62-point win over Papua New Guinea, scoring four tries and kicking 7 goals to set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league. Of his 18 tests, O'Connor only played three games at centre, all three during the 1988 Ashes series against the Great Britain Lions following the international retirement of Kenny, and the unavailability of both Miles and Meninga with injury. He was then chosen at centre for the Ashes series against the touring Great Britain side, the Australians winning the series 2‚Äì1. Following the end of the 1988 season in which Manly were bundled out in the semi-finals, O'Connor and Dale Shearer were the only Manly players chosen for Australia's World Cup Final team to play New Zealand at Eden Park in Auckland. O'Connor (playing on the wing) kicked 4/7 goals as Australia won 25-12 to win their 5th Rugby League World Cup. During the 1989 NSWRL season, O'Connor was selected for Game 3 of the 1989 State of Origin series, which saw Qld record its second straight 3-0 series win, and 8th straight game win in a row, with a 36‚Äì16 win at Lang Park. Following this he was selected for Australia's mid-season tour of New Zealand where he played in all three Trans-Tasman Tests against the Kiwis as the Bob Fulton coached Aussies won 3‚Äì0. O'Connor's last test for Australia was in 1990. Playing on the wing on a freezing night at the Pioneer Oval in Parkes (NSW), O'Connor, as did the other Australian goal kickers used (captain Mal Meninga, an on d√©but Laurie Daley, and former Manly teammate Dale Shearer), had an off-night with the boot, missing all three of his conversion attempts. Injury then ruled him out of the test against New Zealand in Wellington two months later. Following the 1990 NSWRL season, in which he had taken over the captaincy of the Sea Eagles following Paul Vautin's move to Eastern Suburbs, O'Connor ruled himself out of contention for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour because of a recurring hamstring injury. O'Connor is remembered in State of Origin folklore for a sideline conversion for NSW in teeming rain only minutes out from the final siren to win the 2nd game of the 1991 State of Origin series 14‚Äì12 win over Qld at the Sydney Football Stadium. Despite no longer being the regular kicker for Manly due to the signing of goal kicking former All Blacks fullback Matthew Ridge, and despite the presence in the NSW team of regular club kickers Greg Alexander (Penrith) and Rod Wishart (Illawarra), Blues coach Tim Sheens gave the kicking duties to O'Connor for the series and his lack of match kicking practice showed, kicking only 3/9 for the series, all three goals coming in Game 2 in Sydney. The 1991 Origin series was the last time Michael O'Connor represented NSW. During the third and final game of the 1991 State of Origin series, O'Connor was hit in a high tackle from Queensland centre Mal Meninga in the sixth minute, leaving him with a broken nose and two black eyes. Despite the riot act being read to both teams after a fiery Game 2, the NSWRL failed to cite Meninga for the incident and O'Connor was forced to accept an apology from him (at the time Meninga was the reigning Australian captain and there was the Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand starting a month later). St Helens O'Connor and Manly captain Paul Vautin travelled to England to play for the Alex Murphy coached St. Helens for a short spell during 1988‚Äì89, but his performances were largely disappointing, culminating in the side's 27‚Äì0 1989 Challenge Cup Final defeat at Wembley Stadium against Wigan. It was the first time in Cup Final history that a team had been held scoreless. O'Connor took Dave Tanner's place from the side that had played in the 16‚Äì14 Semi-final victory over Widnes. Post playing career O'Connor served as head coach of the Australian men rugby sevens team from 2008 to 2014.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/25/michael-oconnor-steps-down- as-australia-sevens-coach He coached the team to a silver medal at the Rugby sevens at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

Life  In 1940, as soon as France was occupied by the German army, Savary enlisted in the Resistance. He organized the rallying of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon to the Free French Forces and became its governor. After the war, he participated in the restoring of the Republican State. A member of the French Section of the Workers' International (Socialist Party, SFIO) he was deputy for Saint-Pierre et Miquelon throughout most of the Fourth Republic, from 1944 to 1946 and from 1951 to 1958. In 1956, he was nominated Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Guy Mollet's cabinet, but resigned due to his opposition to the repressive policy of Mollet in Algerian War (1954‚Äì62) and to the arrest of Ahmed Ben Bella. He left the SFIO in 1958, because of the party's support for Charles de Gaulle's comeback and for the new Constitution elaborating a presidential regime (the Fifth Republic). With Pierre Mend√®s-France, he founded the dissident Autonomous Socialist Party (PSA) which became, in 1960, the Unified Socialist Party (PSU). However, he left it in 1967 and founded the Union of Clubs for the Renewal of the Left, which joined the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left (FGDS) which had supported left-wing candidate Fran√ßois Mitterrand at the 1965 presidential election. Then, he returned to the \\"old socialist house\\" when it was replaced by the Socialist Party (PS). In the PS Reconciled with Guy Mollet, Savary succeeded him to the leadership of the party in 1969. As First Secretary of the PS, he promised to begin an \\"ideological dialogue\\" with the French Communist Party (PCF), which was the largest left-wing party in France at the time. He was faced with growing pressure from internal opponents insisted that he remain dependent on Mollet's followers and not to pursue the \\"renewal\\" of the party. Two years later, during the Epinay Congress, he was removed by Fran√ßois Mitterrand, who proposed an alliance with the Communists based on a Common Program. Savary became a Deputy for Haute Garonne in 1973. In 1981 he became Minister of National Education under President Fran√ßois Mitterrand. As minister of education, Savary appointed a series of charges de missions and study commissions to survey problems and propose possible remedies in a variety of areas: the Jeantet Commission on higher education, the Prost Coommissin on the lycees, the Legrand Commission on the colleges, Bertrand Schwartz on the educational and employment problems of 16- to 18-year-olds, Andre Peretti on training of elementary and secondary school teachers, Jean-Louis Quermonne on the status of teachers in higher education, and Laurent Schwartz and the Commission du Bilan on the educational system as a whole.The French Socialist Experiment (1985) By John S. Ambler In June 1984, Mitterrand decided to withdraw the \\"Savary Bill\\" to limit the financing of private schools due to large demonstrations by the supporters of private schools.

She began to perform regularly towards the end of the 1980s with this style. Her first album, Person 2 Person, was released in 1992, produced by Martin Kantola. √Östr√∂m's musical career got a boost when she was invited to perform at the Christian Artists Seminar in the Netherlands in 1992.

Aan't Goor was then the main lyric writer for √Östr√∂m's compositions up until 2003. During these years √Östr√∂m collaborated with Luca Genta, Ralph van Manen, Buddy Miller, Julie Miller and Phil Keaggy, to name a few.

He commanded the Nassau infantry brigade at the Battle of Waterloo. In his retirement, he experimented in new farming and cattle breeding techniques on a small acreage given to him by the Duke of Nassau, exploring the problems in raising healthy cattle. Family and military career August von Kruse was born in Wiesbaden in 1779. His father, Karl Friedrich von Kruse (1737‚Äì1806), a state official in the service of Nassau-Usingen, wrote several books on husbandry and household management, including Lehrbegriffs der Landwirtschaft und Haushaltungskunste for the Naussau schools in 1780, and Wahren Darstellung der grossen franz√∂sichen Staatsrevolutions in 1790, which entered into several printings.Verein f√ºr Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichte.

Against the wishes of his father, at the age of 17 he joined the military. For seven years he served in the military of the Prince of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. On 1 July 1803, he accepted a commission as a captain in the Nassau-Weilburg military. At that time, the army of the principality consisted of two companies. With the merger of the principality of Nassau Weilburg with Nassau, the army expanded considerably, and Kruse received the rank of major. As a client state of France, Nassau supported Napoleon in the Prussian campaign of 1806. By the end of the campaign, Kruse had been promoted to lieutenant colonel. In the summer of 1808, Kruse commanded the 2nd Nassau Infantry Regiment No. 88, and fought for the French in the Peninsular War. On 13 October 1808, the regiment crossed the Spanish border. The Nasssauers participated in 42 battles, including the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June 1813. On 10 December 1813, as Napoleon's empire crumbled in northern Europe, Kruse received secret orders from the Duke and the Prince of Orange to join the British.Mark Edward Hay, The L√©gion Hollandaise d'Orange.

Awards von Kruse's decorations included the Grand Cross with Diamonds of the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, the Legion of Honour, Nassau's silver Waterloo Medal, and the insignia of a Knight of the Royal Netherlands Military Willems-Order. As a reward for his service, in 1822 the Duke gave Kruse received a farm by Eisenbach, in the Taunus. On this farm, he experimented with new methods of construction and cattle breeding, and published his findings, which formed the basis of new practices in farm management. He also experimented in the development of social networks to alleviate widespread suffering, such as alcohol abuse.

Early life Nikolay Belelyubsky was born on 1 (13) March 1845 in Kharkiv to a Russian noble family descended from the 16th century. He spent his childhood and youth in Taganrog and graduated with a gold medal from the Taganrog Boys Gymnasium in 1862. In that year he entered the Institute of Transport (today the St. Petersburg State Transport University, from which he was graduated in 1867. Belelyubski was considered to be one of the Institute's greatest graduates, and after graduation he remained at the institute as a private tutor. In 1873 he was appointed Extraordinary Professor in the Department for Building Materials, and three years later he already held the position of Full Professor. He gained international recognition for his research and practice in the fields of bridge engineering and building materials. In 1881 Belelyubsky was named a member of the Engineering Council of the Ministry of Transport Communications.St. Petersburg Encyclopedia (online), entry \\"Belelyubsky N.A.\\" http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804012606?lc=en Bridge builder Belelyubsky personally designed and managed over 100 projects of long bridges. The total length of the bridges constructed upon his projects extended . These include the bridges over the rivers Don, Danube, Volga, Ob, Kama, Oka, Neva, Irtysh, Belaya, Ufa, Neman, Berezina, and many others. In 1875 Belelyubsky designed the Alexander Railway Bridge in association with Vladimir Ilyich Berezin and Konstantin Yakovlevich Mikhailovsky. It was built on the Samara-Zlatoust Railway on the Volga near Syzran. Working on this project, Belelyubsky developed a method for analysis of waterway openings for large bridges, which later came to be widely acknowledged. Completed in 1880, this bridge was the longest in Europe with a total length of : its superstructure system had 13 spans, each long. The bridge connected the railroad network in the central Russia with Volga region and, later, Siberia and Turkestan. The construction works involved approximately 2,500 thousand people, required more than 10 thousand cubic metres of masonries and approximately 6,5 tons of iron, and what is more, Belelyubsky personally obtained iron from Belgium, demanding metal of the highest quality. (In 2004, the original spans were replaced with contemporary ones.) Amur Bridge (1884), Dnipro, Ukraine 200 px In the period from 1881 to 1884, a two-level rail bridge across the Dnieper in Ekaterinoslav was built under the supervision of Belelyubsky. The lower level was for trains only, while the upper level was designed for wagon traffic. The length of the bridge was . (The bridge was thoroughly renovated in the period of the 1930s to 1950s.)400 px While he was designing the rail bridges over the Volga river near Tver in 1885 and the Belaya River in Ufa in 1886, Belelyubsky developed and introduced a new technology: the transverse floor-beams were connected to the bottom chords of trusses by means of hinged \\"distance blocks\\". Such a type of structural support was considered to be ground-breaking in the days of Belelyubsky, as it allowed the reduction of secondary stresses in trusses. At the Edinburgh Exposition of 1890 this design received the gold medal and later came to be known abroad as the \\"Russian support method\\".Civil engineers of the Great Siberian railway\\". http://archive.yourmuseum.ru/project/sib- foto/transsib/prolet/ingq.htm From 1893 to 1897 Belelyubsky was in charge of constructing of the railway bridge across the Ob River near Novonikolaevsky (now Novosibirsk). It was the first of the grand bridges of the Great Siberian Way, connecting the two largest segments of the Trans-Siberian Railway ‚Äï the West Siberian and Middle Siberian railways. The bridge was for the first time equipped with spans which were topped by metal structures of the cantilever- beam type, while the bridge itself was the largest structure of the West Siberian Railway. The bridge commission headed by Belelyubsky tested the bridge on 28 March (9 April) 1897 by placing 4 locomotives, each of 51.5 tons, simultaneously on the structure. The bridge was opened for service on 5 (17) April 1897\\"Construction of railway bridge across Ob River\\". http://archive.yourmuseum.ru/project/sib-foto/transsib/prolet/obmq.htm\\"West Siberian Railways\\". eng.rzd.ru/statice/public/en?STRUCTURE_ID=4332&layer;_id=4516&refererLayerId;=4516&id;=2550 The apogee of his engineering career was the Romanovsky rail bridge, which was built in 1909-1913 across the Volga river near Zelenodolsk; It was renamed Red Bridge after the October revolution of 1917. Its oval openwork lattice spans amounted to (a similar model was replicated for the bridge in Simbirsk). Due to their extension, the designer was able to reduce the number of spans (six large and two small). It was opened for traffic on July 11, 1913, and has served the people well. (In the period 2006-2011, the original spans were replaced with new structures.) His last major project was the Don Bridge at Rostov-on-Don, built in 1912-1917, which he designed in association with G.P. Peredery and S. Belzetsky.\\"North Caucasus Railways\\". http://eng.rzd.ru/statice/public/en?STRUCTURE_ID=4332&layer;_id=4516&refererLayerId;=4516&id;=2560 Belelyubsky developed a method to build caissons in the construction of bridge piers, which later came to be called the \\"caisson-slipper\\" method. Additionally, he engaged in tests of building materials, especially reinforced concrete.The Middle Siberian Railway was crossed by a ferroconcrete bridge at the 1919-verst mark. http://archive.yourmuseum.ru/project/sib- foto/transsib/railway2q.htm Belelyubsky tried to help Russian science move forward, representing his country at many international railway exhibitions and forums. His bridge models were exhibited at several world expositions, including Paris in 1878, 1889 and 1900, Edinburgh in 1890, and Chicago in 1893. He attained the Russian civil rank of Active State Councillor, and his international recognition included an honorary doctorate from the Technical University of Berlin in 1907, an honorary membership in the Arkitechten- und Ingenieur-Verein zu Berlin in 1909 and an honorary membership in the French Society of Civil Engineers.\\"Civil engineers of the Great Siberian railway\\", op. cit. He was also a member of the International Association of Railroad Congresses and an honorary member of the Institute of Concrete in England. In St. Petersburg he lived for a number of years at 4 Serpukhovskaya Street, moving in 1910 to 14a Bronnitskaya Street.St. Petersburg Encyclopedia (online), entry \\"Belelyubsky N.A.\\", op. cit. Nikolay Belelyubsky died on August 4, 1922 in Saint Petersburg, and was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery. According to the testimony of contemporaries, Belelyubsky was a man of high culture and internal content. Modesty, devotion and material unselfishness were main personality traits of the founder of the Russian school of bridge building and the \\"poet\\" of bridge engineering. Even so, the outstanding scientist was considered to be a poor and oddish man, according to the standards of the society he lived in. But Belelyubsky himself never suffered emotionally from this. He preferred spiritual values to material goods, while serving the people was the greatest happiness for him.

In addition to the Institute of Transport, he also lectured at the Mining Institute, the Institute of Civil Engineers, the Imperial Academy of Arts and Women's Polytechnic courses. And his work \\"The Course of Structural Mechanics\\" (1885) became the most popular textbook for students and a reference book for many engineers. He used to tell his students: > \\"You are future engineers. What could be better? You will design and build > bridges. Bridges are built to last for a hundred years or more.

Between 1937 and 1939 Wolfe occasionally worked in the Merchant Marines.Geduld In 1939 he moved to Greenwich Village, where he eventually drifted away from the Trotskyite movement and met Anais Nin and Henry Miller.Alan M. Wald Through them he found employment writing pornographic novels (11 in 11 months) for the private collection of Roy Melisander Johnson, an Oklahoma oil millionaire. He credited his pornographic output with teaching him to write to specified lengths while facing deadlines: ‚ÄúI acquired the work discipline of a professional writer, capable of a solid daily output.‚Äù In 1941 he was the assistant night editor for Paramount Newsreel for a few weeks. In 1943 and 1944 he wrote war-related science articles for Popular Science Monthly and Mechanix Illustrated. He eventually became the editor of the latter magazine. In 1946 he collaborated with the jazz musician Mezz Mezzrow in writing Mezzrow's autobiography, Really the Blues. The book was a popular success, introducing the mass audience to aspects of black culture. It received a flattering notice in Billy Rose's syndicated column in October of that year and in 1947 Wolfe was hired as ghost writer for Billy Rose‚Äôs syndicated column. Wolfe worked on a further study of \\"negro\\" culture in America, which was never published, but excerpts were published in American magazines in 1949 and 1950, translated for Jean- Paul Sartre‚Äôs Les Temps modernes and quoted by Frantz Fanon .Scott Saul In 1950 he had psychoanalysis with Dr. Edmund Bergler. Wolfe would return in his fiction to Bergler‚Äôs idea of ‚Äúpsychic masochism‚Äù. Bergler's ideas of frigidity and the importance of the vaginal orgasm recur in Wolfe's presentation of female sexuality. In 1951 he published a short story, \\"Self-Portrait\\", in Galaxy. Its themes of cybernetics, artificial limbs and prostheses, computerised warfare, masochism and voluntary amputeeism would all be expanded upon in his first published novel, Limbo (1952). Because the novel was set in the then-distant future of 1990, the original British edition is entitled Limbo '90. The publisher claimed that Wolfe had written \\"the first book of science-fiction to project the present-day concept of 'cybernetics' to its logical conclusion\\".Jacket notes for Wolfe, B. (1961), \\"Limbo '90\\", Penguin. David Pringle selected Limbo for inclusion in his book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. J.G. Ballard praised Wolfe's \\"lucid intelligence\\" and claimed Limbo helped encourage him to start writing fiction.Ballard, J. G. (1984). \\"From Shanghai to Shepperton\\". Re/Search 8/9, pp. 112‚Äì124. Boucher and McComas, however, received the novel poorly, calling it \\"pretentious hodgepodge\\" and describing its theme as \\"a symbolically interesting idea . . . never developed with consistent or convincing details.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, February 1953, p. 73. P. Schuyler Miller gave Limbo a mixed review, describing it as a \\"colossus of a novel\\" while faulting its \\"endless talk.\\"\\"The Reference Library,\\" Astounding Science Fiction, January 1954, pp. 149‚Äì150. His novel The Late Risers, Their Masquerade (1954), the title of which plays on Herman Melville‚Äôs The Confidence-man: His Masquerade, is about the hustlers, actors and drug dealers who people late-night New York City. In 1955 and 1956 he wrote a number of television plays, some of which drew upon his experiences with Trotsky and as a ghost writer. His 1956 teleplay Five Who Shook the Mighty, a dramatization of the trial of five Romanians who had captured the Romanian Communist legation in Switzerland (the Berne incident), was the subject of protests by the Romanian embassy but was given a special award by the Crusade for Freedom. He wrote a monthly column in 1957 for Nugget, a men's magazine. His third novel, In Deep (1957), is a thriller featuring espionage, socialist hipsters and decades-old Communist vendettas played out in Cuba. The Great Prince Died (later republished as Trotsky Dead) (1959) was a roman a clef about the events surrounding the assassination of Trotsky (called Victor Rostov in the novel). The book was well received by critics and reviewers, though many expressed doubts about the mixture of fact and fiction in the book. Trotskyites were highly critical of the book, particularly of Wolfe's theme that Trotsky's guilt about the Kronstadt rebellion was transformed into a masochistic death wish. A partial dramatization of The Great Prince Died on Turnley Walker's 1959 book program First Meeting was instrumental in bringing Wolfe to live in California.Ellison, Harlan (1974). \\"Who's Been Keeping This Wolfe from Our Door\\". Los Angeles Times, 10 November. The Magic of Their Singing (1961) is another novel about New York City's counterculture, as university graduate Hoyt Fairliss explores the world of the beats and nonconformists. In 1960 he began publishing stories in Playboy magazine, which paid him a retainer for a first option on his short work.Gregory Feeley \\"Bernard Wolfe and the Novel of the Fifties,\\" AB Bookman‚Äôs Weekly 3 August 1998 In 1961 it was announced that Wolfe was writing an (unproduced) screenplay for Tony Curtis about Hugh Hefner and Playboy magazine. In 1963 it was announced that Wolfe was writing the (unproduced) screenplay adaptation of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer. Come On Out, Daddy was published in 1963, an expansion of bitter stories recently published in Playboy and Cavalier (as Andrew Foxe) about Gordon Rengs, a novelist and screenwriter, and his tawdry adventures in Hollywood. A short story collection, Move Up, Dress Up, Drink Up, Burn Up was published in 1968. In the late 1960s he taught at UCLA. Harlan Ellison solicited two stories (\\"The Girl with Rapid Eye Movements\\", about Gordon Rengs and the generation gap) to appear in his 1972 science fiction anthology, Again, Dangerous Visions. Wolfe wrote an autobiography, Memoirs of a Not Altogether Shy Pornographer (1972), the title of which alludes to Kenneth Patchen‚Äôs Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer. His novel Logan‚Äôs Gone (1974), a return to the character of Gordon Rengs, features contemporary politics with campus protests and Vietnam veterans. In 1974 Wolfe signed a seven-book contract with a recently formed Los Angeles publisher, Wollstonecraft Inc. Unfortunately the publisher suffered financial troubles, and Wolfe published no books after this. It remains uncertain whether several books may or may not have been printed, particularly because of variant titles used in a 1974 Publisher‚Äôs Weekly article. The Great Prince Died was republished with emendations as Trotsky Dead. A novel entitled Full Disclosure and advertised to appear in 1975 as an ‚Äúinternational suspense novel highlighting moral conflicts among the men who hold the keys to government secrets‚Äù may be the Watergate‚Äìinspired novel Lies, whose publication corresponds with Wollstonecraft's 1975 schedule, about an undercover government agent whose marriage falters as does his faith in the work he does. Julie: The Life and Times of John Garfield (or Body and Soul: The Life and Death of John Garfield), a biography of the actor by Wolfe and Edward Medard was advertised in several trade journals throughout 1975 and 1977 but its publication is uncertain. A novel, Blood Money, and a collection of essays and reviews, Men Not Quite Without Women, were never published. In 1975 he collaborated with Michael Blankfort on a play, Karl and Arthur, about Karl Marx and Arthur Rimbaud. Throughout the 1970s articles and profiles Harlan Ellison, 1972Larry Grobel \\"Bernard Wolfe: The Writer as Hero,\\" Los Angeles Free Press 12 September 1975 noted a lengthy novel that Wolfe was writing about the Delano grape strike. In 1969 Wolfe had conducted a series of UCLA lectures on the proletarian novel, and the Delano grape strike had been employed as background in several of the stories in Move Up, Dress Up, Drink Up, Burn Up.

Robert Bosch fulfilled a long-cherished wish in 1936 on the occasion of his 75th birthday and the 50th jubilee of his company: he donated a hospital to the city of Stuttgart. The Original hospital with its 360 beds opened in April 1940 and was replaced by a new building at a near-by location in 1973. The hospital is supported by the Robert Bosch Stiftung (Robert Bosch Foundation). The Foundation and the managing board of the Hospital determine the strategic development of the medical, therapeutic and nursing care. The Foundation enables medical research and funds necessary investments which are not met from other sources. The Foundation guarantees that Robert Bosch‚Äôs objective of high quality care for patients is realised in his hospital. Since 1978, the Robert-Bosch-Hospital has been part of the teaching hospital of the University of T√ºbingen. The Robert-Bosch-Hospital, including Schillerh√∂he and gynaecological hospital Charlottenhaus since January, 2006, disposes of more than 771 beds for acute care, 100 beds for geriatric rehabilitation, including 20 therapy places in day hospital, and 15 therapy places in the psychosomatic day hospital. The Robert-Bosch-Hospital admits approximately 32,000 in-patients a year. The centres for internal, operational and diagnostic medicine are part of the Hospital as well as a centre for pneumology and thorax surgery. Besides research institutes in clinical pharmacology and history of medicine, other institutions such as an interdisciplinary centre of tumour therapy, a breast centre, a school of nursing and centres for further education are associated with the Hospital.

His distinct piano style has been noted to reveal Jazz fusion and Classical music influences. While being an internationally respected drummer, he is essentially self-taught, though he picked up casual lessons with various professional players at a young age and later spent a lengthier term with drum teacher Geoff Myers. Having been a professional player on drums and piano from the age of 13 he joined The Syd Lawrence Orchestra at 16 as their full-time drummer. In addition to this he picked up session or touring work with artists or acts such as Lulu and The Bachelors among many others. Husband also frequently played in his home town with visiting jazz soloists from London in pubs and music venues. Upon a move to London at the age of 18, Husband held either the piano or drums chair in groups such as Mike Carr Trio, Barbara Thompson's Paraphernalia, Gary Boyle Trio, the Morrissey‚ÄìMullen band, Jeff Clyne's Turning Point, occasionally recording with the BBC Big Band and frequently picking up freelance work performing at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club.

Among his more recent projects was Dirty & Beautiful,The Guardian review Gary Husband - \\"Dirty & Beautiful\\" an album project in two volumes featuring performances from himself together with many of his friends and musical collaborators, past and present. Guitarists Allan Holdsworth, Neil Taylor (guitarist), Steve Topping, John McLaughlin, Wayne Krantz, Robin Trower, Ray Russell, Steve Hackett, Mike Stern, Alex Machacek and Jimmy Herring appear, along with bassists Jimmy Johnson (bassist), Mark King, Laurence Cottle and keyboardist Jan Hammer. Husband produced a piano and electric guitar duet album with Alex Machacek in 2013 for Abstractlogix entitled NOW. In July 2013 Gary Husband performed a solo piano concert at the Saint-√âmilion Jazz Festival. In May 2017 Husband took his first big band production (\\"Dreams In Blue\\") to the Norddeutscher Rundfunk Big Band. Consisting of mostly his own material Husband enlisted composer and arranger Dale Wilson to prepare and interpret the scores, while Tim Hagans was brought in to direct the band. The production featured Husband playing both piano and drums. Gary also integrated special guest (Hungarian violinist) Zolt√°n Lantos for the debut concert performance in Hamburg.  Educational  In 1997 Rittor Music Japan released the semi-educational video Gary Husband * Interplay & Improvisation On The Drums. Husband is an internationally respected drum clinician and has performed over the years in this capacity alongside Ricky Lawson, Omar Hakim, Dennis Chambers, Vinnie Colaiuta, Denny Seiwell, Todd Sucherman, Paul Wertico, Terry Bozzio, Simon Phillips and Billy Cobham among many others. He has held a masterclass at the Drummers Collective in N.Y.C., and is a patron and visiting artist at Tech Music School in London. Husband runs his own motivational and educational drum method course The Gary Husband Drum Videocasts Series from his own website.  Affiliations with others   Allan Holdsworth  A chance meeting with the influential guitarist Allan Holdsworth and bassist Jack Bruce in 1979, (while Husband was fulfilling his last engagement with saxophonist Barbara Thompson at Ronnie Scott's Club) resulted in a casual jam session. Soon after, Holdsworth, along with Husband, formed Holdsworth & Co (later to be renamed False Alarm, and eventually Allan Holdsworth I.O.U.), and eventually found their bass player in Paul Carmichael, also adding vocalist Paul Williams. The group's hugely influential I.O.U. album was recorded soon after, although not released until 1982, upon the band's moderately successful launch in America. In the decades since then, Husband has internationally toured and recorded with Holdsworth prolifically, through many different group personnel lineups. The association, featuring Jimmy Johnson (bassist), continued until Holdsworth's passing in April 2017 and is regarded by Husband as the most significant of his career. As well as drums, Husband contributed keyboard parts for some tracks on two Holdsworth albums: 'Secrets' and Wardenclyffe Tower. For the former, Husband composed the composition \\"City Nights\\" on which he plays keyboards and the drummer is Vinnie Colaiuta.  John McLaughlin  Gary Husband was recruited by John McLaughlin in April 2005 to play keyboards in a formation called John McLaughlin & Friends for a concert in R√©union Island. Soon after, he performed keyboards and drums on McLaughlin's Industrial Zen album. The regularly touring and recording band John McLaughlin & The 4th Dimension was then formed with Husband featured on both his instruments, bassist Hadrien Feraud and drummer Mark Mondesir. Following the departure of Feraud, (and after a short spell with bassist Dominique Di Piazza in his place) √âtienne M'Bapp√© joined the group and McLaughlin recorded the highly acclaimed, Grammy-nominated 2010 album To the One with the new lineup, on which Husband was also featured as principal drummer (on two tracks) as well as the keyboardist throughout. Drummer Ranjit Barot later replaced Mark Mondesir in the drum chair (leaving Husband as the only remaining originally recruited member), and the new 2011 version of the group recorded the album Now Here This, which was released in Autumn 2012. In 2007 Husband performed with the John McLaughlin Band (along with Matthew Garrison on bass and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums) at Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago. Husband's composition \\"Sulley\\" has long been a popular inclusion to the 4th Dimension's live repertoire, and features on the group's 2009 live DVD in Belgrade. On 7 October 2013, Husband and John McLaughlin performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as a duet. Following the performance, the Paul Reed Smith guitar McLaughlin played was presented to the museum by its maker.  Billy Cobham  In 1992 Gary Husband joined legendary drummer Billy Cobham's regular touring band playing keyboards and second drum kit. Soon after, he recorded on Cobham's The Traveler album, and to date Husband is still the only additional drummer to have performed a drums duet with the former Mahavishnu Orchestra drummer on one of his own recordings. In 1995 the Billy Cobham International Quartet (featuring Husband, bassist Kai Eckhardt and guitarist Peter Wolpl) toured North America and Canada. Other notable touring or recording periods with Cobham include the 1998 Billy Cobham (featuring Randy Brecker) Quintet, (with which Husband recorded the album Focused) and the 2002 U.S.A. \\"Spectrum\\" 30th Anniversary Tour, along with bassist Leland Sklar and guitarist Dean Brown (guitarist). Husband also toured with Cobham's Higher Ground, North By Northwest and Culture Mix bands, recording the album Culture Mix with the latter. Husband's compositions \\"Le Coco\\", \\"Blue Dreams\\" and \\"Avatar\\" were performed by Cobham's groups during these periods. In early 2013 Husband was recruited again as keyboardist and contributing composer for Cobham's 40th \\"Spectrum\\" Anniversary U.S. tour, along with guitarist Dean Brown, violinist Jerry Goodman and bassist Ric Fierabracci. In September and October of the same year, the group (now known as Billy Cobham Spectrum 40) returned to the U.S.A., Canada and Europe (minus Jerry Goodman) and performed further touring. Husband's pieces \\"If The Animals Had Guns Too\\" and \\"Dreams In Blue\\" were featured compositions on these tours. The album \\"Billy Cobham's Spectrum 40 Live\\" was released in 2015 and consisted of recorded material from the band's 2013 international touring activity. Husband left the group in May 2015.  Jack Bruce  In April 1992 Husband performed a benefit concert in London with Jack Bruce alongside guitarist Clem Clempson and keyboardist Ronnie Leahy, marking the beginning of a new working relationship with the ex-Cream bassist and singer. In 1993 Husband toured North America and Europe with Bruce along with guitarist Blues Saraceno and performed at the ‚ÄòJack Bruce 50th Birthday Concerts‚Äô in Cologne (playing drums and piano) along with Clem Clempson, Ginger Baker, Gary 'Mudbone' Cooper, Gary Moore, Pete Brown, Dick Heckstall-Smith, Bernie Worrell, Simon Phillips, Kip Hanrahan and others. The events were both filmed and released on audio CD by CMP Records. Husband and Bruce recorded two tracks on Gary Moore's Ballads & Blues 1982‚Äì1994 album in 1994, and the three had been working as a regularly performing power trio. This line-up was the original blueprint for the group which was to become BBM (Bruce-Baker-Moore) which Husband missed due to touring commitments with Billy Cobham. Ginger Baker was recruited in his place, and since, Husband has also worked regularly in a trio format with Bruce alongside guitarist Clem Clempson.  Jack Bruce / Robin Trower / Gary Husband  In 2007 Jack Bruce again joined forces with the guitarist Robin Trower for a third recording together. Husband was enlisted for the new studio album, named Seven Moons. A new three-piece was established as a result of the group's successful chemistry and the trio toured extensively through Europe together, later releasing on both CD and DVD as Seven Moons Live. This was later released as a joint CD/DVD package, retitled as, Song From The Road.  Level 42  Following the departure of original band members Phil Gould and Boon Gould in 1987, Husband was invited to join (as drummer) a new edition of the British chart-topping pop/funk band Level 42 and did so early in 1988 while still holding down work touring work with Allan Holdsworth (who also toured with Level 42 having recorded the 'Guaranteed' album with them). He recorded two studio albums with the group during his tenure (Staring at the Sun and Guaranteed) and left the band in March 1992. In 2000, he rejoined Level 42 frontman and bassist Mark King briefly in his group and then on a session basis went on to perform again on tours as part of a reformed Level 42 lineup before finally leaving a few years later following the release of the band's Retroglide album of 2006. Husband has enjoyed a longtime friendship with Mark King and has supported him on his solo projects, notably 'Mark King and Friends' where Husband played keyboards.  Other affiliations   Jazz  Husband has played with a multitude of jazz artists throughout his career. During his teenage years he played with saxophonist Alan Wakeman, trombonist Malcolm Griffiths and late avant-garde jazz composer Pat Evans. In 1980 he toured and recorded a radio broadcast with a quartet led by pianist Gordon Beck and Allan Holdsworth along with bassist Jeff Clyne. In the 1990s (playing drums) he was a member of saxophonist Alan Skidmore's Quartet, guitarist Jim Mullen's Quartet and a number of others. Gary also played engagements with pianist Geoffrey Keezer and bassist James Genus (in support of Keezer's Turn Up The Quiet album) and toured Canada in 1998 with the pianist along with bassist Christian McBride. In the 2000s he recorded the album Introducing with saxophonist Renato D'Aiello as pianist. On drums, he was also a member of the Julian Siegel Quartet, played live with pianist Olga Konkova's trio (along with bassist Per Mathisen) and the Randy Brecker/Bob Berg group with pianist Kevin Hays. In 2006 he joined forces with saxophonist Christof Lauer for a trio project with tuba player Michel Godard and recorded the album Blues In Mind. Husband was drummer and pianist in the project and the band's repertoire was made up of original compositions from all three musicians. More recently has worked with pianist Yaron Herman's trio, drummer Peter Erskine, drummer/composer Asaf Sirkis (contributing a composition to his trio's The Monk album, and performing as guest keyboardist.) In February 2015 Husband recorded \\"The Goldilocks Zone\\" album (playing drums) in Spain with Olga Konkova Trio along with bassist Per Mathisen In April 2017 Gary began playing live with pianist Antonio Fara√≤ in trio formation, along with performing guests Bir√©li Lagr√®ne and Didier Lockwood. In May 2017 Husband performed live with German pianist Joachim K√ºhn's trio featuring bassist Chris Jennings featuring guest performer Italian trumpeter Enrico Rava  Jazz fusion  Husband deputised for drummer Simon Phillips in the group RMS along with Mo Foster and Ray Russell in 1983, and has also performed and recorded with both musicians in more recent years on their own solo albums. In 1996 Gary performed on guitarist Anthony Hindson's album It's A Curious Life, which also featured Zakir Hussain, L. Shankar and Jack Bruce among others. In 1999 Husband recorded drums with trumpeter Iwan Van Hetten for his debut album Time. In 2006 Husband toured Europe with guitarist Mike Stern's group, and then again in 2009, in a version of the group that featured Randy Brecker and bassist Chris Minh Doky. He has also performed and recorded on projects with keyboardist/composer Aydin Esen, bassists Jonas Hellborg, Janek Gwizdala, drummers Sebastiaan Cornelisson, Jason Smith and the Jazz Fusion/Jam band Gongzilla with bassist Hansford Rowe (musician), percussionist Beno√Æt Moerlen and guitarist Bon Lozaga. Husband also performs with guitarist Apostolis Anthimos's trio and bassist Janek Gwizdala's group on occasions. In November 2013 Husband joined Lenny White & Friends as keyboardist for performances in London and Switzerland. The group also featured Foley (musician), Bennie Maupin and bassist Jerry Brooks. Husband guested on Dewa Budjana's 2014 album \\"Surya Namaskar\\" on synth and more recently recorded with the Indonesian guitarist on Budjana‚Äôs ‚ÄúZentuary‚Äù album as pianist, drummer and lead synths along with Jack DeJohnette, bassist Tony Levin and others. Husband performed on piano, electric piano and lead synthesiser on bassist/composer Oytun Ersan‚Äôs 2018 ‚ÄúFusiolicious‚Äù album along with Dave Weckl, Eric Marienthal, Brett Garsed, Mike Miller and others.  Rock and progressive rock  In 1986 Husband briefly became a member of Esquire with vocalist Nikki Squire, bassist Nigel McLaren, guitarist Steve Topping, and keyboardist Charles Olins. In 1996 Husband toured Europe with guitarist Andy Summers to support Summers' Synaesthesia album. He has also appeared with guitarist Jeff Beck. The long friendship and musical relationship Husband has had with the guitarist Steve Topping resulted in a CD of early jams from the 1980s (entitled What It Is) also featuring bassist Paul Carmichael. Husband performed drums and keyboards on Topping's 1997 debut album Time & Distance and his 2004 album Late Flower. In May 2012 he joined UK with Eddie Jobson, John Wetton, and Alex Machacek on their Night after Night 2012 tour, replacing Terry Bozzio on drums for their European concerts. He headlined with the group at the NEARfest Apocalypse 2012 festival in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He joined guitarist Marcelo Paganini for his album 2012 Space Traffic Jam in 2013 with Eumir Deodato on keyboards, Tony Kaye on keyboards, and bassist Billy Sherwood. In March 2015 Husband stepped in for drummer John Stanley Marshall, performing with Soft Machine Legacy for a short tour of Japan with John Etheridge, Theo Travis, Roy Babbington, and guest artist Keith Tippett. In May 2017 he recorded in Spain for guitarist Dusan Jevtovic on his album with Markus Reuter and bassist Bernat Hern√°ndez for Moonjune Records.  Big bands / composers and arrangers  Gary had the opportunity to perform with Gil Evans in the early 1980s, in both a live and recording session setting. Since 2005, Husband has been a regular guest drummer with Hamburg's Norddeutscher Rundfunk Big Band, and through this association he has worked for composers and arrangers such as Colin Towns, Maria Schneider, J√∂rg Achim Keller, Steve Gray, Dieter Glawischnig, Geir Lysne, Florian Ross, Michael Gibbs, Mischa Schumann, Marko Lackner and behind featured performers such as Joe Lovano, Al Jarreau, Norma Winstone, Maria Pia de Vito and Nguyen Le. He has also performed in projects with the HR Big Band of Frankfurt (with which he has also appeared as a featured special guest artist at the Rome Jazz Festival), with composer Helge Sunde and the Norrbotten Big Band of Sweden and for a Jack Bruce project with the UK's BBC Big Band. In August 2012, Gary Husband performed at the Solidarity of Arts Festival in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland with Quincy Jones, Tomasz Sta≈Ñko and the NDR Bigband. In May 2013 Husband performed and recorded Nguyen Le's \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon - Tribute to Pink Floyd\\" project with leader Michael Gibbs, Maria Pia de Vito and the NDR Bigband.  Pop  In 1989 Husband performed (along with members of the group Level 42 and musical director Sir George Martin) as \\"house band\\" drummer for The Prince's Trust Rock Gala, backing artists such as Mike + The Mechanics, Andy Bell (singer), Will Downing, Alexander O'Neal, John Farnham, Swing Out Sister, Mica Paris and Spandau Ballet. Husband toured often with the guitarist Gary Moore through various band lineups from 1993 into the early 2000s, and performed on three of Moore's studio albums. He also recorded with singers such as Jimmy Nail and Brian Houston (musician), toured with singer Ron Sexsmith and recorded for drum n' bass protagonists Dillinja and Lemon D in this period.  Acknowledgements  Gary Husband's proficiency on both drums and keyboards has received praise from other musicians and critics. In 2017, Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree referred to him as \\"a great, amazingly talented musician! ... He's off the charts talented, this guy. I don't know anyone else in the world who can play piano at that level, and drums at that level\\". Billy Cobham has called his keyboard skill \\"one of the best-kept secrets in music\\". Music critic John Fordham of The Guardian considers him one of the best British musicians in the contemporary post-bop scene, describing Husband's pianistic style as \\"an onrush of long-lined phrases and ambiguous harmonies boldly adapted from Herbie Hancock and Bill Evans.\\" In 2011, when asked to recommend modern drummers to a drumming magazine, Bill Bruford of King Crimson mentioned Gary Husband, stating that \\"anything Gary plays on is great\\" and concluding that he is among the \\"players [who] are helping push the boundaries of how things should be.\\" Pat Mastelotto said that Husband is an \\"inspiration to every drummer.\\" Other drummers who have cited him as an influence or expressed admiration for his drumming work are Dennis Chambers, Tomas Haake of Meshuggah. Sean Reinert of Cynic, Peter Wildoer of Darkane, and Rick Colaluca of Watchtower.

In recognition of his work and in other areas, Mezei was awarded the first Walter Haelg Prize in 1999. Neutron spin echo animation showing the response of a beam of neutrons (red arrows) in their blue Bloch sphere as they travel through a series of magnets In magnetic resonance, a spin echo is the refocusing of spin magnetisation by a pulse of resonant electromagnetic radiation. The spin echo spectrometer possesses an extremely high energy resolution (roughly one part in 100,000). Additionally, it measures the density-density correlation (or intermediate scattering function) F(Q,t) as a function of momentum transfer Q and time. Other neutron scattering techniques measure the dynamic structure factor S(Q,œâ), which can be converted to F(Q,t) by a Fourier transform, which may be difficult in practice. For weak inelastic features S(Q,œâ) is better suited, however, for (slow) relaxations the natural representation is given by F(Q,t). Because of its extraordinary high effective energy resolution compared to other neutron scattering techniques, NSE is an ideal method to observe overdamped internal dynamic modes (relaxations) and other diffusive processes in materials such as a polymer blends, alkane chains, or microemulsions. The extraordinary power of NSE spectrometry was further demonstrated recently by the direct observation of coupled internal protein dynamics in the proteins NHERF1 and Taq polymerase, allowing the direct visualization of protein nanomachinery in motion. Several elementary reviews of the technique exist. How it works Neutron spin echo is a time- of-flight technique. Concerning the neutron spins it has a strong analogy to the so-called Hahn echo, well known in the field of NMR. In both cases the loss of polarization (magnetization) due to dephasing of the spins in time is restored by an effective time reversal operation, that leads to a restitution of polarization (rephasing). In NMR the dephasing happens due to variation in the local fields at positions of the nuclei, in NSE the dephasing is due to different neutron velocities in the incoming neutron beam. The Larmor precession of the neutron spin in a preparation zone with a magnetic field before the sample encodes the individual velocities of neutrons in the beam into precession angles. Close to the sample the time reversal is effected by a so-called flipper. A symmetric decoding zone follows such that at its end the precession angle accumulated in the preparation zone is exactly compensated (provided the sample did not change the neutron velocity, i.e. elastic scattering), all spins rephase to form the \\"spin-echo\\". Ideally the full polarization is restored. This effect does not depend on the velocity/energy/wavelength of the incoming neutron. If the scattering at the sample is not elastic but changes the neutron velocity, the rephasing will become incomplete and a loss of final polarization results, which depends on the distribution of differences in the time, which the neutrons need to fly through the symmetric first (coding) and second (decoding)precession zones. The time differences occur due to a velocity change acquired by non-elastic scattering at the sample. The distribution of these time differences is proportional (in the linearization approximation which is appropriate for quasi-elastic high resolution spectroscopy) to the spectral part of the scattering function S(Q,œâ). The effect on the measured beam polarization is proportional to the cos-Fourier transform of the spectral function, the intermediate scattering function F(Q,t). The time parameter depends on the neutron wavelength and the factor connecting precession angle with (reciprocal) velocity, which can e.g. be controlled by setting a certain magnetic field in the preparation and decoding zones. Scans of t may then be performed by varying the magnetic field. It is important to note: that all the spin manipulations are just a means to detect velocity changes of the neutron, which influence‚Äîfor technical reasons‚Äîin terms of a Fourier transform of the spectral function in the measured intensity. The velocity changes of the neutrons convey the physical information which is available by using NSE, i.e. I(Q,t) \\\\propto S(Q) + \\\\int \\\\cos (\\\\omega t) \\\\, S(Q,\\\\omega)\\\\, dt where \\\\omega \\\\propto \\\\Delta v and t \\\\propto B \\\\times \\\\lambda^3 . B denotes the precession field strength, Œª the (average) neutron wavelength and Œîv the neutron velocity change upon scattering at the sample. The main reason for using NSE is that by the above means it can reach Fourier times of up to many 100ns, which corresponds to energy resolutions in the neV range. The closest approach to this resolution by a spectroscopic neutron instrument type, namely the backscattering spectrometer (BSS), is in the range of 0.5 to 1 ŒºeV. The spin- echo trick allows to use an intense beam of neutrons with a wavelength distribution of 10% or more and at the same time to be sensitive to velocity changes in the range of less than 10‚àí4. Note: the above explanations assumes the generic NSE configuration‚Äîas first utilized by the IN11 instrument at the Institut Laue‚ÄìLangevin (ILL)--. Other approaches are possible like the resonance spin echo, NRSE with concentrated a DC field and a RF field in the flippers at the end of preparation and decoding zones which then are without magnetic field (zero field). In principle these approaches are equivalent concerning the connection of the final intensity signal with the intermediate scattering function. Due to technical difficulties until now they have not reached the same level of performance than the generic (IN11) NSE types. What it can measure In soft matter research the structure of macromolecular objects is often investigated by small angle neutron scattering, SANS. The exchange of hydrogen with deuterium in some of the molecules creates scattering contrast between even equal chemical species. The SANS diffraction pattern‚Äîif interpreted in real space‚Äîcorresponds to a snapshot picture of the molecular arrangement. Neutron spin echo instruments can analyze the inelastic broadening of the SANS intensity and thereby analyze the motion of the macromolecular objects. A coarse analogy would be a photo with a certain opening time instead of the SANS like snapshot(So we can analyze the vibration frequency of the molecules as well as arrangement). The opening time corresponds to the Fourier time which depends on the setting of the NSE spectrometer, it is proportional to the magnetic field (integral) and to the third power of the neutron wavelength. Values up to several hundreds of nanoseconds are available. Note that the spatial resolution of the scattering experiment is in the nanometer range, which means that a time range of e.g. 100 ns corresponds to effective molecular motion velocities of 1 nm/100 ns = 1 cm/s. This may be compared to the typical neutron velocity of 200..1000 m/s used in these type of experiments. NSE and spin-incoherent scattering (from protons) Many inelastic studies that use normal time-of-flight (TOF) or backscattering spectrometers rely on the huge incoherent neutron scattering cross section of protons. The scattering signal is dominated by the corresponding contribution, which represents the (average) self-correlation function (in time) of the protons. For NSE spin incoherent scattering has the disadvantage that it flips the neutron spins during scattering with a probability of 2/3. Thus converting 2/3 of the scattering intensity into \\"non- polarized\\" background and putting a factor of -1/3 in front of the cos-Fourier integral contribution pertaining the incoherent intensity. This signal subtracts from the coherent echo signal. The result may be a complicated combination which cannot be decomposed if only NSE is employed. However, in pure cases, i.e. when there is an overwhelming intensity contribution due to protons, NSE can be used to measure their incoherent spectrum. The intensity situation of NSE‚Äîfor e.g. soft-matter samples‚Äîis the same as in small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Molecular objects with coherent scattering contrast at low momentum transfer (Q) show coherent scattering at considerably higher intensity than the incoherent background scattering. This effect weakens as Q becomes larger. For systems containing hydrogen, contrast requires the presence of some protons as even pure deuterated samples show weak spin- incoherent scattering from deuterons. Fully protonated samples allow successful measurements but at intensities of the order of the SANS background level. Note: This interference with the spin manipulation of the NSE technique occurs only with spin-incoherent scattering. Isotopic incoherent scattering yields a \\"normal\\" NSE signal.
