Employers practice this technique for a number of reasons. It was designed to promote flexibility of employees and to keep employees interested into staying with the company/organization which employs them. There is also research that shows how job rotations help relieve the stress of employees who work in a job that requires manual labor. Objectives = What are the objectives? = This chart illustrates the Objectives for Job Rotation #Employee Learning ##Rotation making employees more versatile ##Gives employees a broader understanding of the business allowing them to be better prepared to be promoted to management. #Employer Learning ##Using job rotation employers can learn their individual worker's strengths ##Employers receive a flexible and knowledgeable workforce that can be sourced throughout the company or agency. #Employee Motivation ##Rotation reduces boredomEriksson, Tor, and Jaime Ortega. \\"The Adoption of Job Rotation: Testing the Theories\\".

Web... ##More knowledge of the company as a whole may lead to more promotions. = Who Benefits? = Along with the company providing the opportunities and training for job rotation, the employees who participate in job rotation learn more than the one job specification deemed to them, benefiting them in the long run in case of an open position on moving up in the company or a position opening up in another firm. Along with employees benefiting, companies benefit as well. The business can hire fewer people since the majority of their staff will be able to be versatile in the job functions that the company may demand, saving the company more money and possibly giving the current employees a better salary.Arya, Anil, and Brian Mittendorf. \\"Using Optional Job Rotation Programs to Gauge On-the-job Learning\\". Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Staatswissenschaft 162.3 (2006): 505‚Äì515. https://www.jstor.org Job rotation is beneficial to the company in terms of productivity and reducing the leave of absence workers take throughout the year. A study was conducted to see what motivates employees in their job performance. Job security was among the least motivators. Employees wanted a sense of responsibility and pride in their tasks performed. Job rotation was created for small crews to see if the company could produce a greater employee satisfaction, desire to become comfortable in their job functions, and decrease the desire to avoid their overtime duty.McGuire, John H.. ‚ÄúProductivity Gains Through Job Reorganization and Rotation‚Äù. Journal (American Water Works Association) 73.12 (1981): 622‚Äì623. Web... Goals = Why is job rotation beneficial? = Some employees are paid more for they are presenting that they are worth a greater amount since they can perform more than one job function and thus makes a higher incentive for more employees to be able to perform better in the workplace. It is a common perception to see that employees who normally opt into the program of job rotation that these individuals tend to have \\"higher perceived skills\\" and are more likely to be promoted. Sometimes job rotation is practiced for the individual worker's health benefit. This practice helps rotates the individual tasks and muscle movements. It reduces the stress of an average workday so that the workers do not feel the tension in their muscles as well as can keep up in their demanding workplace. There has been electromyographic studies on this technique from mining to assembly lines.Bengt Johnson, ‚ÄúElectromyographic Studies of Job Rotation,‚Äù Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health Vol 14 (May 1988):108-109.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40958847 Job rotation also gives a firm a back-up plan in the case a work-gap is created in the firm.  Job rotation in action  = Semco Partners = Semco is a Brazilian firm known for implementing job rotation in order to discourage key people from keeping trade secrets which might get lost should they leave, and because it forces the company to develop more than one expert in any particular field. = Toyo Kogyo Company = Toyo Kogyo Company is the Japanese firm that now produces Mazda automobiles. Toyo Kogyo has been practicing job rotation for over 20 years as a direct result of the oil embargo of the 1960s. Toyo looked to job rotation to fill gaps in experience due to the cutbacks needed during a downturn in the economy. This has resulted in company with a very efficient workforce that is more knowledgeable than their more specialized competitors. = Intel Corporation = Intel Corporation now uses job rotation as a means to fill temporary positions from within their own organization. In 11 months Intel filled about 1300 jobs lasting from weeks to years. These positions were available in various fields such as HR, Marketing, Finance and Product development. These assignments are meant to rein in restless workers as well as giving opportunities to employees to learn new technologies and strategies that they may not have been familiar with before. Many employees who experience this form of job rotation are given looks into fields that may be foreign letting them have a greater understanding of the company as a whole. = Virgin America = Virgin America has experimented with a one-year employee exchange program with Virgin Australia. The two companies traded flight attendants between each other to create excitement and energy among its employees. While trades are not as beneficial as job rotation among skill employees the short term benefits may help customer service and the general mood of the employees working for the airline. =Unilever= Unilever now enables job rotation for its employees for the purpose of personal growth. With the help of an internal talent mobilization tool, the company empowers employees with the visibility to relevant career opportunities within the organization and reduces voluntary turnover. In parallel, managers enjoy a better access to internal talent, which enables them to quickly fill in professional vacancies in a fraction of the usual hiring costs.  Workers  = Benefits = Job rotation may also be used to alleviate the physical and mental stresses endured by employees when working at the same position, year after year. By allowing employees to rotate to other positions, the risk factors for some types of musculoskeletal disorders may be reduced. Job Rotation is also believed to have the ability to decrease the amount of boredom and monotony experienced by employees who work the same position for extended periods of time. Job rotation caters to the employee's preferences in a variety of tasks, letting them be more flexible in their positions while endowing workers with a wide range of skills. This also allows the worker job security by developing multiple skills instead of specializing in one aspect. In times of urgency or emergency employees in job rotation are prepared to deal with unusual operations other more specialized workers may not be able to.Co≈ügel, Metin M., and Thomas J. Miceli. 1999. \\"Job Rotation: Cost, Benefits, and Stylized Facts\\". Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift F√ºr Die Gesamte Staatswissenschaft 155 (2). Mohr Siebeck GmbH & Co. KG: 301‚Äì20. https://www.jstor.org/stable/40752141. = Drawbacks = There are some negative attributes associated with job rotation. Firstly, some positions within a company may not be eligible for rotation. There may be positions within a company that may be specialized due to technology or may require highly skilled workers.Hsieh, A. These positions may not fit the profile for rotation opportunities because of the costs involved to train the workers. Another problem faced by companies is that some employ unionized workers that may be resistant to job rotation due to standard union practices.Jaturanonda,C.  Private sector  = Benefits = Employers are able to evaluate employees not only for their output but also for their personality traits and team work skills. \\"Output measures may easily be translated into attributes such as leadership abilities, technical competence, relations with others and judgement.\\"Hatvany, Nina, and Vladimir Pucik. 1981. \\"An Integrated Management System: Lessons from the Japanese Experience\\". The Academy of Management Review 6 (3). Academy of Management: 469‚Äì80. https://www.jstor.org/stable/257382. Job rotation benefits the private sector by allowing workers to become flexible in skills needed throughout the company not just in one section or division, this allows companies to benefit through lower costs of needing to train new employees to do the same job. There are different reasons a company may choose to use job rotation such as using job rotation as a learning mechanism. Research suggests that there are significant benefits that may out weigh the costs involved with training employees for diversified positions. This employment opportunity has an effect of boosting morale and self efficacy.Schultz, D. The company may benefit from using job rotation by having the ability to staff key positions within a company that are needed at the moment instead of having to train a specialist to fill an urgent position. This practice may allow a company to run more efficiently, and as a result, become more productive and profitable. = Drawbacks =  Cost of job rotation  The cost of job rotation can be directly linked to the productive gains made through specialization.

The utilization of job rotation may have the effect of reducing a workforce due to the cross-training involved; a company may not be required to hire additional staff to cover positions and may cause a layoff of current employees no longer considered necessary.  Public sector  = Benefits = Job rotation in the public sector can be used to create communication networks between agencies. This is a benefit for agencies this in times of interagency involvement, or times of emergency.Successful Interagency Rotation Programs‚ÄîA Win-Win for Participating Individuals and Organizations > \\"Interagency assignments can promote networks among personnel from the host > and home agencies.

Brookings Institution Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7864/j.ctt7zsvkw.14. = Drawbacks = Drawbacks from Job Rotation in the public sector are often affected the most by lack of cooperation between the agencies involved. Each agency must come into the project fully or the project is likely to fail; making these projects often hard to create or manage. Uneven exchanged in workforce talent can occur when one agency sends skilled personnel to another agency only to receive lower skilled personnel in return. This not only affects the consistency of work coming out of the first agency, but also has the effect of making managers more apprehensible to the aspect of future programs. Employees in these situations oftentimes feel that their careers are put on hold the moment they participate in rotation. Employees feel their contributions at other agencies will not be valued as much by their home agency. Employees feel they will be looked over and miss future opportunities due to lack of recognition and difference in location. > \\"These programs are not easy to design and manage effectively, and can > impose significant costs on the individuals and organizations involved. > Cultural differences that exist among different agencies, funding streams, > and authorities that flow toward a single agency rather than toward > enterprise-level goals are additional factors that complicate agencies‚Äô > abilities to work together to design a win-win program.\\" References *Black, S.

Chomutov has been a statutory city since 1 July 2006. It occupies an area of 29.26 km¬≤ and has almost 50,000 inhabitants. There are almost 80,000 inhabitants in the city's wider metropolitan area. Geography The city is located on the river Chomutovka, at the foot of the Ore Mountains. The surface is mostly flat with some hills in the north and southeast of the city. Administrative division Chomutov is a municipality with extended competence (), meaning the city holds certain administrative powers delegated from the state government. Of the 24 other municipalities that make up the metropolitan area, one (Jirkov) has an authorized municipality office, meaning it is delegated some parts of the authority of a municipality with extended competence. The administrative territory of Chomutov borders with Germany in the north. Additionally, it borders with the territories of Kada≈à in the west, Louny in the south, Most in the east and Litv√≠nov in the northeast. History In 1252 Chomutov came into the possession of the Teutonic Order. The Gothic church of St. Catharine built during that era still stands to this day. In 1396 Chomutov received a town charter, and in 1416 the knights sold both the town and the lordship to Wenceslaus IV. On March 16, 1421, the town was stormed, sacked and burned by the Taborites. After several upheavals and changes of ownership, Chomutov was taken by Popel of Lobkovic in 1588, who established Jesuit rule, leading to trouble between the Protestant citizens and the town's new overlord. In 1594 the feudal lordship fell to the crown, and in 1605 the town purchased its freedom and was made a royal city. After the Thirty Years' War, Chomutov stagnated. Rapid development did not come until the second half of the 19th century, with advances in the mining and heavy industries. By 1938 Chomutov had over 30,000 inhabitants. Part of the Sudetenland, it had a population comprising about 95% ethnic Germans. A very small Jewish population, (444 in 1930 ‚Äì 1.3% of the total population), came under increasing pressure, and Chomutov was declared \\"Judenrein\\" on September 23, 1938 by the increasingly pro-Nazi administration. A week later, Chomutov and its surrounding districts were occupied by Nazi Germany as a result of the 1938 Munich Agreement. This broader, north-western border area of what is the modern-day Czech Republic was annexed by Germany and reorganized as the Reichsgau Sudetenland. After 1945, the previous population, German by a large majority, was expelled.App, Dr. Austin J., PhD, The Sudeten-German Tragedy, Maryland, 1979.de Zayas, Alfred Maurice, A Terrible Revenge, New York, 2nd edition, 1994. Industrial facilities and large high-rise housing projects were then built to redevelop the area. In the late 1970s an urban settlement was built, linking Chomutov with its neighbouring Jirkov. Following the Velvet Revolution of 1989, the heavy industry significantly decreased its activity, but the environment in and around the town has been visibly improved. The leisure facilities of the area were emphasised, notably the Alum lake, the Chomutov Zoo, and the Bezruƒç Valley recreational area. Development of population Historical sights Pillar of Trinity The centre of the historical city is in the shape of an oblong, and is surrounded by arcades. The Square of 1 May with its baroque Pillar of Trinity by Ambro≈æ Laurentis from 1697 is banked by seven statues of saints built between 1725 and 1732. The Town Hall is situated in the northwest side and it used to be a commendam until 1607. The Town Hall is situated next to the church of St. Catherine built in early Gothic style and finished in 1281. On the opposite side there is the church of Assumption Virgin Mary, built in late Gothic style between 1518 and 1542, which is situated next to the 53 m tall City Tower which was renovated after the fire in 1525 and which is used as an observation tower. Church of Saint Ignatius At the end of the south side there is the Baroque church of St. Ignatz with two towers on the north frontage. The church was built for Jesuits by Carlo Lurago between 1663 and 1671. The building called ≈†pejchar from the 17th century was used by Jesuits as earlier church and it adjoins the east side of the church of St. Ignatz. Nowadays it is used as a gallery. There is a Jesuitical dormitory south of the church of St. Ignatz from the 16th and 17th century which is nowadays a settlement of the city museum. The most important building from the Gothic residential houses is the late Gothic house no. 9, which is at the bottom of the northeast side of the square. Alum Lake, at an altitude of 337 m, is located on the northeast edge of Chomutov. It was caused at the end of the 18th century by flooding the mines used between the 16th and 18th centuries. It occupies an area of 16.3 ha, the maximum depth is 3.25 m and its volume is 285,000 m¬≥. The high content (about 1%) of alum in the water from Alum Lake prevents the lake from the growth of weed and anabaena. For that reason it is very frequently visited in the summer months. The Ore Mountains Zoo borders with the Alum Lake on its north side. It is a zoo concentrated mostly on breeding European and mainly domestic wild animals (wolf, european bison, etc.). Bezruƒç Valley is a 13 km long and 200 m deep woody valley on the river Chomutovka in the northwestern side of the city and it is a popular place for trips. Str√°≈æi≈°tƒõ Hill (551 m) rises over the northern edge of Chomutov and on its peak there is a hotel with an observation tower.

Oneida is one of the world‚Äôs largest designers and sellers of stainless steel and silverplated cutlery and tableware for the consumer and foodservice industries. It is also the largest supplier of dinnerware to the foodservice industry in North America.\\"Monomoy Capital Partners Acquires Oneida Ltd\\". The company operates in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Asia, marketing and distributing tabletop products, which include flatware, dinnerware, crystal stemware, glassware and kitchen tools and gadgets. The company originated in the late-nineteenth century in Oneida, New York.c.f. Oneida Circular, Oneida: Oneida Community, 1873. p. 193. History =Origins= The company arose out of the utopian Oneida Community, which was established in Oneida, New York, in 1848.C. N. Robertson, Oneida Community: An autobiography, 1851-1876. Syracuse: University Press, 1970. pp. 14-23. The Oneida Association (later Oneida Community) was founded by a small group of Christian Perfectionists led by John Humphrey Noyes, Jonathan Burt, George W. Cragin, Harriet A.Noyes, George W. Noyes, John L. Skinner and a few others.C. N. Robertson,Oneida Community, an autobiography. pp. 10-15. In 1880, after more than 30 years operating as a commune, the Oneida Community voted to transfer much of the common property to a joint-stock company to be known as Oneida Community Ltd. effective January 1, 1881.C.N. Robertson, Oneida Community, the breakup, 1876-1881. Syracuse: University Press, 1972. pp. 301-311. Oneida Community Ltd. was one of the earliest joint-stock companies in the United States. Its founders' religious philosophy helped inform the early development of the company, in which members of the former Oneida Community became shareholders in the company. Its progressive nature also allowed for a woman, Harriet Joselyn, to sit on the board of directors ‚Äî a departure from the norm for the time. Oneida Community started production of silver-plated flatware and hollow-ware in 1899 using the \\"Community Plate\\" mark. Oneida Community purchased the Wm A. Rogers and 1881 Rogers companies in 1929 and started producing a somewhat lower-quality line of products using those companies‚Äô marks. In 1935, Oneida Community changed its name to Oneida Ltd. =Post-war growth= Oneida Limited successfully adapted to the difficult economic conditions of the First World War and Second World War. Throughout both of these world economic upheavals, Oneida adapted its manufacturing capabilities. During the First World War, it produced ammunition clips, lead-plated gas shells, combat knives, and surgical instruments; during World War II, the company added army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and even jet engine parts to its manufacturing repertoire. Oneida made many goods for the war. The company then managed an innovative transition to the manufacture of stainless steel flatware in 1961, which eventually dwarfed its production of silver-plated flatware.A History of Oneida Silverware, China & Crystal In 1971, Oneida purchased the Camden Wire Co., Inc., a major manufacturer of industrial wire products. By the 1980s, Oneida made at least half of all flatware purchased in the United States. In 1983, the company acquired Rena- Ware, a Bellevue-based kitchenware manufacturer with a majority international operations. Oneida sold Rena-ware three years later. In 1984, it acquired D.J. Tableware, a flatware and china manufacturer that targeted the foodservice industry. =Modern era= At the end of the 1990s, the company encountered tough economic times, however it still tried to hold on to its mantle as the last remaining US-based manufacturer of flatware, knives, forks, and spoons. The events surrounding 9/11 negatively affected the hospitality and consumer tableware markets, and in November 2003, Oneida sold its 100-year-old Buffalo China plant and four overseas factories in Mexico, China, and Italy. \\"Oneida Ltd. To Close Five Plants\\" In February 2004, it sold off more assets to BC Acquisition Co. LLC for $5.5 million.\\"Oneida Ltd. Finds Buyer For Buffalo China's Assets\\" Eventually, the manufacturing facilities in Sherrill, New York were sold to Sherrill Manufacturing on March 22, 2005.\\"Sherrill Manufacturing resumes flatware production with boost from Internet retailer\\" In 1996, Oneida Limited acquired THC Systems, Inc., including its team of professionals, which operated under the name Rego China.\\"Oneida Ltd. Acquires China Importing Firm\\" Oneida Limited transitioned from its manufacturing history and focused on design and marketing of its products that are globally sourced. Sales, marketing, advertising, procurement, customer service, legal and operational support is also still based in Oneida, New York. The company was taken private in 2006. Oneida no longer operates manufacturing in the United States. Partly as a consequence of the economic blowback from 9/11, Oneida Limited's sales fell more than $157 million.New York Times: \\"Oneida's Backer Sees a Future in Flatware\\" In 2006, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. After stabilizing financially and reducing its debt load, the company was purchased by a group of hedge funds led by Monarch Alternative Capital. Oneida announced at the beginning of 2009 they were transitioning away from company-owned outlet stores due to poor financial results but retaining the original outlet store in Sherrill, New York.\\"Oneida Ltd. closing outlet stores\\"Company Store In September 2010, Oneida launched a new website, Oneida.com. In November 2011, Oneida Limited was acquired by Monomoy Capital Partners, a mid-sized New York City equity fund.\\"Oneida Ltd. president sees bright future under new buyer\\"Monomoy Capital Partners website In 2012 Monomoy merged Oneida with Anchor Hocking and created EveryWare Global. In January 2014, EveryWare Global announced its plans to close its regional office and the Oneida outlet store, both in Sherrill, NY, with the process starting in April. The original Oneida outlet store in Sherrill, New York, was closed April 26, 2014.http://www.oneidadispatch.com/article/OD/20140307/NEWS/140309371 EveryWare Global filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Monomoy-backed EveryWare Global to file for bankruptcy EveryWare Global was renamed The Oneida Group in 2017.EveryWare Global Changes Corporate Name to The Oneida Group Operations =Manufacturing= Oneida has had a variety of manufacturing facilities and capabilities throughout its existence. In addition to tableware, the company started out by manufacturing silk, traps, and chains. It gradually ceased these enterprises as they became less profitable for the company. In 1916, Oneida opened its first international factory in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Oneida was a major WW2 manufacturer. During World War II, Oneida purchased a factory in Canastota, New York, to manufacture army trucks, aircraft survival kits, and jet engine parts. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Oneida's workforce grew from 2,000 to 3,000 workers, and it transitioned into manufacturing stainless steel flatware.

Founded in Roman times, it has a population of 55,000, and is known as a tourist destination on the Italian Riviera. It hosts numerous cultural events, such as the Sanremo Music Festival and the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo cycling classic. Name The name of the city is a phonetic contraction of Sant'Eremo di San Romolo, which refers to Romulus of Genoa, the successor to Syrus of Genoa. It is often stated in modern folk stories that Sanremo is a translation of \\"Saint Remus\\", a deceased Saint. In Ligurian, his name is San R≈ìmu. The spelling San Remo is on all ancient maps of Liguria, the ancient Republic of Genoa, Italy in the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Kingdom of Italy. It was used in 1924 in official documents under Mussolini. This form of the name appears still on some road signs and, more rarely, in unofficial tourist information. It has been the most widely used form of the name in English at least since the 19th century. History Sanremo postcard from the 1920s Once the Roman settlement of Matutia or Villa Matutiana, Sanremo expanded in the Early Middle Ages when the population moved to the high grounds. The nobility built a castle and the walled village of La Pigna to protect the town from Saracen raids. At first subjected to the countship of Ventimiglia, the community later passed under the dominion of the Genoese bishops. In 1297 they sold it to the Doria and De Mari families. It became a free town in the second half of the 15th century, after which it expanded to the Pigna hill and at Saint Syrus Cathedral. The almost perfectly preserved old village remains. Sanremo remained independent of Genoese Republic. In 1753, after 20 years of fierce conflicts, it rose against Genoese hegemonical attempts. At that time Genoa built the fortress of Santa Tecla, situated on the beach near the port. The fortress was used as a prison until 2002. It is now being transformed into a museum. After the French domination and the Savoy restoration in 1814, Sanremo was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. From the middle of the 18th century the town grew rapidly, in part due to the development of tourism, which saw the first grand hotels built and the town extended along the coast. The Empress \\"Sissi\\" of Austria, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia vacationed in Sanremo, while Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel made it his permanent home. The San Remo conference, 19‚Äì26 April 1920, of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council determined the allocation of Class \\"A\\" League of Nations mandates for administration of the former Ottoman-ruled lands of the Middle East by the victorious powers. The most notable of these was the British Mandate of Palestine. Economy Sanremo Municipal Casino Sanremo's Mediterranean climate and attractive seacoast setting on the Italian Riviera make it a popular tourist destination. Besides tourism, the city is active in the production of extra virgin-grade olive oil, whose regional \\"designation of origin\\" is protected (D.O.P., Denominazione di Origine Protetta). It is one of the agricultural commodities in western Liguria and in particular within the province of Imperia. Sanremo is known as the City of Flowers (la Citt√† dei Fiori), this being another important aspect of the economy of the city. The nearby towns of Arma di Taggia, Bordighera and Ospedaletti are also involved in the cultivation of flowers for the international flower market of Sanremo. The Municipal Casino, built in 1905, is an example of Art Nouveau building. The Ariston Theatre offers annual series of concerts, operas and theatre plays. The Symphony Orchestra is one of twelve symphony orchestras recognized by the state of Italy; it performs some 120 concerts throughout the year, most in the Municipal Casino's Opera Theatre. Transportation Sanremo cable car advertising, 1937 The city is connected to Genoa and to Ventimiglia, the border city with France, by the A10 motorway, whose last part is also known as the Autostrada dei Fiori (\\"Motorway of Flowers\\"). It has a large number of elevated sections with viaducts that give a panoramic view of the coast. The A10 joins the French A8 highway at the border between Ventimiglia and Menton. Together these national routes are part of the European route E80. The A10 motorway is a toll road, and the A8 demands a toll in sections, and some sections are free of charge. When travelling from Italy into France, one does not pay until after the towns of Menton and Monaco. Other roads of importance are the SS1, the \\"Aurelia Bis\\", which connects Sanremo to Taggia. This is a non-toll bypass route. The coast road is the via Aurelia or SS1 and follows the route of a Roman road. This can be heavily congested when it passes through towns, as it has only one lane in either direction for most of way around Sanremo. A trolleybus line along the via Aurelia links Sanremo with both Taggia and Ventimiglia. The closest airport to Sanremo is in France, the C√¥te d'Azur International Airport in Nice, 45 minutes away by car. The railway connects the city to the other Ligurian cities like Imperia, Genoa and to Nice, Milan, Turin and Rome. The railway line used to be along the coast, running close to the sea, and providing a view for travellers. The line has been moved further north and underground, which allows for faster trains; Sanremo railway station was relocated next to the City Hall. The city has refurbished the old railway line and converted it into a biking route and pedestrian area. There are several bike hire kiosks along the route and a choice of beaches to visit in either direction from San Remo. The path stretches between San Lorenzo al Mare in the west and Ospedaletti in the east.https://italy-cycling-guide.info/traffic-free-cycleways/cycling-riviera/  Geography  = Climate = Sanremo experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csa). Culture =Music festival= The Ariston Theatre hosts the celebrated annual Sanremo Music Festival, a very popular song contest held in the city since 1951. This festival inspired the Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, and for years the Sanremo festival selected the Italian entry. The internationally notable song Nel blu dipinto di blu, also known as Volare, was performed at this festival for the first time by Domenico Modugno in 1958. The festival is so popular among Italians that it is often referred to simply as \\"Il Festival\\" (The Festival). Other events include the Tenco Prize (autumn), a song contest for authors dedicated to the memory of Luigi Tenco; the Flowers Parade in January/February in which every city of the Italian Riviera presents an original composition of flowers displayed on a Carnival/Mardi-Gras style moving car; and the summer Firework International Contest in the second week of August also called Ferragosto. =Cuisine= The culinary specialities of Sanremo and environs include Sardenara, Focaccia, Focaccia alle Cipolle, Torta Verde, Farinata and Taggiasca olives. =Gambling= The Sanremo Casino (Casino Municipale di Sanremo) opened in 1905 and has operated continuously since then with the exception of the years of World War II. For much of its history, the casino was tolerated or granted exceptions to Italian gambling laws in order to allow the resort to compete with the casino towns in nearby France and Monaco. Sanremo hosts an annual poker tournament as part of the European Poker Tour. The city is widely accepted as the origin of the five-card stud variant telesina.

The Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition that was part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 1973 to 2003, when it was replaced by Rally d'Italia Sardegna on the island of Sardinia, in hosting the Italian round of the WRC. It is now part of European Rally Championship. Formerly a mixed surface event (tarmac and gravel), the rally has later been an all-tarmac event and takes place around the mountains. Sanremo is the finish of the classic Milan‚ÄìSan Remo cycle race. It is considered to be a \\"monument\\" - one of the five most important one-day races of the cycling season. Milan - San Remo is traditionally held in March and is one of the first major fixtures on the cycling season. At long, it is the longest professional one-day race in cycling, giving the race a unique character. The famous local football club is the A.S.D.

The result of this application of a weight function is a weighted sum or weighted average. Weight functions occur frequently in statistics and analysis, and are closely related to the concept of a measure. Weight functions can be employed in both discrete and continuous settings. They can be used to construct systems of calculus called \\"weighted calculus\\"Jane Grossman, Michael Grossman, Robert Katz. The First Systems of Weighted Differential and Integral Calculus, , 1980. and \\"meta- calculus\\".Jane Grossman.Meta-Calculus: Differential and Integral, , 1981.  Discrete weights  = General definition = In the discrete setting, a weight function \\\\scriptstyle w\\\\colon A \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R}^+ is a positive function defined on a discrete set A, which is typically finite or countable. The weight function w(a) := 1 corresponds to the unweighted situation in which all elements have equal weight. One can then apply this weight to various concepts. If the function \\\\scriptstyle f\\\\colon A \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R} is a real- valued function, then the unweighted sum of f on A is defined as :\\\\sum_{a \\\\in A} f(a); but given a weight function \\\\scriptstyle w\\\\colon A \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R}^+, the weighted sum or conical combination is defined as :\\\\sum_{a \\\\in A} f(a) w(a). One common application of weighted sums arises in numerical integration. If B is a finite subset of A, one can replace the unweighted cardinality B of B by the weighted cardinality :\\\\sum_{a \\\\in B} w(a). If A is a finite non- empty set, one can replace the unweighted mean or average :\\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{a \\\\in A} f(a) by the weighted mean or weighted average : \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{a \\\\in A} f(a) w(a)}{\\\\sum_{a \\\\in A} w(a)}. In this case only the relative weights are relevant. = Statistics = Weighted means are commonly used in statistics to compensate for the presence of bias. For a quantity f measured multiple independent times f_i with variance \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sigma^2_i, the best estimate of the signal is obtained by averaging all the measurements with weight \\\\scriptstyle w_i=\\\\frac 1 {\\\\sigma_i^2}, and the resulting variance is smaller than each of the independent measurements \\\\scriptstyle\\\\sigma^2=1/\\\\sum w_i. The maximum likelihood method weights the difference between fit and data using the same weights w_i. The expected value of a random variable is the weighted average of the possible values it might take on, with the weights being the respective probabilities. More generally, the expected value of a function of a random variable is the probability-weighted average of the values the function takes on for each possible value of the random variable. In regressions in which the dependent variable is assumed to be affected by both current and lagged (past) values of the independent variable, a distributed lag function is estimated, this function being a weighted average of the current and various lagged independent variable values. Similarly, a moving average model specifies an evolving variable as a weighted average of current and various lagged values of a random variable. = Mechanics = The terminology weight function arises from mechanics: if one has a collection of n objects on a lever, with weights \\\\scriptstyle w_1, \\\\ldots, w_n (where weight is now interpreted in the physical sense) and locations :\\\\scriptstyle\\\\boldsymbol{x}_1,\\\\dotsc,\\\\boldsymbol{x}_n, then the lever will be in balance if the fulcrum of the lever is at the center of mass :\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\\\boldsymbol{x}_i}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}, which is also the weighted average of the positions \\\\scriptstyle\\\\boldsymbol{x}_i.  Continuous weights  In the continuous setting, a weight is a positive measure such as w(x) \\\\, dx on some domain \\\\Omega,which is typically a subset of a Euclidean space \\\\scriptstyle{\\\\mathbb R}^n, for instance \\\\Omega could be an interval [a,b]. Here dx is Lebesgue measure and \\\\scriptstyle w\\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\R^+ is a non-negative measurable function. In this context, the weight function w(x) is sometimes referred to as a density. = General definition = If f\\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R} is a real-valued function, then the unweighted integral :\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)\\\\ dx can be generalized to the weighted integral :\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) w(x)\\\\, dx Note that one may need to require f to be absolutely integrable with respect to the weight w(x) \\\\, dx in order for this integral to be finite. = Weighted volume = If E is a subset of \\\\Omega, then the volume vol(E) of E can be generalized to the weighted volume : \\\\int_E w(x)\\\\ dx, = Weighted average = If \\\\Omega has finite non-zero weighted volume, then we can replace the unweighted average :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathrm{vol}(\\\\Omega)} \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)\\\\ dx by the weighted average : \\\\frac{\\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x)\\\\ w(x) dx}{\\\\int_\\\\Omega w(x)\\\\ dx} = Bilinear form = If f\\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R} and g\\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\to {\\\\mathbb R} are two functions, one can generalize the unweighted bilinear form :\\\\langle f, g \\\\rangle := \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) g(x)\\\\ dx to a weighted bilinear form :\\\\langle f, g \\\\rangle := \\\\int_\\\\Omega f(x) g(x)\\\\ w(x)\\\\ dx.

Cao Cao's decisive victory against Yuan Shao's numerically superior forces marked the turning point in their war. The victory was also the point at which Cao Cao became the dominant power in northern China, leading to the establishment of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period.  Background  The inevitability of military conflict between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had become apparent by 196. Yuan Shao held control of the lands north of the Yellow River, namely the Hebei region, while Cao Cao controlled most of the lands south of the Yellow River and kept Emperor Xian with him in the new capital city of Xu. The warlords saw each other as the obvious impediment to their individual ambitions to conquer and rule China. Some years before the battle, Yuan Shao's advisors Ju Shou and Tian Feng warned that Cao Cao would become a threat to their lord in his ambition to dominate China. They advised Yuan Shao to attack Cao Cao when the latter was still building up his forces, but Yuan Shao ignored their advice as Cao Cao was still nominally an ally. Tension between Cao Cao and Yuan Shao increased after Cao Cao moved Emperor Xian from the old capital Luoyang.  Prelude  The geographical position of Guandu (ÂÆòÊ∏°; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan) made it a stragetically vital position. It was near Yan Ford (Âª∂Ê¥•; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) on the Yellow River and lay on the road leading to the capital city Xu. Cao Cao recognized its strategic importance and in the autumn of 199, he stationed troops there and prepared fortifications. Other deployments along the frontline included Liu Yan () at Boma (ÁôΩÈ¶¨; near present-day Hua County, Henan), Yu Jin at Yan Ford, Cheng Yu at Juancheng (ÈÑÑÂüé; near present-day Juancheng County, Shandong), and Xiahou Dun at Meng Ford (Â≠üÊ¥•; present-day Mengjin County, Henan).Leban, p. 342 At the same time, Cao Cao sent Zang Ba to harass Qing Province (), which was governed by Yuan Shao's son Yuan Tan, to prevent his eastern flank from coming under attack. In the first month of 200, Liu Bei rebelled against Cao Cao and seized Xu Province after killing Che Zhou (), Cao Cao's appointed Inspector () of Xu Province. Cao Cao, in an unexpected move, left his northern front exposed to Yuan Shao and turned east to retake Xu Province. Yuan Shao tried to use the opportunity to start a campaign south, but was daunted by Yu Jin, the defender of Yan Ford. When Cao Cao returned to Guandu after his victory over Liu Bei, who sought refuge under Yuan Shao afterwards, Yuan Shao decided to renew the campaign against Cao Cao. The aide-de-camp () Tian Feng, who had urged Yuan Shao to attack Cao Cao while he was away, advised against such a campaign, reasoning that they had lost their chance and must wait. Yuan Shao ignored Tian Feng's repeated remonstrations and imprisoned him under charges of demoralizing the army. Shortly after, Yuan Shao had Chen Lin draft a document condemning Cao Cao in what was essentially a declaration of war, and marched his main army toward the forward base of Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ; northwest of present-day Xun County, Henan) north of the river. At the time, Yuan Shao's army boasted of numbers up to 110,000, including 10,000 cavalry.  Skirmishes along the Yellow River  Territories of Yuan Shao (red) and Cao Cao (blue) at the time of the battle Yuan Shao's general Yan Liang crossed the Yellow River and besieged Cao Cao's fort at Boma. Heeding his advisor Xun You's advice, Cao Cao led a battalion toward Yan Ford as a feint to trick Yuan Shao into believing that Cao Cao would attack his camp on the other side of the river. Yuan Shao split off his troops from Liyang to counter Cao Cao's attack, leaving Yan Liang without any support at Boma. Cao Cao then struck eastward to lift the siege on Boma. In the ensuing battle, Yan Liang was killed by Guan Yu and Yuan Shao's army was routed. Cao Cao decided to abandon the fort and evacuate its occupants to the south. Taking advantage of the situation, Wen Chou and Liu Bei led 6,000 horsemen in pursuit. Cao Cao anticipated the attack and prepared a distraction tactic. He ordered his troops to discard their steeds, weapons and other valuables along the way. Yuan Shao's forces broke their ranks to grab the valuables lying ahead. Just as they were claiming the items, 600 of Cao Cao's elite cavalry that had been lying in ambush attacked them. Yuan Shao's commander Wen Chou was killed and Liu Bei fled. Having lost two of their generals in these relatively minor skirmishes prior to the primary conflict at Guandu resulted in a crushing blow to the morale of Yuan Shao's army.  The advance on Yangwu and flanking attempts  Mural showing cavalry and chariots, from the Dahuting Tomb (Chinese: ÊâìËôé‰∫≠Ê±âÂ¢ì, Pinyin: Dahuting Han mu) of the late Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD), located in Zhengzhou, Henan province, China Despite having won the preliminary battles, Cao Cao was still outnumbered. He abandoned the forward bases along the Yellow River in preparation for a determined defence at Guandu. Cao Cao also ordered his officials in charge of his lands in his absence to govern with lenience, so as to minimise chances of chaos within the civilian community that could affect his army's morale. After the engagements at the river, Yuan Shao's army pushed to Yangwu (ÈôΩÊ≠¶; near present-day Yuanyang County, Henan), directly north of Guandu, and began constructing earthen fortifications. He ignored Cheng Yu's bastion of 700 men at Juancheng and missed an opportunity to attack Cao Cao's eastern flank,Leban, p. 360 exactly as Cheng Yu's predicted earlier when he guessed that Yuan Shao would ignore a position with so few men. Yuan Shao's Attendant Officer () Ju Shou had reservations about concentrating all of the main army at Yangwu, and suggested leaving a garrison at Yan Ford as a precaution in case the attack on Guandu did not go well. Yuan Shao ignored the suggestion again. Ju Shou, in despair, tried to excuse himself by claiming to be ill, but Yuan Shao became annoyed at him and would not grant him leave. Instead, he divested Ju Shou's men and divided them under the commands of Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong. Yuan Shao reorganized his forces and sent Liu Bei with an army to support the rebellions against Cao Cao in Yinjiang („∂èÁñÜ; southwest of present-day Xuchang), just 20 li south of the capital. Although Cao Cao was concerned about such developments in his rear, his cousin Cao Ren observed that Liu Bei could not have too much control over his new men given by Yuan Shao. So Cao Cao sent Cao Ren to deal with the rebellion. Cao Ren succeeded, killing the rebel leader Liu Pi and routing Liu Bei. Yuan Shao also tried to cut off Cao Cao from the west by sending Han Meng ()Variously recorded as Han Xun (ÈüìËçÄ) or Han Ruo (ÈüìËã•). Leban, p. 364 southwest. Cao Ren again responded to the threat by defeating Han Meng at Mount Jiluo (ÈõûÊ¥õÂ±±; 50 li northeast of present-day Xinmi, Henan). Yuan Shao did not send any detached force into Cao Cao's territory after this. At Yangwu, several war plans were presented to Yuan Shao. Ju Shou observed that Cao Cao's men were running out of grain, and thus it would be proper to enter a war of attrition, denying Cao Cao a decisive battle. Another advisor, Xu You suggested that Yuan Shao should maintain the front at Guandu but at the same time send men to circle around and capture the emperor in Xu. Yuan Shao accepted neither plan, saying he preferred to capture the emperor with a direct advance. The siege of Guandu In the eighth month, Yuan Shao's army slowly advanced southward from Yangwu and engaged Cao Cao's men in trench warfare, behind the earthen embankments that both sides made. Both sides harassed each other with engines of war. Yuan Shao had erected siege-ramps and high platforms which allowed his men to rain arrows onto Cao Cao's forces. In response, Cao Cao's men had to carry their shields above their heads, and retaliated with traction trebuchets that destroyed the archer platforms. Yuan Shao also tried to tunnel under Cao Cao's fort, but Cao Cao had a large ditch dug within his lines to block the tunnels. Subsequently, neither side could overcome each other as Cao Cao and Yuan Shao became locked in a stalemate. Before long, Cao Cao's army began to run short of supplies and Cao Cao was in a dilemma on whether to retreat in order to lure Yuan Shao deeper into his territory. Xun Yu, the defender of the capital Xu, sent Cao Cao a letter dissuading him from retreat. He wrote, drawing historical examples from the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention: Cao Cao followed this advice and held fast to his ground. In the ninth month,Leban. p. 366 Xun Yu pointed out that Yuan Shao had been storing supplies at a depot in the village of Gushi (ÊïÖÂ∏Ç; southwest of present-day Yanjin County, Henan), guarded by Han Meng. Cao Cao sent out small cavalry units led by Xu Huang and Shi Huan () to attack this position. They succeeded, routing Han Meng, disrupting Yuan Shao's supply lines, and burning his grain carts. Yuan Shao was forced to call for relief supplies in response to this raid. The raid on Wuchao In the tenth month, Yuan Shao's general Chunyu Qiong returned with an army of 10,000 from Hebei escorting large reserves of food supplies. Yuan Shao ordered Chunyu to escort the supplies to Wuchao (ÁÉèÂ∑¢; in present-day Yanjin County, Henan), a place 40 li away from Guandu near Gushi, and placed him in charge of guarding the supplies there. Yuan Shao's advisor Ju Shou argued that Wuchao, being their important supply depot, was too lightly guarded and insisted that Yuan Shao should send the general Jiang Qi () to serve as a perimeter guard to Chunyu Qiong and cut off any potential raids. Yuan Shao, again, did not heed Ju Shou's advice. Shortly after, Yuan Shao's advisor Xu You, who had harboured dissatisfaction against Yuan Shao for not following his plan and having his wife arrested by Shen Pei, defected over to Cao Cao. He understood Cao Cao's shortage of supplies and alerted Cao Cao to Yuan Shao's exploitable weakness at Wuchao. Cao Cao's generals were suspicious of this piece of intelligence, but his advisors Xun You and Jia Xu urged Cao Cao to put Xu You's plan to action. Thus at night, Cao Cao led 5,000 infantry and cavalry to attack Wuchao after leaving Cao Hong and Xun You in charge of his main camp at Guandu. Cao Cao's army disguised itself as a reinforcement unit from Yuan Shao and attacked Wuchao. Chunyu Qiong's initial defences were overrun, and he retreated to hold his forts, which Cao Cao attacked and set on fire. When Yuan Shao's camp received the news that Wuchao was under attack, Zhang He urged Yuan Shao to send reinforcements to Wuchao to save the supplies, on which the fate of the campaign hinged. Guo Tu, however, advocated the opposite: attack Cao Cao's base at Guandu with the hope that Cao Cao will abandon the raid on Wuchao. Yuan Shao used Guo Tu's idea and sent Zhang He and Gao Lan to lead his main army to attack Cao Cao's main camp at Guandu, while only sending a small cavalry unit to reinforce Wuchao. Cao Cao ignored pleas to split off his force to deal with the reinforcements and readied his men to fight to the death. The raid on Wuchao was a great success, inflicting over a thousand casualties. Yuan Shao's officers L√º Weihuang (), Han Juzi (), Sui Yuanjin (), and Zhao Rui () were decapitated; Chunyu Qiong was captured by Yue Jin and had his nose cut off. Almost all of Yuan Shao's food supplies at Wuchao were burnt. By dawn, Wuchao had turned into an inferno and the morale of Yuan Shao's army plummeted sharply due to the loss of food supplies. Cao Cao also cut off the noses of the dead, mixed them with noses and lips of oxen and horses, and showed them to Yuan Shao's men, as a form of intimidation. Meanwhile, at Guandu, Yuan Shao's army led by Zhang He and Gao Lan failed to break through the enemy lines. Affected by the news of the defeat in Wuchao and rumors of Guo Tu making slanderous remarks about them, Zhang He and Gao Lan surrendered to Cao Hong and destroyed their weapons. Cao Cao's forces seized the opportunity to launch the full attack on Yuan's army. Yuan Shao's numerous armies were destroyed and much of his supplies were captured by Cao Cao. Yuan Shao himself fled north across the Yellow River with only about 800 cavalry, which was what was left of his army. Order was restored only when Yuan Shao reached the camp of his general Jiang Yiqu (), from where he gathered his straggling troops. Some of Yuan Shao's men could not cross the Yellow River in time and were captured by Cao Cao, including Ju Shou. Some of these men had feigned surrender so they could escape later, thus Cao Cao had these men buried alive. In his proclamation of victory to Emperor Xian, Cao Cao claimed to have killed 70,000 enemy troops.  Aftermath  Cao Cao's victory at the Battle of Guandu was a decisive one and marked the turn of the tide in his struggle for power with Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao died two years later and his youngest son Yuan Shang was made his successor. His oldest son Yuan Tan was furious with the succession and fought with his younger brother. This resulted in internal conflict within Yuan Shao's forces. Yuan Shao's pool of talented advisors and generals were also divided into two factions by the conflict ‚Äì one supported Yuan Shang and the other supported Yuan Tan. Cao Cao seized the opportunity to launch an attack on Yuan Tan's base at Liyang. Though Cao Cao eventually withdrew, Yuan Tan came to resent Yuan Shang even more during course of the battle, which led to open warfare between the brothers. Yuan Tan eventually allied with to Cao Cao against Yuan Shang, but Cao Cao accused him of violating some terms of the alliance and killed him in battle. On the other hand, Yuan Shang suffered defeats at the hands of Cao Cao and fled north to join his second brother Yuan Xi. Cao Cao's forces pursued them and defeated the Wuhuan tribe, the Yuan brothers' ally, in the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi fled to Liaodong to seek shelter under the warlord Gongsun Kang in 207, but Gongsun killed them instead and sent their heads to Cao Cao. By then, most of northern China was unified under Cao Cao's control, and Cao Cao could begin to turn his attention to the south.  Legacy and analysis  Throughout the ages, Cao Cao's impressive victory at Guandu, the climactic event of his life, has drawn analysis by both historical commentators and militarists hoping to imitate his success. The Song dynasty historian Sima Guang, compiler of the chronicle Zizhi Tongjian, remarked that while Yuan Shao was generous, elegant and able, he was also obstinate, self- satisfied, and seldom heeded reasonable advice. These negative attributes were the cause of his defeat.de Crespigny (1996), Jian'an 5: HH In more recent times, both the Chinese Nationalists and Communists have picked up on this battle and made their own interpretations, in various degrees of objectivity. The Nationalists followed traditional Chinese historiography in that they judged the battle in terms of personalities, rather than the situations and the tactics involved. For example, Cao Cao was seen as capable, decisive, and far-sighted, while Yuan Shao was derided as mediocre, slow, arrogant, and unable to employ men properly. The Communist leader Mao Zedong, in his writings about strategic retreat, used the Battle of Guandu along with the Battle of Chenggao, Battle of Kunyang, Battle of Red Cliffs, Battle of Xiaoting, and Battle of Fei River to illustrate the concept. In all of these battles, he wrote, \\"...the contestants were unequal in strength, and the weaker one yielding a step at first, pinned down the stronger one through delayed action and defeated him.\\"Selected Works of Mao Zedong, I, pp. 197‚Äì98. Cited in Leban, p. 377 Mao's words attracted some attention to the battle, and many papers were written to analyze the Battle of Guandu in Maoist terms. The Maoist interpretation, while taking note of Yuan Shao's serious errors of judgement, advocates that the strong enemy will make fateful errors, while the weaker opponent need only to await their appearance.Leban, p. 378 The Marxist interpretation portrays Yuan Shao as the representative of the great landlord- official class, and Cao Cao as of the middle and small landlord class. The battle was thus a product of class conflict in which Yuan Shao's fall was inevitable.Leban, p. 379 The historian Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao's victory to one single strategic decision ‚Äî the defender's choice of location. Leban asserts that Cao Cao chose Guandu as the place to make his stand because of his superior understanding of the relation between topography, logistics, and tactics over Yuan Shao. It was the issue about logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao's supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.Leban, p. 380 The Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny is skeptical of the traditional viewpoint and questions Yuan Shao's supposed advantage over Cao Cao. De Crespigny argues that Yuan Shao's hold on his nominal territories were not as secure as Cao Cao, who had aggressively campaigned to stabilize his surroundings. Taking note that Yuan Shao took ten years to eliminate the isolated Gongsun Zan, de Crespigny suggests that it was not due to indecisiveness that Yuan Shao did not take advantage of Cao Cao's temporal weaknesses, but that Yuan Shao might not have had the men to spare for such ventures. From such a perspective, Yuan Shao, faced with the ever-growing threat of his former ally Cao Cao, concentrated his force in a direct approach to Cao Cao's headquarters in hope that such a strike would overwhelm his enemy. Though he was outwitted and defeated by Cao Cao, Yuan Shao's decisions might not have been so foolish as numerous traditional historians and commentators have said.de Crespigny (2010), pp. 147-152 In popular culture The battle is featured as a playable stage in Koei's video game series Dynasty Warriors as one of the highlights of Cao Cao's story mode. In the fifth installment Boma, Yan Ford, and Guandu are defended by Cao Cao, Xiahou Dun, and Cao Pi respectively. In the seventh installment, the battle clearly focuses on Cao Pi's point of view, where he leads the attack on Wuchao, defeating and recruiting Zhang He (who'd been its defender instead of attacking Cao Cao's camp as in history).

This is done to protect people with allergies, and so that people can practice moral purchasing. Mandatory labelling is mandated in most developed nations and increasingly also in developing nations, especially for food products, e.g. \\"Grade A\\" meats. With regard to food and drugs, mandatory labelling has been a major battleground between consumer advocates and corporations since the late 19th century. Because of past scandals involving deceptive labelling, countries like the United States and Canada require most processed foods to have a nutrition facts label on the label, and the table's formatting and content must conform to strict guidelines. The European Union equivalent is the slightly different nutrition information table, which may also be supplemented with standardized icons indicating the presence of allergens. In China, all clothing is labelled with the factory of origin, including telephone and fax numbers, although this information is not available to buyers outside China, who see only a generic Made in China tag. The development genetically modified food has led to one of the most persistent and divisive debates about mandatory labelling, which is one of the central topics in genetically modified food controversies. Advocates of such labelling claim that the consumer should make the choice whether to expose themselves to any possible health risk from consuming such foods. Detractors point to studies that conclude genetically modified food is safe, and point out that for many commodity products, the identity of the grower and the custody chain are not known. Voluntary labelling and co-marketing of products deemed desirable is another matter usually carried out by entirely different means, e.g. Slow Food. There has been increased regulatory interest in substantiating these claims, and in some jurisdictions, food labels require regulatory approval before use. An interesting halfway is those labels that are considered mandatory by one buying population and effectively preclude purchase if they are not there, e.g. kosher, vegan, and the aforementioned GMO-free label now seen on many organic products.

They are all special cases of decompositions over an orthonormal basis of an inner product space. Here we consider that of square-integrable functions defined on an interval of the real line, which is important, among others, for interpolation theory. Definition Consider a set of square- integrable functions with values in \\\\mathbb{F}=\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\mbox{ or }\\\\mathbb{R}, :\\\\Phi = \\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_n:[a,b]\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{F}\\\\\\\\}_{n=0}^\\\\infty, which are pairwise orthogonal for the inner product :\\\\langle f, g\\\\rangle_w = \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\,\\\\overline{g}(x)\\\\,w(x)\\\\,dx where w(x) is a weight function, and \\\\overline\\\\cdot represents complex conjugation, i.e. \\\\overline{g}(x)=g(x) for \\\\mathbb{F}=\\\\mathbb{R}. The generalized Fourier series of a square-integrable function f: [a, b] ‚Üí \\\\mathbb{F}, with respect to Œ¶, is then :f(x) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty c_n\\\\varphi_n(x), where the coefficients are given by :c_n = {\\\\langle f, \\\\varphi_n \\\\rangle_w\\\\over \\\\\\\\varphi_n\\\\_w^2}. If Œ¶ is a complete set, i.e., an orthonormal basis of the space of all square-integrable functions on [a, b], as opposed to a smaller orthonormal set, the relation \\\\sim \\\\, becomes equality in the L¬≤ sense, more precisely modulo ¬∑w (not necessarily pointwise, nor almost everywhere).  Example (Fourier‚ÄìLegendre series)  The Legendre polynomials are solutions to the Sturm‚ÄìLiouville problem : \\\\left((1-x^2)P_n'(x)\\\\right)'+n(n+1)P_n(x)=0 and because of Sturm- Liouville theory, these polynomials are eigenfunctions of the problem and are solutions orthogonal with respect to the inner product above with unit weight. So we can form a generalized Fourier series (known as a Fourier‚ÄìLegendre series) involving the Legendre polynomials, and :f(x) \\\\sim \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty c_n P_n(x), :c_n = {\\\\langle f, P_n \\\\rangle_w\\\\over \\\\P_n\\\\_w^2} As an example, let us calculate the Fourier‚ÄìLegendre series for ∆í(x) = cos x over [‚àí1, 1]. Now, : \\\\begin{align} c_0 & = {\\\\int_{-1}^1 \\\\cos{x}\\\\,dx \\\\over \\\\int_{-1}^1 (1)^2 \\\\,dx} = \\\\sin{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 & = {\\\\int_{-1}^1 x \\\\cos{x}\\\\,dx \\\\over \\\\int_{-1}^1 x^2 \\\\, dx} = {0 \\\\over 2/3 } =0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_2 & = {\\\\int_{-1}^1 {3x^2 - 1 \\\\over 2} \\\\cos{x} \\\\, dx \\\\over \\\\int_{-1}^1 {9x^4-6x^2+1 \\\\over 4} \\\\, dx} = {6 \\\\cos{1} - 4\\\\sin{1} \\\\over 2/5 } \\\\end{align} and a series involving these terms :c_2P_2(x)+c_1P_1(x)+c_0P_0(x)= {5 \\\\over 2} (6 \\\\cos{1} - 4\\\\sin{1})\\\\left({3x^2 - 1 \\\\over 2}\\\\right) + \\\\sin1 := \\\\left({45 \\\\over 2} \\\\cos{1} - 15 \\\\sin{1}\\\\right)x^2+6 \\\\sin{1} - {15 \\\\over 2}\\\\cos{1} which differs from cos x by approximately 0.003, about 0\\\\. It may be advantageous to use such Fourier‚ÄìLegendre series since the eigenfunctions are all polynomials and hence the integrals and thus the coefficients are easier to calculate.

Disaster struck however two weeks into the broadcast when, on Friday 13 June 2003, the ship ran aground off Tory Island off the north-west coast near County Donegal. Cabin Fever consisted of a group of eleven contestants chosen specially for the show, most of whom had no sailing experience (though they had received a quick course in sailing technique prior to setting sail), who were to be put on the 27.4 metre (90 foot), two-masted schooner with a professional crew of two. The wind-powered sailing ship would then sail around the Irish coast. Each week one contestant was scheduled to quite literally \\"walk the plank\\" after being voted off the ship by TV viewers. The final surviving contestant was to be considered the winner and would receive ‚Ç¨100,000. The show was named after cabin fever, the claustrophobic reaction that takes place when a person or group is isolated and/or shut in a small space, with nothing to do, for an extended period. The ships The Cabin Fever was built in 1947 in France. It was heavily refurbished for the programme. The Cabin Fever II was brought from Dartmouth. It was registered as the Johanna Lucretia.

All the 9 remaining contestants1 and two crew were rescued by the nearby Arranmore Lifeboat, but the wooden sailing ship broke up on the rocks. Ironically the accident was not filmed by the RT√â film crew; they had left the ship some hours earlier to catch some sleep after 15 hours continuous filming. The incident was however filmed by a local man who happened to have been recording the schooner's movements at the moment she ran aground. The Irish media made much tongue-in- cheek mention of the fact that the disaster occurred on Friday the 13th, a date often linked to supposed curses and disasters and also the fact that the ship's name had been changed for the programme: sailing lore suggests that any ship which is renamed prior to setting sail will meet with disaster. Stuart Switzer, a Coco Television Productions producer responsible for the programme said: > ‚ÄúThe back of the boat has broken. It is actually in two pieces, and the > waves are knocking the planks and timber around. There is debris all over > the water and all over the shore.‚Äù =Aftermath= RT√â and the programme makers, Coco TV, announced that all money earned from phone-in votes in the previous week (and which, due to the disaster, would not now lead to some contestant leaving the ship on 16 June as planned), would be donated to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which supplies lifeboat coverage around the Irish coast. RT√â and Coco TV hired a second boat. The captain, Peter Culleton, was replaced and the show began again, though three of the original team declined to come back. They were replaced by two new contestants. The series was further hit when the boat experienced engine trouble and required a new gearbox but the problem was ultimately solved. Partly due to the controversies, the series regularly topped the TAM ratings on RT√â. =Reaction= Barry Andrews, a politician from the then governing Fianna F√°il party, questioned \\"the wisdom of sending out 11 people with no sailing experience with just two qualified sailors.\\" He said the destruction of the ship \\"shows that so-called reality television has gone too far, with people being asked to carry out challenges that are too dangerous.\\" =Report= Almost two years later, in March 2005, a report on the ship's sinking was published by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The report stated that the schooner breached its operating licence and had no effective watchkeeping. It also found that the contestants were fatigued at the time of the accident.

Robert Graves, Lawrence and the Arabs, op.cit. to be titled Seven Pillars of Wisdom. When war broke out, it was still incomplete and Lawrence stated that he ultimately destroyed the manuscript although he remained keen on using his original title Seven Pillars of Wisdom for his later work. The book had to be rewritten three times, once following the loss of the manuscript on a train at Reading.

With the support of Emir Faisal and his tribesmen, he helped organise and carry out attacks on the Ottoman forces from Aqaba in the south to Damascus in the north. Many sites inside the Wadi Rum area have been named after Lawrence to attract tourists, although there is little or no evidence connecting him to any of these places, including the rock formations near the entrance now known as \\"The Seven Pillars\\".The Seven Pillars? roughguides.com, accessed 19 June 2018 Speculation surrounds the book's dedication, a poem written by Lawrence and edited by Robert Graves, concerning whether it is to an individual or to the whole Arab race. It begins, \\"To S.A.\\", possibly meaning Selim Ahmed, a young Arab boy from Syria of whom Lawrence was very fond. Ahmed died, probably from typhus, aged 19, a few weeks before the offensive to liberate Damascus. Lawrence received the news of his death some days before he entered Damascus. > I loved you, so I drew these tides of > Men into my hands > And wrote my will across the > Sky in stars > To earn you freedom, the seven > Pillared worthy house, > That your eyes might be > Shining for me > When I came > > Death seemed my servant on the > Road, 'til we were near > And saw you waiting: > When you smiled and in sorrowful > Envy he outran me > And took you apart: > Into his quietness > > Love, the way-weary, groped to your body, > Our brief wage > Ours for the moment > Before Earth's soft hand explored your shape > And the blind > Worms grew fat upon > Your substance > > Men prayed me that I set our work, > The inviolate house, > As a memory of you > But for fit monument I shattered it, > Unfinished: and now > The little things creep out to patch > Themselves hovels > In the marred shadow > Of your gift. > A variant last line of that first stanza‚Äîreading, \\"When we came\\"‚Äîappears in some editions; however, the 1922 Oxford text (considered the definitive version; see below) has \\"When I came\\". The poem originated as prose, submitted by letter to Graves, who edited the work heavily into its current form, rewriting an entire stanza and correcting the others. Manuscripts and editions Lawrence kept extensive notes throughout the course of his involvement in the Revolt. He began work on a clean narrative in the first half of 1919 while in Paris for the Peace Conference and, later that summer, while back in Egypt. By December 1919, he had a fair draft of most of the ten books that make up the Seven Pillars of Wisdom but lost it (except for the introduction and final two books) when he misplaced his briefcase while changing trains at Reading railway station.Robert Graves (op. cit) refers to this incident not as a misplacement but as a theft: \\"[Lawrence] has never imagined a political motive for the theft, but his friends have. They even whisper darkly that one day the lost text may reappear in certain official archives.\\"Jeremy Wilson, author of Lawrence's authorised biography, also describes it as having been stolen. Jeremy Wilson: T. E. Lawrence STUDIES Seven Pillars of Wisdom- triumph and tragedy telstudies.org, accessed 19 June 2018 National newspapers alerted the public to the loss of the \\"hero's manuscript\\", but to no avail; the draft remained lost. Lawrence refers to this version as \\"Text I\\" and says that had it been published, it would have been some 250,000 words in length. In early 1920, Lawrence set about the daunting task of rewriting as much as he could remember of the first version. Working from memory alone (he had destroyed many of his wartime notes upon completion of the corresponding parts of Text I), he was able to complete this \\"Text II\\", 400,000 words long, in three months. Lawrence described this version as \\"hopelessly bad\\" in literary terms, but historically it was \\"substantially complete and accurate\\". This manuscript, titled by Lawrence \\"The Arab Revolt,\\" is held by the Harry Ransom Center with a letter from Lawrence's brother authenticating it as the earliest surviving manuscript of what would become Seven Pillars of Wisdom. With Text II in front of him, Lawrence began working on a polished version (\\"Text III\\") in London, Jeddah, and Amman during 1921. Lawrence completed this text comprising 335,000 words in February 1922. To eliminate any risk of losing the manuscript again, and to have copies that he could show privately to critics, he considered having the book typed out. However, he discovered that it would be cheaper to get the text typeset and printed on a proofing press at the Oxford Times printing works. Just eight copies were produced, of which six survive. In bibliographical terms the result was the first \\"edition\\" of Seven Pillars (because the text was reproduced on a printing press). In legal terms, however, these substitutes for a typescript were not \\"published\\". Lawrence retained ownership of all the copies and chose who was allowed to read them. The proof-printing became known as the \\"Oxford Text\\" of Seven Pillars. As a text it is unsatisfactory because Lawrence could not afford to have the proof corrected. It therefore contains innumerable transcription errors, and in places lines and even whole paragraphs are missing. He made corrections by hand in five of the copies and had them bound.Jeremy Wilson: T. E. Lawrence STUDIES Seven Pillars of Wisdom- triumph and tragedy telstudies.org, accessed 19 June 2018 (In 2001, the last time one of these rough printings came on to the market, it fetched almost US$1 million at auction.) Instead of burning the manuscript, Lawrence presented it to the Bodleian Library in Oxford. By mid-1922, Lawrence was in a state of severe mental turmoil: the psychological after-effects of war were taking their toll, as were his exhaustion from the literary endeavours of the past three years, his disillusionment with the settlement given to his Arab comrades-in-arms, and the burdens of being in the public eye as a perceived \\"national hero\\". It was at this time that he re-enlisted in the armed forces under an assumed name, for the most part in the Royal Air Force, as described in his book The Mint with the byline \\"by 352087 A/c Ross\\", with a period in the Royal Tank Corps as \\"Private Shaw\\". Concerned over his mental state and eager for his story to be read by a wider public, his friends persuaded him to produce an abridged version of Seven Pillars, to serve as both intellectual stimulation and a source of much-needed income. In his off-duty evenings, he set to trimming the 1922 text down to 250,000 words for a subscribers' edition. The Subscribers' Edition ‚Äì in a limited print run of about 200 copies, each with a unique, sumptuous, hand-crafted binding ‚Äì was published in late 1926, with the subtitle A Triumph. It was printed in London by Roy Manning Pike and Herbert John Hodgson, with illustrations by Eric Kennington, Augustus John, Paul Nash, Blair Hughes-Stanton and his wife Gertrude Hermes. Copies occasionally become available in the antiquarian trade and can easily command prices of up to US$100,000. Unfortunately, each copy cost Lawrence three times the thirty guineas the subscribers had paid.\\"He was so keen to do things well that he actually spent ¬£13,000 on the edition - the reproduction of the pictures alone cost him more than the subscriptions - leaving him ¬£10,000 out of pocket.\\" Graves, op. cit. The Subscribers' Edition was 25% shorter than the Oxford Text, but Lawrence did not abridge uniformly. The deletions from the early books are much less drastic than those of the later ones: for example, Book I lost 17% of its words and Book IV lost 21%, compared to 50% and 32% for Books VIII and IX. Critics differed in their opinions of the two editions: Robert Graves, E. M. Forster and George Bernard Shaw preferred the 1922 text (although, from a legal standpoint, they appreciated the removal of certain passages that could have been considered libellous, or at least indiscreet), while Edward Garnett preferred the 1926 version. Literary merits aside, however, producing the Subscribers' Edition had left Lawrence facing bankruptcy. He was forced to undertake an even more stringent pruning to produce a version for sale to the general public: this was the 1927 Revolt in the Desert, a work of some 130,000 words: \\"an abridgement of an abridgement,\\" remarked George Bernard Shaw, not without disdain. Nevertheless, it received wide acclaim by the public and critics alike, the vast majority of whom had never seen or read the unabridged Subscribers' Edition. After the 1926 release of the Subscribers' Edition, Lawrence stated that no further issue of Seven Pillars would be made during his lifetime. Lawrence was killed in a motorcycle accident in May 1935, at the age of 46, and within weeks of his death, the 1926 abridgement was published for general circulation. The unabridged Oxford Text of 1922 was not published until 1997, when it appeared as a \\"best text\\" edited by Jeremy Wilson from the manuscript in the Bodleian Library and Lawrence's amended copy of the 1922 proof printing.

He came to Britain at the age of 20 to train at the Old Vic theatre school. While there he met fellow students Casper Wrede and Richard Negri (co- founders of the Royal Exchange 25 years later). Work in the theatre After seasons at the Bristol Old Vic and the Piccolo Theatre in Manchester he started to collaborate with the directors Michael Elliott and Casper Wrede, initially with the 59 Theatre Company. He translated Georg B√ºchner's Danton's Death (original title: Dantons Tod) for the opening production at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. Elliott and Wrede went on to run the Old Vic company and Maxwell joined them to act in several of the productions including The Merchant of Venice and Measure for Measure. The group then joined with Braham Murray in Manchester to form the 69 Theatre Company. Maxwell adapted Daniel Deronda; directed by Elliott and starring Vanessa Redgrave it was subsequently televised. He acted in many productions for the company including Prospero in The Tempest in 1969 and Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons in 1975. He also directed Arms and the Man with Tom Courtenay, Jenny Agutter and Brian Cox in 1973. Based upon the success of this collaboration the group started to look for a permanent theatre in Manchester and eventually a new theatre was built inside the disused Royal Exchange with Maxwell as one of the founding artistic directors. He appeared in both the opening productions: Kleist's The Prince of Homburg (original title: Der Prinz von Homburg) and Sheridan's The Rivals and remained an artistic director until his death in 1995. As well as acting in many productions over the course of 20 years, he adapted several novels including The Count of Monte Cristo, Pride and Prejudice and The Moonstone. He also directed over 20 productions. As Braham Murray recalled. \\"As an artist he was multi-talented and practised each of his skills with discretion. As a writer, he translated many works; as a director he was particularly skilful at comedy. He loved to make people laugh, but it was as an actor that he would want to be remembered.\\"The Royal Exchange Theatre Company Words & Pictures 1976‚Äì1998Braham Murray Autobiography =Theatre Productions at the Royal Exchange= The productions directed by Maxwell during his time as artistic director include: * Present Laughter by No√´l Coward with Albert Finney (1977) * The Skin of Our Teeth by Thornton Wilder.

His best-known television role was as King Henry VII in a BBC2 drama series, The Shadow of the Tower, but it did not have the same level of success as The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), which was its predecessor drama. His other television credits include a prominent role in the Doctor Who story Underworld (1978). He also appeared as Osmond in a television serial of Henry James' The Portrait of a Lady (1968), The Avengers and The Saint. He played General-Major von Wittke in an episode of Enemy at the Door titled \\"Treason\\" (ep. 10, season 1, aired March 25, 1978). He was also seen in the films Private Potter (1962), The Evil of Frankenstein (1964), Otley (1968) and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1970). The first and last of these directed by his friend and colleague Casper Wrede. Personal life He married the actress Avril Elgar in 1952 and the couple had two sons. They met at the Old Vic theatre school and she appeared in many of Maxwell's productions. He died in 1995.

It is named after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. The graph of a Gaussian is a characteristic symmetric \\"bell curve\\" shape. The parameter is the height of the curve's peak, is the position of the center of the peak and (the standard deviation, sometimes called the Gaussian RMS width) controls the width of the \\"bell\\". Gaussian functions are often used to represent the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable with expected value and variance . In this case, the Gaussian is of the form: : g(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\exp{\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{(x-\\\\mu)^2}{\\\\sigma^2} \\\\right)}. Gaussian functions are widely used in statistics to describe the normal distributions, in signal processing to define Gaussian filters, in image processing where two-dimensional Gaussians are used for Gaussian blurs, and in mathematics to solve heat equations and diffusion equations and to define the Weierstrass transform.  Properties  Gaussian functions arise by composing the exponential function with a concave quadratic function: :f(x) = \\\\exp{\\\\left( \\\\alpha x^2 +\\\\beta x +\\\\gamma \\\\right)} where: :\\\\alpha=-0.5/c^2 :\\\\beta=b/c^2 :\\\\gamma=0.5(\\\\log(a)-b^2)/c^2 The Gaussian functions are thus those functions whose logarithm is a concave quadratic function. The parameter is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak according to : \\\\mathrm{FWHM} = 2 \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\ln 2}\\\\ c \\\\approx 2.35482 c. The function may then be expressed in terms of the FWHM, represented by : : f(x) = a e^{-4 (\\\\ln 2) (x-b)^2/w^2 } Alternatively, the parameter can be interpreted by saying that the two inflection points of the function occur at and . The full width at tenth of maximum (FWTM) for a Gaussian could be of interest and is : \\\\mathrm{FWTM} = 2 \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\ln 10}\\\\ c \\\\approx 4.29193 c. Gaussian functions are analytic, and their limit as is 0 (for the above case of ). Gaussian functions are among those functions that are elementary but lack elementary antiderivatives; the integral of the Gaussian function is the error function. Nonetheless their improper integrals over the whole real line can be evaluated exactly, using the Gaussian integral :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-x^2}\\\\,dx=\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} and one obtains :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty a e^{-(x-b)^2/(2c^2)}\\\\,dx=ac\\\\cdot\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}. This integral is 1 if and only if a = \\\\tfrac{1}{c\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} (the normalizing constant), and in this case the Gaussian is the probability density function of a normally distributed random variable with expected value and variance : : g(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} e^{ -(1/2)\\\\left((x-\\\\mu)/\\\\sigma\\\\right)^2 }. These Gaussians are plotted in the accompanying figure. Normalized Gaussian curves with expected value and variance . The corresponding parameters are a = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sigma\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}, and . Gaussian functions centered at zero minimize the Fourier uncertainty principle. The product of two Gaussian functions is a Gaussian, and the convolution of two Gaussian functions is also a Gaussian, with variance being the sum of the original variances: c^2 = c_1^2 + c_2^2. The product of two Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs), though, is not in general a Gaussian PDF. Taking the Fourier transform (unitary, angular frequency convention) of a Gaussian function with parameters , and yields another Gaussian function, with parameters c, and \\\\frac{1}{c}. So in particular the Gaussian functions with and c = 1 are kept fixed by the Fourier transform (they are eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform with eigenvalue 1). A physical realization is that of the diffraction pattern: for example, a photographic slide whose transmittance has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function. The fact that the Gaussian function is an eigenfunction of the continuous Fourier transform allows us to derive the following interesting identity from the Poisson summation formula: : \\\\sum_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\pi\\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{c}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) = c\\\\cdot\\\\sum_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z}}\\\\exp(-\\\\pi\\\\cdot(kc)^2).

First, the constant a can simply be factored out of the integral. Next, the variable of integration is changed from x to y = x - b. :a\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-y^2/2c^2}\\\\,dy and then to z=y/\\\\sqrt{2 c^2} :a\\\\sqrt{2 c^2} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-z^2}\\\\,dz Then, using the Gaussian integral identity :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-z^2}\\\\,dz = \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} we have :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty ae^{-(x-b)^2/2c^2}\\\\,dx=a\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi c^2}  Two-dimensional Gaussian function  Gaussian curve with a two- dimensional domain In two dimensions, the power to which e is raised in the Gaussian function is any negative-definite quadratic form. Consequently, the level sets of the Gaussian will always be ellipses. A particular example of a two-dimensional Gaussian function is :f(x,y) = A \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\left(\\\\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_X^2} + \\\\frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\right)\\\\right). Here the coefficient A is the amplitude, xo,yo is the center and œÉx, œÉy are the x and y spreads of the blob. The figure on the right was created using A = 1, xo = 0, yo = 0, œÉx = œÉy = 1. The volume under the Gaussian function is given by :V = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty f(x,y)\\\\,dx \\\\,dy=2 \\\\pi A \\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y. In general, a two-dimensional elliptical Gaussian function is expressed as :f(x,y) = A \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\left(a(x - x_o)^2 + 2b(x-x_o)(y-y_o) + c(y-y_o)^2 \\\\right)\\\\right) where the matrix :\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & c \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] is positive- definite. Using this formulation, the figure on the right can be created using A = 1, (xo, yo) = (0, 0), a = c = 1/2, b = 0. = Meaning of parameters for the general equation = For the general form of the equation the coefficient A is the height of the peak and (xo, yo) is the center of the blob. If we set : \\\\begin{align} a & = \\\\frac{\\\\cos^2\\\\theta}{2\\\\sigma_X^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{2\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] b & = -\\\\frac{\\\\sin2\\\\theta}{4\\\\sigma_X^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sin2\\\\theta}{4\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] c & = \\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}{2\\\\sigma_X^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\cos^2\\\\theta}{2\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\end{align} then we rotate the blob by a clockwise angle \\\\theta (for counterclockwise rotation invert the signs in the b coefficient). This can be seen in the following examples: {  \\\\theta = 0  \\\\theta = \\\\pi/6  \\\\theta = \\\\pi/3 } Using the following Octave code, one can easily see the effect of changing the parameters A = 1; x0 = 0; y0 = 0; sigma_X = 1; sigma_Y = 2; [X, Y] = meshgrid(-5:.1:5, -5:.1:5); for theta = 0:pi/100:pi a = cos(theta)^2/(2*sigma_X^2) + sin(theta)^2/(2*sigma_Y^2); b = -sin(2*theta)/(4*sigma_X^2) + sin(2*theta)/(4*sigma_Y^2); c = sin(theta)^2/(2*sigma_X^2) + cos(theta)^2/(2*sigma_Y^2); Z = A*exp( - (a*(X-x0).^2 + 2*b*(X-x0).*(Y-y0) + c*(Y-y0).^2)); surf(X,Y,Z);shading interp;view(-36,36) waitforbuttonpress end Such functions are often used in image processing and in computational models of visual system function‚Äîsee the articles on scale space and affine shn. Also see multivariate normal distribution. = Higher-order Gaussian or super-Gaussian function = A more general formulation of a Gaussian function with a flat-top and Gaussian fall- off can be taken by raising the content of the exponent to a power, P: f(x) = A \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\left(\\\\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_X^2}\\\\right)^P\\\\right). This function is known as a super-Gaussian function and is often used for Gaussian beam formulation.Parent, A., M. Morin, and P. Lavigne. \\"Propagation of super- Gaussian field distributions.\\" Optical and quantum electronics 24.9 (1992): S1071-S1079. In a two-dimensional formulation, a Gaussian function along x and y can be combined with potentially different P_X and P_Y to form an elliptical Gaussian distribution,f(x,y) = A \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\left(\\\\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_X^2} + \\\\frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\right)^P\\\\right) or a rectangular Gaussian distribution, f(x,y) = A \\\\exp\\\\left(- \\\\left(\\\\frac{(x-x_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_X^2}\\\\right)^{P_X} - \\\\left(\\\\frac{(y-y_o)^2}{2\\\\sigma_Y^2} \\\\right)^{P_Y}\\\\right).  Multi-dimensional Gaussian function  In an n-dimensional space a Gaussian function can be defined as : f(x) = \\\\exp(-x^TCx) \\\\;, where x=\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} is a column of n coordinates, C is a positive-definite n\\\\times n matrix, and {}^T denotes matrix transposition. The integral of this Gaussian function over the whole n-dimensional space is given as : \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} \\\\exp(-x^TCx) \\\\, dx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi^n}{\\\\det C}} \\\\;. It can be easily calculated by diagonalizing the matrix C and changing the integration variables to the eigenvectors of C. More generally a shifted Gaussian function is defined as : f(x) = \\\\exp(-x^TCx+s^Tx) \\\\;, where s=\\\\\\\\{s_1,\\\\dots,s_n\\\\\\\\} is the shift vector and the matrix C can be assumed to be symmetric, C^T=C, and positive-definite. The following integrals with this function can be calculated with the same technique, : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-x^T C x+v^Tx} \\\\, dx = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi^n}{\\\\det{C}}} \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{4}v^T C^{-1}v\\\\right)\\\\equiv \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\;. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T C x + v^T x} \\\\left( a^T x \\\\right) \\\\, dx = (a^T u) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\;,\\\\text{ where } u = \\\\frac{1}{2} C^{- 1} v \\\\;. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T C x + v^T x} (x^T D x) \\\\, dx = \\\\left( u^T D u + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\operatorname{tr} (D C^{- 1}) \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\;. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb{R}^n} e^{- x^T C' x + s'^T x} \\\\left( -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\Lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right) e^{-x^T C x + s^T x} \\\\, dx \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] = {} & \\\\left( 2 \\\\operatorname{tr} (C' \\\\Lambda C B^{- 1}) + 4 u^T C' \\\\Lambda C u - 2 u^T (C' \\\\Lambda s + C \\\\Lambda s') + s'^T \\\\Lambda s \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\mathcal{M}\\\\;,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\text{where } u = \\\\frac{1}{2} B^{- 1} v, v = s + s', B = C + C' \\\\;. \\\\end{align}  Estimation of parameters  A number of fields such as stellar photometry, Gaussian beam characterization, and emission/absorption line spectroscopy work with sampled Gaussian functions and need to accurately estimate the height, position, and width parameters of the function. There are three unknown parameters for a 1D Gaussian function (a, b, c) and five for a 2D Gaussian function (A; x_0,y_0; \\\\sigma_X,\\\\sigma_Y). The most common method for estimating the Gaussian parameters is to take the logarithm of the data and fit a parabola to the resulting data set.Hongwei Guo, \\"A simple algorithm for fitting a Gaussian function,\\" IEEE Sign. Proc. Mag. 28(9): 134-137 (2011). While this provides a simple curve fitting procedure, the resulting algorithm may be biased by excessively weighting small data values, which can produce large errors in the profile estimate. One can partially compensate for this problem through weighted least squares estimation, reducing the weight of small data values, but this too can be biased by allowing the tail of the Gaussian to dominate the fit. In order to remove the bias, one can instead use an iteratively reweighted least squares procedure, in which the weights are updated at each iteration. It is also possible to perform non-linear regression directly on the data, without involving the logarithmic data transformation; for more options, see probability distribution fitting. = Parameter precision = Once one has an algorithm for estimating the Gaussian function parameters, it is also important to know how precise those estimates are. Any least squares estimation algorithm can provide numerical estimates for the variance of each parameter (i.e., the variance of the estimated height, position, and width of the function). One can also use Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound theory to obtain an analytical expression for the lower bound on the parameter variances, given certain assumptions about the data.N. Hagen, M. Kupinski, and E. L. Dereniak, \\"Gaussian profile estimation in one dimension,\\" Appl. Opt. 46:5374‚Äì5383 (2007)N. Hagen and E. L. Dereniak, \\"Gaussian profile estimation in two dimensions,\\" Appl. Opt. 47:6842‚Äì6851 (2008) # The noise in the measured profile is either i.i.d. Gaussian, or the noise is Poisson-distributed. # The spacing between each sampling (i.e. the distance between pixels measuring the data) is uniform. # The peak is \\"well-sampled\\", so that less than 10% of the area or volume under the peak (area if a 1D Gaussian, volume if a 2D Gaussian) lies outside the measurement region. # The width of the peak is much larger than the distance between sample locations (i.e. the detector pixels must be at least 5 times smaller than the Gaussian FWHM). When these assumptions are satisfied, the following covariance matrix K applies for the 1D profile parameters a, b, and c under i.i.d. Gaussian noise and under Poisson noise: : \\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\text{Gauss}} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\delta_X Q^2} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{3}{2c} &0 &\\\\frac{-1}{a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\frac{2c}{a^2} &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1}{a} &0 &\\\\frac{2c}{a^2} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ , \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{K}_\\\\text{Poiss} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi}} \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{3a}{2c} &0 &-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\frac{c}{a} &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{1}{2} &0 &\\\\frac{c}{2a} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ , where \\\\delta_X is the width of the pixels used to sample the function, Q is the quantum efficiency of the detector, and \\\\sigma indicates the standard deviation of the measurement noise. Thus, the individual variances for the parameters are, in the Gaussian noise case, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{var} (a) &= \\\\frac{3 \\\\sigma^2}{2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\, \\\\delta_X Q^2 c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{var} (b) &= \\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma^2 c}{\\\\delta_X \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\, Q^2 a^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{var} (c) &= \\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma^2 c}{\\\\delta_X \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} \\\\, Q^2 a^2} \\\\end{align} and in the Poisson noise case, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{var} (a) &= \\\\frac{3a}{2 \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\, c} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{var} (b) &= \\\\frac{c}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\, a} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{var} (c) &= \\\\frac{c}{2 \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\, a}. \\\\end{align} For the 2D profile parameters giving the amplitude A, position (x_0,y_0), and width (\\\\sigma_X,\\\\sigma_Y) of the profile, the following covariance matrices apply: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{K}_\\\\text{Gauss} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{\\\\pi \\\\delta_X \\\\delta_Y Q^2} & \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y} &0 &0 &\\\\frac{-1}{A \\\\sigma_Y} &\\\\frac{-1}{A \\\\sigma_X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_X}{A^2 \\\\sigma_Y} &0 &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &0 &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_Y}{A^2 \\\\sigma_X} &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1}{A \\\\sigma_y} &0 &0 &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_X}{A^2 \\\\sigma_y} &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1}{A \\\\sigma_X} &0 &0 &0 &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_Y}{A^2 \\\\sigma_X} \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\operatorname{Poisson}} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} & \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{3A}{\\\\sigma_X \\\\sigma_Y} &0 &0 &\\\\frac{-1}{\\\\sigma_Y} &\\\\frac{-1}{\\\\sigma_X} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_X}{A \\\\sigma_Y} &0 &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 &0 &\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_Y}{A \\\\sigma_X} &0 &0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\sigma_Y} &0 &0 &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_X}{3A \\\\sigma_Y} &\\\\frac{1}{3A} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\sigma_X} &0 &0 &\\\\frac{1}{3A} &\\\\frac{2 \\\\sigma_Y}{3A \\\\sigma_X} \\\\end{pmatrix}. \\\\end{align} where the individual parameter variances are given by the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.  Discrete Gaussian  The discrete Gaussian kernel (solid), compared with the sampled Gaussian kernel (dashed) for scales t=0.5,1,2,4. One may ask for a discrete analog to the Gaussian; this is necessary in discrete applications, particularly digital signal processing. A simple answer is to sample the continuous Gaussian, yielding the sampled Gaussian kernel. However, this discrete function does not have the discrete analogs of the properties of the continuous function, and can lead to undesired effects, as described in the article scale space implementation. An alternative approach is to use the discrete Gaussian kernel:Lindeberg, T., \\"Scale-space for discrete signals,\\" PAMI(12), No. 3, March 1990, pp. 234‚Äì254. :T(n, t) = e^{-t} I_n(t) where I_n(t) denotes the modified Bessel functions of integer order. This is the discrete analog of the continuous Gaussian in that it is the solution to the discrete diffusion equation (discrete space, continuous time), just as the continuous Gaussian is the solution to the continuous diffusion equation.Campbell, J, 2007, The SMM model as a boundary value problem using the discrete diffusion equation, Theor Popul Biol. 2007 Dec;72(4):539‚Äì46. Applications Gaussian functions appear in many contexts in the natural sciences, the social sciences, mathematics, and engineering. Some examples include: * In statistics and probability theory, Gaussian functions appear as the density function of the normal distribution, which is a limiting probability distribution of complicated sums, according to the central limit theorem. * Gaussian functions are the Green's function for the (homogeneous and isotropic) diffusion equation (and to the heat equation, which is the same thing), a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of a mass-density under diffusion. Specifically, if the mass-density at time t=0 is given by a Dirac delta, which essentially means that the mass is initially concentrated in a single point, then the mass-distribution at time t will be given by a Gaussian function, with the parameter a being linearly related to 1/ and c being linearly related to ; this time-varying Gaussian is described by the heat kernel. More generally, if the initial mass-density is œÜ(x), then the mass-density at later times is obtained by taking the convolution of œÜ with a Gaussian function. The convolution of a function with a Gaussian is also known as a Weierstrass transform. * A Gaussian function is the wave function of the ground state of the quantum harmonic oscillator. * The molecular orbitals used in computational chemistry can be linear combinations of Gaussian functions called Gaussian orbitals (see also basis set (chemistry)). * Mathematically, the derivatives of the Gaussian function can be represented using Hermite functions. The n-th derivative of the Gaussian is the Gaussian function itself multiplied by the n-th Hermite polynomial, up to scale. * Consequently, Gaussian functions are also associated with the vacuum state in quantum field theory. * Gaussian beams are used in optical systems, microwave systems and lasers. * In scale space representation, Gaussian functions are used as smoothing kernels for generating multi-scale representations in computer vision and image processing. Specifically, derivatives of Gaussians (Hermite functions) are used as a basis for defining a large number of types of visual operations. * Gaussian functions are used to define some types of artificial neural networks. * In fluorescence microscopy a 2D Gaussian function is used to approximate the Airy disk, describing the intensity distribution produced by a point source. * In signal processing they serve to define Gaussian filters, such as in image processing where 2D Gaussians are used for Gaussian blurs. In digital signal processing, one uses a discrete Gaussian kernel, which may be defined by sampling a Gaussian, or in a different way. * In geostatistics they have been used for understanding the variability between the patterns of a complex training image. They are used with kernel methods to cluster the patterns in the feature space.Honarkhah, M and Caers, J, 2010, Stochastic Simulation of Patterns Using Distance-Based Pattern Modeling, Mathematical Geosciences, 42: 487‚Äì517 See also *Normal distribution *Lorentzian function *Radial basis function kernel  References  External links * Mathworld, includes a proof for the relations between c and FWHM Haskell, Erlang and Perl implementation of Gaussian distribution * Bensimhoun Michael, N-Dimensional Cumulative Function, And Other Useful Facts About Gaussians and Normal Densities (2009) *Code for fitting Gaussians in ImageJ and Fiji.

It is the simplest organic nitro compound. It is a polar liquid commonly used as a solvent in a variety of industrial applications such as in extractions, as a reaction medium, and as a cleaning solvent. As an intermediate in organic synthesis, it is used widely in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, explosives, fibers, and coatings. Nitromethane is used as a fuel additive in various motorsports and hobbies, e.g. Top Fuel drag racing and miniature internal combustion engines in radio control, control line and free flight model aircraft.  Preparation  Nitromethane is produced industrially by combining propane and nitric acid in the gas phase at 350‚Äì450 ¬∞C (662‚Äì842 ¬∞F). This exothermic reaction produces the four industrially significant nitroalkanes: nitromethane, nitroethane, 1-nitropropane, and 2-nitropropane. The reaction involves free radicals, including the alkoxyl radicals of the type CH3CH2CH2O, which arise via homolysis of the corresponding nitrite ester. These alkoxy radicals are susceptible to C‚ÄîC fragmentation reactions, which explains the formation of a mixture of products. =Laboratory methods= It can be prepared in other methods that are of instructional value. The reaction of sodium chloroacetate with sodium nitrite in aqueous solution produces this compound: :ClCH2COONa + NaNO2 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí CH3NO2 \\\\+ NaCl + NaHCO3 Uses The principal use of nitromethane is as a stabilizer for chlorinated solvents, which are used in dry cleaning, semiconductor processing, and degreasing. It is also used most effectively as a solvent or dissolving agent for acrylate monomers, such as cyanoacrylates (more commonly known as \\"super-glues\\"). It is also used as a fuel in some forms of racing. It can be used as an explosive, when gelled with several percent of gelling agent. This type of mixture is called PLX. Other mixtures include ANNM and ANNMAl ‚Äì explosive mixtures of ammonium nitrate, nitromethane and aluminium powder. As an organic solvent, it is considered to be highly polar (Œµr = 36 at 20 ¬∞C and Œº = 3.5 Debye) but is aprotic and possesses very low Lewis basicity. Thus, it is a rare example of a polar solvent that is also weakly coordinating. This makes it useful for dissolving positively charged, strongly electrophilic species. However, its relatively high acidity and explosive properties (see below) limit its applications. Reactions =Acid-base properties= Nitromethane is a relatively acidic carbon acid. It has a pKa of 17.2 in DMSO solution. This value indicates an aqueous pKa of about 11. The reason of that being so acidic is due to the resonance structure below: The anion is resonance stabilized It is slow to deprotonate. Protonation of the conjugate base O2NCH2‚àí, which is nearly isosteric with nitrate, occurs initially at oxygen. =Organic reactions= In organic synthesis nitromethane is employed as a one carbon building block. Its acidity allows it to undergo deprotonation, enabling condensation reactions analogous to those of carbonyl compounds. Thus, under base catalysis, nitromethane adds to aldehydes in 1,2-addition in the nitroaldol reaction. Some important derivatives include the pesticides chloropicrin (Cl3CNO2), beta-nitrostyrene, and tris(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, ((HOCH2)3CNO2). Reduction of the latter gives tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, (HOCH2)3CNH2, better known as tris, a widely used buffer. In more specialized organic synthesis, nitromethane serves as a Michael donor, adding to Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via 1,4-addition in the Michael reaction. =As an engine fuel= Nitromethane is used as a fuel in motor racing, particularly drag racing, as well as for radio-controlled models (such as cars, planes and helicopters). In this context, nitromethane is commonly referred to as \\"nitro\\", and is the principal ingredient for fuel used in the \\"Top Fuel\\" category of drag racing. The oxygen content of nitromethane enables it to burn with much less atmospheric oxygen than conventional fuels. During nitromethane combustion nitric oxide (NO) is one of the major emission products along with CO and HO. Recent (2020) studiessuggest the correct stoichiometric equation for the burning of nitromethane is: :4 CH3NO2 \\\\+ 5 O2 ‚Üí 4 CO2 \\\\+ 6 H2O + 4 NO The amount of air required to burn of gasoline is , but only of air is required for 1 kg of nitromethane. Since an engine's cylinder can only contain a limited amount of air on each stroke, 8.6 times as much nitromethane as gasoline can be burned in one stroke. Nitromethane, however, has a lower specific energy: gasoline provides about 42‚Äì44 MJ/kg, whereas nitromethane provides only 11.3 MJ/kg. This analysis indicates that nitromethane generates about 2.3 times the power of gasoline when combined with a given amount of oxygen. Nitromethane can also be used as a monopropellant, i.e., a fuel that burns without added oxygen. The following equation describes this process: :2 CH3NO2 ‚Üí 2 CO + 2 H2O + H2 \\\\+ N2 Nitromethane has a laminar combustion velocity of approximately 0.5 m/s, somewhat higher than gasoline, thus making it suitable for high-speed engines. It also has a somewhat higher flame temperature of about . The high heat of vaporization of 0.56 MJ/kg together with the high fuel flow provides significant cooling of the incoming charge (about twice that of methanol), resulting in reasonably low temperatures Nitromethane is usually used with rich air‚Äìfuel mixtures because it provides power even in the absence of atmospheric oxygen. When rich air‚Äìfuel mixtures are used, hydrogen and carbon monoxide are two of the combustion products. These gases often ignite, sometimes spectacularly, as the normally very rich mixtures of the still burning fuel exits the exhaust ports. Very rich mixtures are necessary to reduce the temperature of combustion chamber hot parts in order to control pre-ignition and subsequent detonation. Operational details depend on the particular mixture and engine characteristics. A small amount of hydrazine blended in nitromethane can increase the power output even further. With nitromethane, hydrazine forms an explosive salt that is again a monopropellant. This unstable mixture poses a severe safety hazard and the Academy of Model Aeronautics does not permit its use in competitions. In model aircraft and car glow fuel, the primary ingredient is generally methanol with some nitromethane (0% to 65%, but rarely over 30%, and 10‚Äì20% lubricants (usually castor oil and/or synthetic oil). Even moderate amounts of nitromethane tend to increase the power created by the engine (as the limiting factor is often the air intake), making the engine easier to tune (adjust for the proper air/fuel ratio). Explosive properties Nitromethane was not known to be a high explosive until a railroad tanker car loaded with it exploded on . After much testing, it was realized that nitromethane was a more energetic high explosive than TNT, although TNT has a higher velocity of detonation (VoD) and brisance. Both of these explosives are oxygen-poor, and some benefits are gained from mixing with an oxidizer, such as ammonium nitrate. Pure nitromethane is an insensitive explosive with a VoD of approximately , but even so inhibitors may be used to reduce the hazards. The tank car explosion was speculated to be due to adiabatic compression, a hazard common to all liquid explosives. This is when small entrained air bubbles compress and superheat with rapid rises in pressure. It was thought that an operator rapidly snapped shut a valve creating a \\"hammer-lock\\" pressure surge. Nitromethane can also be mixed with ammonium nitrate, which is used as an oxidizer, to form an explosive mixture known as ANNM. One graphic example of this was the use of nitromethane and ammonium nitrate in the Oklahoma City bombing. Nitromethane is used as a model explosive, along with TNT. It has several advantages as a model explosive over TNT, namely its uniform density and lack of solid post-detonation species that complicate the determination of equation of state and further calculations. Nitromethane exhaust Exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes nitromethane will contain nitric acid vapour, which is corrosive, and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe. The condensed nitric acid-based residue left over in a glow-fueled model engine after a model-flight session can also corrode their internal components, usually mandating use of a combination of kerosene to neutralize the residual nitric acid, and an \\"after-run oil\\" (often the lower-viscosity \\"air tool oil\\" variety of a popular preservative oil) for lubrication to safeguard against such damage, when such an engine is placed into storage. Purification Nitromethane is a popular solvent in organic and electroanalytical chemistry. It can be purified by cooling below its freezing point, washing the solid with cold diethyl ether, followed by distillation.

In mathematics, a real-valued function defined on an n-dimensional interval is called convex if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph between the two points. Equivalently, a function is convex if its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. A twice-differentiable function of a single variable is convex if and only if its second derivative is nonnegative on its entire domain. Well-known examples of convex functions of a single variable include the squaring function x^2 and the exponential function e^x. In simple terms, a convex function refers to a function that is in the shape of a cup \\\\cup, and a concave function is in the shape of a cap \\\\cap. Convex functions play an important role in many areas of mathematics. They are especially important in the study of optimization problems where they are distinguished by a number of convenient properties. For instance, a strictly convex function on an open set has no more than one minimum. Even in infinite-dimensional spaces, under suitable additional hypotheses, convex functions continue to satisfy such properties and as a result, they are the most well-understood functionals in the calculus of variations. In probability theory, a convex function applied to the expected value of a random variable is always bounded above by the expected value of the convex function of the random variable. This result, known as Jensen's inequality, can be used to deduce inequalities such as the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and H√∂lder's inequality. Convex down & Convex up In introductory level math books, the term convex is often conflated with the opposite term concave by referring to a \\"concave function\\" as \\"convex downward\\". Likewise, a \\"concave\\" function is referred to as \\"convex upwards\\" to distinguish it from \\"convex downwards\\". However, the use of \\"up\\" and \\"down\\" keyword modifiers is not universally used in the field of mathematics, and mostly exists to avoid confusing students with an extra term for concavity. If the term \\"convex\\" is used without an \\"up\\" or \\"down\\" keyword, then it refers strictly to a cup shaped graph \\\\cup. (Example, Jensen's inequality refers to an inequality involving a convex function, and makes no mention of the words \\"convex up\\" or \\"convex down\\".) Definition Let X be a convex set in a real vector space and let f: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} be a function. * f is called convex if: ::\\\\forall x_1, x_2 \\\\in X, \\\\forall t \\\\in [0, 1]: \\\\qquad f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2)\\\\leq t f(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2) * f is called strictly convex if: ::\\\\forall x_1 eq x_2 \\\\in X, \\\\forall t \\\\in (0, 1): \\\\qquad f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2) < t f(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2) *A function f is said to be (strictly) concave if -f is (strictly) convex.  Properties  Many properties of convex functions have the same simple formulation for functions of many variable as for functions of one variable. See below the properties for the case of many variables, as some of them are not listed for functions of one variable. =Functions of one variable= * Suppose f is a function of one real variable defined on an interval, and let :: R(x_1,x_2) = \\\\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} :(note that is the slope of the purple line in the above drawing; the function R is symmetric in (x1, x2)). f is convex if and only if is monotonically non-decreasing in x1, for every fixed x2 (or vice versa). This characterization of convexity is quite useful to prove the following results. * A convex function f of one real variable defined on some open interval is continuous on . f admits left and right derivatives, and these are monotonically non-decreasing. As a consequence, f is differentiable at all but at most countably many points, the set on which f is not differentiable can however still be dense. If is closed, then f may fail to be continuous at the endpoints of (an example is shown in the examples section). * A differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its derivative is monotonically non-decreasing on that interval. If a function is differentiable and convex then it is also continuously differentiable. * A differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its graph lies above all of its tangents: ::f(x) \\\\geq f(y) + f'(y)(x-y) :for all x and y in the interval. * A twice differentiable function of one variable is convex on an interval if and only if its second derivative is non-negative there; this gives a practical test for convexity. Visually, a twice differentiable convex function \\"curves up\\", without any bends the other way (inflection points). If its second derivative is positive at all points then the function is strictly convex, but the converse does not hold. For example, the second derivative of f(x) = x4 is f ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤(x) = 12x2, which is zero for x = 0, but x4 is strictly convex. * If f is a convex function of one real variable, and f(0)\\\\le 0, then f is superadditive on the positive reals. ::Proof. Since f is convex, letting y = 0 we have :::f(tx) = f(tx+(1-t)\\\\cdot 0) \\\\le t f(x)+(1-t)f(0) \\\\le t f(x), \\\\quad \\\\forall t \\\\in[0,1] ::From this we have: :::f(a) + f(b) = f \\\\left((a+b) \\\\frac{a}{a+b} \\\\right) + f \\\\left((a+b) \\\\frac{b}{a+b} \\\\right) \\\\le \\\\frac{a}{a+b} f(a+b) + \\\\frac{b}{a+b} f(a+b) = f(a+b) *A function is midpoint convex on an interval if f(x) \\\\geq f(y) + f'(y)(x-y) :: \\\\forall x_1, x_2 \\\\in C: \\\\qquad f\\\\left( \\\\frac{x_1+x_2}{2} \\\\right) \\\\le \\\\frac{f(x_1)+f(x_2)}{2} :This condition is only slightly weaker than convexity. For example, a real-valued Lebesgue measurable function that is midpoint-convex is convex: this is a theorem of Sierpinski. In particular, a continuous function that is midpoint convex will be convex. =Functions of several variables= * A function f is convex if and only if its epigraph \\\\\\\\{ (x, \\\\mu) \\\\, : \\\\, \\\\mu \\\\ge f(x) \\\\\\\\} is a convex set. * A differentiable function f defined on a convex domain is convex if and only if f(x) \\\\geq f(y) + abla f(y)\\\\cdot (x-y) holds for all x, y in the domain. * A twice differentiable function of several variables is convex on a convex set if and only if its Hessian matrix of second partial derivatives is positive semidefinite on the interior of the convex set. * For a convex function f, the sublevel sets {x  f(x) < a} and {x  f(x) ‚â§ a} with are convex sets. A function that satisfies this property is called a quasiconvex function and may fail to be a convex function. * Consequently, the set of global minimisers of a convex function f is a convex set: {\\\\operatorname{argmin}}\\\\,f \\\\- convex. * Any local minimum of a convex function is also a global minimum. A strictly convex function will have at most one global minimum. * Jensen's inequality applies to every convex function f. If X is a random variable taking values in the domain of f, then \\\\operatorname{E}(f(X)) \\\\ge f(\\\\operatorname{E}(X)), where denotes the mathematical expectation. * A first-order homogeneous function of two positive variables x and y (i.e. f(ax, ay) = a f(x,y) for each a,x,y > 0) that is convex in one variable must be convex in the other variable.Altenberg, L., 2012. Resolvent positive linear operators exhibit the reduction phenomenon. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 109(10), pp.3705-3710. Operations that preserve convexity *-f is concave if and only if f is convex. *Nonnegative weighted sums: **if w_1, \\\\ldots, w_n \\\\ge 0 and f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n are all convex, then so is w_1 f_1 + \\\\cdots + w_n f_n. In particular, the sum of two convex functions is convex. **this property extends to infinite sums, integrals and expected values as well (provided that they exist). *Elementwise maximum: let \\\\\\\\{f_i\\\\\\\\}_{i \\\\in I} be a collection of convex functions. Then g(x) = \\\\sup_{i \\\\in I} f_i(x) is convex. The domain of g(x) is the collection of points where the expression is finite. Important special cases: **If f_1, \\\\ldots, f_n are convex functions then so is g(x) = \\\\max \\\\\\\\{f_1(x), \\\\ldots, f_n(x)\\\\\\\\} **If f(x,y) is convex in then g(x) = \\\\sup olimits_{y\\\\in C} f(x,y) is convex in x even if C is not a convex set. *Composition: **If and are convex functions and is non-decreasing over a univariate domain, then h(x) = g(f(x)) is convex. As an example, if f is convex, then so is e^{f(x)}. because e^x is convex and monotonically increasing. **If is concave and is convex and non-increasing over a univariate domain, then h(x) = g(f(x)) is convex. **Convexity is invariant under affine maps: that is, if is convex with domain D_f \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R}^m, then so is g(x) = f(Ax+b), where A \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^{m \\\\times n}\\\\text{, } b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^m with domain D_g \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbf{R}^n. *Minimization: If f(x,y) is convex in (x,y) then g(x) = \\\\inf olimits_{y\\\\in C} f(x,y) is convex in x, provided that C is a convex set and that g(x) eq -\\\\infty *If f is convex, then its perspective g(x, t) = t f \\\\left (\\\\tfrac{x}{t} \\\\right ) with domain \\\\left\\\\lbrace (x, t) \\\\mid \\\\tfrac x t \\\\in \\\\operatorname{Dom}(f), t > 0 \\\\right \\\\rbrace is convex. Strongly convex functions The concept of strong convexity extends and parametrizes the notion of strict convexity. A strongly convex function is also strictly convex, but not vice versa. A differentiable function f is called strongly convex with parameter if the following inequality holds for all points in its domain: :( abla f(x) - abla f(y) )^T (x-y) \\\\ge m \\\\x-y\\\\_2^2 or, more generally, : \\\\langle abla f(x) - abla f(y), x-y \\\\rangle \\\\ge m \\\\x-y\\\\^2 where \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\ is any norm. Some authors, such as refer to functions satisfying this inequality as elliptic functions. An equivalent condition is the following: : f(y) \\\\ge f(x) + abla f(x)^T (y-x) + \\\\frac{m}{2} \\\\y-x\\\\_2^2 It is not necessary for a function to be differentiable in order to be strongly convex. A third definition for a strongly convex function, with parameter m, is that, for all x, y in the domain and t\\\\in [0,1], :f(tx+(1-t)y) \\\\le t f(x)+(1-t)f(y) - \\\\frac{1}{2} m t(1-t) \\\\x-y\\\\_2^2 Notice that this definition approaches the definition for strict convexity as m ‚Üí 0, and is identical to the definition of a convex function when m = 0. Despite this, functions exist that are strictly convex but are not strongly convex for any m > 0 (see example below). If the function f is twice continuously differentiable, then it is strongly convex with parameter m if and only if abla^2 f(x) \\\\succeq mI for all x in the domain, where I is the identity and abla^2f is the Hessian matrix, and the inequality \\\\succeq means that abla^2 f(x) - mI is positive semi-definite. This is equivalent to requiring that the minimum eigenvalue of abla^2 f(x) be at least m for all x. If the domain is just the real line, then abla^2 f(x) is just the second derivative f(x), so the condition becomes f(x) \\\\ge m. If m = 0, then this means the Hessian is positive semidefinite (or if the domain is the real line, it means that f(x) \\\\ge 0), which implies the function is convex, and perhaps strictly convex, but not strongly convex. Assuming still that the function is twice continuously differentiable, one can show that the lower bound of abla^2 f(x) implies that it is strongly convex. Using Taylor's Theorem there exists : z \\\\in \\\\\\\\{ t x + (1-t) y : t \\\\in [0,1] \\\\\\\\} such that : f(y) = f(x) + abla f(x)^T (y-x) + \\\\frac{1}{2} (y-x)^T abla^2f(z) (y-x) Then :(y-x)^T abla^2f(z) (y-x) \\\\ge m (y-x)^T(y-x) by the assumption about the eigenvalues, and hence we recover the second strong convexity equation above. A function f is strongly convex with parameter m if and only if the function :x\\\\mapsto f(x) -\\\\frac m 2 \\\\x\\\\^2 is convex. The distinction between convex, strictly convex, and strongly convex can be subtle at first glance. If f is twice continuously differentiable and the domain is the real line, then we can characterize it as follows: : f convex if and only if f(x) \\\\ge 0 for all . : f strictly convex if f(x) > 0 for all (note: this is sufficient, but not necessary). : f strongly convex if and only if f(x) \\\\ge m > 0 for all . For example, let f be strictly convex, and suppose there is a sequence of points (x_n) such that f(x_n) = \\\\tfrac{1}{n}. Even though f(x_n) > 0, the function is not strongly convex because f(x) will become arbitrarily small. A twice continuously differentiable function f on a compact domain X that satisfies f(x)>0 for all x\\\\in X is strongly convex. The proof of this statement follows from the extreme value theorem, which states that a continuous function on a compact set has a maximum and minimum. Strongly convex functions are in general easier to work with than convex or strictly convex functions, since they are a smaller class. Like strictly convex functions, strongly convex functions have unique minima on compact sets. =Uniformly convex functions= A uniformly convex function, with modulus \\\\phi, is a function f that, for all x, y in the domain and , satisfies :f(tx+(1-t)y) \\\\le t f(x)+(1-t)f(y) - t(1-t) \\\\phi(\\\\x-y\\\\) where \\\\phi is a function that is non-negative and vanishes only at 0\\\\. This is a generalization of the concept of strongly convex function; by taking \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) = \\\\tfrac{m}{2} \\\\alpha^2 we recover the definition of strong convexity. Examples =Functions of one variable= * The function f(x)=x^2 has f(x)=2>0, so is a convex function. It is also strongly convex (and hence strictly convex too), with strong convexity constant 2. * The function f(x)=x^4 has f(x)=12x^2\\\\ge 0, so is a convex function. It is strictly convex, even though the second derivative is not strictly positive at all points. It is not strongly convex. * The absolute value function f(x)=x is convex (as reflected in the triangle inequality), even though it does not have a derivative at the point x = 0\\\\. It is not strictly convex. * The function f(x)=x^p for p \\\\ge 1 is convex. * The exponential function f(x)=e^x is convex. It is also strictly convex, since f(x)=e^x >0 , but it is not strongly convex since the second derivative can be arbitrarily close to zero. More generally, the function g(x) = e^{f(x)} is logarithmically convex if is a convex function. The term \\"superconvex\\" is sometimes used instead. * The function f with domain [0,1] defined by f(0)=f(1)=1, f(x)=0 for 0 < x< 1 is convex; it is continuous on the open interval (0, 1), but not continuous at 0 and 1\\\\. * The function x3 has second derivative 6x; thus it is convex on the set where x ‚â• 0 and concave on the set where x ‚â§ 0\\\\. * Examples of functions that are monotonically increasing but not convex include f(x)=\\\\sqrt{x} and g(x)=\\\\log x. * Examples of functions that are convex but not monotonically increasing include h(x)= x^2 and k(x)=-x. * The function f(x) = \\\\tfrac{1}{x} has f(x)=\\\\tfrac{2}{x^3} which is greater than 0 if x > 0, so f(x) is convex on the interval (0, \\\\infty). It is concave on the interval (-\\\\infty, 0). * The function f(x)=\\\\tfrac{1}{x^2} with f(0)=\\\\infty, is convex on the interval (0, \\\\infty) and convex on the interval (-\\\\infty, 0), but not convex on the interval (-\\\\infty, \\\\infty), because of the singularity at x = 0\\\\. =Functions of n variables= * LogSumExp function, also called softmax function, is a convex function. *The function -\\\\log\\\\det(X) on the domain of positive-definite matrices is convex. * Every real-valued linear transformation is convex but not strictly convex, since if is linear, then f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b). This statement also holds if we replace \\"convex\\" by \\"concave\\". * Every real-valued affine function, i.e., each function of the form f(x) = a^T x + b, is simultaneously convex and concave. * Every norm is a convex function, by the triangle inequality and positive homogeneity. * The spectral radius of a nonnegative matrix is a convex function of its diagonal elements.Cohen, J.E., 1981.

He was chief executioner at 41 executions and acted as assistant executioner at 53 others, at various prisons in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and Cyprus. He acted as assistant executioner for 14 years, mostly to Albert Pierrepoint from 1941 to 1955. In October 1955 Allen was appointed as Chief Executioner alongside Pierrepoint, although he did not execute anyone in this role until 10 May 1956, when he hanged two EOKA members in Cyprus. Pierrepoint was no longer available because he had resigned in February 1956. Allen's most controversial hanging came in April 1962, when James Hanratty was hanged for murder, despite efforts to clear his name. Hanratty was proven guilty in 2002 by DNA. Allen also assisted in the execution of Derek Bentley in 1953, and he performed one of the last two executions in Britain, in August 1964. Early life Born in Denaby Main, near Conisbrough in the West Riding of Yorkshire on 5 November 1911, Allen was brought up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, and was educated at St Anne's Roman Catholic School in Burlington Street, Ashton. His first job was in the Transport Department at Park Bridge Iron Works, before he became a bus driver with Ashton Corporation, a job he continued to hold after he became an assistant hangman in 1941. Career as an executioner Allen applied for a job in the Prison Service in the 1930s but was turned down. He successfully applied to be put on the Home Office list of executioners and was often employed as an assistant executioner to Tom Pierrepoint, the uncle of Albert Pierrepoint. As a preliminary step, he witnessed his first execution at the age of 29 ‚Äì that of William Cooper ‚Äì on 26 November 1940 at Bedford Prison, describing it as a \\"very good, clean job, not as gruesome as I expected\\". Allen became a publican in Farnworth, Lancashire in the 1940s, combining his role as executioner with running the pub, which he ran until the early 1950s when he took over another pub, the Junction Inn, on Higher Lane in Whitefield. In 1945, five German prisoners of war were hanged for murdering a fellow German soldier, Sergeant-Major Wolfgang Rosterg, whom they suspected of having betrayed their escape plan. It seems to have been this crime and ultimate execution that made the deepest impression on Allen. He wrote, \\"It was a foul murder. They staged a mock trial, kicking the victim to death and dragging him by the neck to the toilet where they hung his lifeless body on a waste pipe. These five prisoners are the most callous men I have ever met so far but I blame the Nazi doctrine for that. It must be a terrible creed.\\" A 21-year-old, Erich Palme-K√∂nig, was the first of the soldiers to be hanged at Pentonville Prison, swearing allegiance to the last to Nazi Germany. On 28 January 1953 Allen assisted at the controversial execution of Derek Bentley, who was hanged for a murder committed by a friend and accomplice during an attempted robbery, and for which Bentley received a posthumous pardon 45 years later. Contrary to some accounts Allen was not present at the execution of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in the UK, in 1955: the assistant to Albert Pierrepoint on that occasion was Royston Rickard. Following the resignation of Albert Pierrepoint and the death of Stephen Wade in 1956, Allen and Robert Leslie Stewart jointly became Chief Executioners. However, the Homicide Act 1957 reduced the number of condemned criminals by 75%, from an average of 15 a year in the early 1950s to about four a year in the late 1950s. As Chief Executioner, on 11 July 1958 Allen hanged American-born Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel at Barlinnie prison, Glasgow. He also hanged Guenther Podola on 5 November 1959, a German-born petty thief, and the last man to be hanged in the UK for killing a police officer. His most controversial case was that of James Hanratty, hanged on 4 April 1962 at Bedford Prison for the \\"A6 murder\\" case. Efforts to clear Hanratty's name continued until 2001, when DNA testing matched Hanratty to the crime scene. Some newspapers claim that Allen's son Brian assisted his father at five hangings, a claim which is rejected by Allen's biographer Stewart McLaughlin. In Charles Duff's book A Handbook on Hanging, an article in the Daily Sketch (26 May 1960) quotes Brian as saying that he had quit as assistant hangman because his fianc√© would not marry him \\"unless you stop helping to hang people\\". Brian Allen said \\"I'd been in two minds about quitting the job, but when Angela asked me to drop it, that decided me ... Of course, Dad and I don't talk about the hangman's job. I know it is supposed to run in families, but I've decided it is \\"out\\" for me ‚Äì though someone has to do it\\". However, a report in The Spokesman Review (8 May 1961) headlined \\"Hangman Quits To Save Lives\\" stated that he had quit because of a \\"conflict of loyalties\\" ‚Äì he had recently qualified as a mental health nurse and had taken a vow to \\"do all in my power to save and preserve life\\". Allen performed the last execution in Northern Ireland in December 1961, when he hanged Robert McGladdery at Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast. He also performed the last hanging in Scotland, when Henry Burnett was hanged at Craiginches Prison in Aberdeen on 15 August 1963 for the murder of Thomas Guyan. He hanged Russell Pascoe, one of the third-last prisoners to be hanged in a British prison , at Bristol's Horfield Prison on 17 December in the same year. He also performed one of the two final executions in the UK, when at 8.00 am on 13 August 1964 Gwynne Owen Evans was hanged at Strangeways Prison in Manchester for the murder of John Alan West. This occurred simultaneously with the execution of Evans's accomplice Peter Anthony Allen, who was hanged at Walton Gaol in Liverpool by Robert Leslie Stewart. Allen always wore a bow tie during executions as a sign of respect. Of his job, Allen said, \\"I never felt a moment's remorse and always slept peacefully on the nights before and after a hanging.\\" A second man also answering to the name \\"Harry Allen\\", Herbert Allen, an ice cream salesman from the West Midlands, was also on the official list of executioners for a period in the early 1950s, having graduated from the same training group as Syd Dernley. The two Harry Allens are known to have worked together as assistants on at least two double hangings.Dernley & Newman The Hangman's Tale: Memoirs of a Public Executioner, Trans-Atlantic Publications, 1990 Both Harry Allens, particularly the Birmingham one, feature prominently throughout the book.

In addition to these, Allen also performed the 9 executions of EOKA members which took place at the Central Jail of Nicosia, Cyprus in 1956 and 1957. The remains of the hanged men are buried within the walls of the prison, in the \\"Imprisoned Graves\\" section. Their names are: *Michalis KaraolisCYPRUS: Deepening Tragedy, Time Magazine, Monday, 21 May. 1956. ‚Äì executed 10 May 1956 *Andreas Dimitriou ‚Äì executed 10 May 1956 *Iakovos Patatsos ‚Äì executed 9 August 1956 *Andreas Zakos ‚Äì executed 9 August 1956 *Harilaos Michael ‚Äì executed 9 August 1956 *Michael Koutsoftas ‚Äì executed 21 September 1956 *Stelios Mavrommatis ‚Äì executed 21 September 1956 *Andreas Panagidis ‚Äì executed 21 September 1956 *Evagoras Pallikaridis ‚Äì executed 14 March 1957 Following the Independence of Cyprus in 1960, Allen performed the final three executions at the Central Jail of Nicosia for the new Cypriot government, assisted by John Underhill. All 3 executions took place on 13 June 1962: *Hambis Zacharia ‚Äì killed a man in a Limassol vineyard in 1958 *Michael Hiletikos ‚Äì shot a man dead outside a Limassol nightclub in 1961. Fled to UK and was extradited to Cyprus to stand trial *Lazaris Demetriou ‚Äì shot a man dead outside a Limassol nightclub in 1961. The accomplice of Michael Hiletikos Personal life and diaries Allen's first wife was Marjorie Clayton whom he married in 1933. She left him on the day that he was hanging Peter Manuel. Allen's second wife was Doris Dyke, whom he married in 1963. In October 2008 it was revealed that Allen had kept a diary which included a precise log of the prisoners and how they died. He recorded each prisoner's age, weight, height and calculations for the length of rope needed to hang them. The diary and other belongings were sold at auction in Knutsford, Cheshire on behalf of his widow in November 2008 for ¬£17,200. Allen always publicly maintained that hanging was a \\"swift and humane business\\". In his diaries he revealed that the execution of one prisoner, Peter Griffiths, who was convicted at Lancaster assizes of murdering a three-year-old child, June Anne Devaney, in the grounds of Queens Park Hospital in Blackburn on 15 May 1948, took 30 seconds, which would have been the time from Allen's entering the condemned cell to the moment of the drop. Many other executions were faster than this, but death itself was always practically instantaneous. Griffiths was 22 years old, 5' 10\\" tall, weighed 10st 8lbs, and was given a drop of 7 feet 6 inches on 15 November 1948 at Walton Gaol. Of another hanging he noted, \\"Very good job, but should have had another two or three inches ‚Äì very strong.\\" His granddaughter Fiona Allen is a comedian and actress, who rose to fame on the comedy sketch show Smack the Pony. She said of him, \\"It's as if I had two grandfathers. One was the sweet, lovely man who took me for walks on the beach, bought me sweets and toys and always had me laughing and giggling. The other one was the man employed to take lives for the Government. When I was a kid, everyone in the area knew what he did. I remember going round to my first boyfriend's house for the first time and I tried to impress his dad by telling him I wanted to go on the stage. He looked up from his paper and said, 'Going on the stage are you, lass? Well keep away from the trapdoor!. Later life Under the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, capital punishment in the UK for murder was suspended, before finally being abolished in 1969 (It was abolished in 1973 in Northern Ireland). Although the death penalty remained for other crimes such as treason and piracy with violence, no further executions took place in the UK, although a working gallows was kept in service and regularly tested at Wandsworth Prison until 1998. It was dismantled when the death penalty for treason and piracy was abolished by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Allen moved to Fleetwood with his wife Doris in 1977, to escape the continued publicity, and worked there as a cashier at Fleetwood Pier. He died on 14 August 1992, just a month after Albert Pierrepoint, who had died on 10 July in Southport.

It may also refer to the movement of information from its source to the general public, often (but not always) via the media. The subjects of publicity include people of public interest, goods and services, organizations, and works of art or entertainment. A publicist is someone that carries out publicity, while public relations (PR) is the strategic management function that helps an organization establish and maintain communication with the public. This can be done internally, without the use of popular media. From a marketing perspective, publicity is one component of promotion and marketing. The other elements of the promotional mix are advertising, sales promotion, direct marketing and personal selling. Organizations will sometimes organize events designed to attract media coverage, and subsequently, provide positive publicity; these events are known as publicity stunts. History French advertising poster \\"Maggi Arome Pour Corser\\" by Firmin Bouisset, circa 1895. Publicity originates from the French word publicit√©. Publicity as a practice originates in the core of Paris, where shopping, tourism and the entertainment industry met commercialised print media and a burgeoning publishing industry. Among the urban society, scenes of consumption and new consumer identities were circulated through advertisement. La Maison Aubert shaped the emerging discipline of publicity. In early 19th century Paris, the advertisements and publicity campaigns for consumer items, such as cashmere shawls, and retailers such as perfumeries soon attracted regulation on flyposting. 19th century US companies included not only pro-sales messages in their publicity, but also explanations, demonstrations and exaggerations. Patent medicine and cosmetics manufacturers in the US frequently described or even showed consumers before and after the usage of the product. The Blair Manufacturing Company was among the US companies that advertised its products by comparing old-fashioned consumers who did not use the advertised product with the progressive customers who did. Before-after-changes became common in advertisement from 1910 onwards. The contemporary economist Thorstein Veblen criticised the relative benefit of publicity. He argued that vendibility is not utility, and that publicity had \\"no traceable relation to any benefit which the community may derive.\\" Veblen estimated how much the publicity campaigns of companies added to the price consumers were paying. He argued that the publicity overhead for over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and cosmetics was more than half the retail price. Public relations Publicity is often referred to as the result of public relations, in terms of providing favourable information to media and any third party outlets; these may including bloggers, mainstream media, as well as new media forms such as podcasts. This is done to provide a message to consumers without having to pay for direct time or space. This in return creates awareness and achieves greater credibility. After the message has been distributed, the publicist in charge of the information will lose control of how the message is used and interpreted, in contrast to the way it works in advertising.Mersham, G., Theunissen, P., & Peart, J. (2016). Public Relations and Communication Management: An Aotearoa/New Zealand Perspective. Auckland: Pearson. According to Grunig, public relations is often reduced to publicity. He also states how publicity is a form of activity in which should be associated with the sales promotion effort of a company, in order to help aid advertising and personal salesmanship as well.Grunig, J. (1992). Excellence in public relations and communication management (pp. 263, 386). Hillsdale, N.J.: L. Erlbaum Associates. Kent also stated that the doing of publicity can help attract attention whilst also supplying information regarding a specific organization or individual client and any event, activity or attribute associated with them.Kent, M. (2011). Public Relations Writing (p. 15). Boston, Mass.: Allyn & Bacon. A coffeehouse in 17th century London. The use of publicity is also known to be an important strategic element and promotional tool due to its effect of intentional exposure on a consumer. This helps publicity gain an advantage over other forms of marketing, such as advertising, often in order to boost credibility. Favourable publicity is also created through reputation management, in which organizations try strive to control via the web. Furthermore, despite the fact that publicity, both good or bad, can be beneficial for an organization, company or individual, much of it is paid for despite claims that publicity is often free. Despite publicity being an influential benefit within the marketing sector, one disadvantage which highly affects publicity is the lack of ability in which publicity cannot be repeated, in comparison to paid advertising. Publicists A publicist is a person whose job is to generate and manage publicity for a company, product, public figure (especially a celebrity), or work such as a book, movie, or band. Though there are many aspects to a publicist's job, their main function is to persuade the news media to report about their client in the most positive way possible. Publicists identify newsworthy aspects of products and personalities to offer to media outlets as possible reportage ideas. A variant of this practice which relies on linking a brand to a breaking news story has been dubbed \\"newsjacking\\". Publicists are also responsible for shaping reportage about their clients in a timely manner that fits within a media outlet's news cycle. They attempt to present a newsworthy story in a way that influences editorial coverage in a certain, usually positive, direction. This is what is generally referred to as spin. A publicist generally serves as a bridge between a client and the public. Although day-to-day duties vary depending on what each clients needs consist of, the main focal point for a publicist is promotion. With regard to a crisis situation, publicists often attempt to use the situation as an opportunity to get their organization's or client's name into the media. A press agent, or flack, is a professional publicist who acts on behalf of his or her client on all matters involving public relations. Press agents are typically employed by public personalities and organizations such as performers and businesses. A press agent will provide information to the media such as upcoming public events, interview opportunities, and promotional dates, and will work with the media in getting in touch with an appropriate client or resource. Press agents are occasionally required to act as \\"spin doctors, to put into the best light their clients' public actions. While press agents have traditionally worked with newspapers and television, they may also be conversant with newer media forms such as blogs and podcasts. Professor Elizabeth L. Toth describes how press agents are willing to intrigue mainstream media and web blogs with ‚Äúbad news‚Äù (celebrity drug addictions, divorces, scandals, sordid affairs etc.) in order to ‚Äúsell‚Äù a story and help gain further coverage for their clients. This is supported by the press agentry/publicity model which is often used within the fashion, sporting, and entertainment industries, following the presumption that even bad news can be good publicity.  Negative publicity  Press photographers in Hong Kong. Publicity can also create a negative effect for those being publicized. One of the most important factors in relation to influencing a consumer's buying decision is how a company, brand, or individual deals with negative publicity. Negative publicity may result in major loss of revenue or market shares within a business. It can also play a part in damaging a consumer's perception of a brand or its products. Negative publicity's high credibility and greater influence compared to other company-controlled communications play a part in the potential damage it may have on a corporate image. Crises involved with an organization may also result in negative publicity. Furthermore, negative publicity affects everything from the evaluation of a brand and product to the present. Often, when awareness of a company, brand, or individual is high, negative publicity is deemed to hurt possible sales. In contrast, companies, brands, and individuals who are not widely known may use the negative publicity in order to increase brand awareness among the public. The extensive range of media outlets, including both traditional and new media, provide opportunities for companies to market their products or services. This, however, restricts or reduces the ability to manage negative publicity, as their message may be spread across media outlets. In order for organizations to try salvage any negative publicity surrounding their brand, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one solution which can help protect the image of a company or help reverse the damage. Companies must adopt the CSR approach early for it to be effective, or potential risks such as falsified intentions may develop within a consumer's perception. Despite the damaging effect negative publicity may cause, negative publicity may not always have the expected effect. There is a possibility that negative publicity may in fact gain more attention as opposed to positive publicity. Regardless of the nature of negative publicity and its ability to turn most people away, any slight hint of negative publicity can in fact build interest amongst the consumer. As states by Monga & John, negative publicity is not always harmful, and consumers whom identify a brand with strong attitudes are highly unlikely to be affected by the negative publicity formed.

Path taken by data to DSLAM # Customer premises: DSL modem terminating the ADSL, SHDSL or VDSL circuit and providing a LAN or interface to a single computer or LAN segment. # Local loop: the telephone company wires from a customer to the telephone exchange or to a serving area interface, often called the \\"last mile\\" (LM). # Telephone exchange: #* Main distribution frame (MDF): a wiring rack that connects outside subscriber lines with internal lines. It is used to connect public or private lines coming into the building to internal networks. At the telco, the MDF is generally in proximity to the cable vault and not far from the telephone switch. #* xDSL filters: DSL filters are used in the telephone exchange to split voice from data signals. The voice signal can be routed to a plain old telephone service (POTS) provider or left unused whilst the data signal is routed to the ISP DSLAM via the HDF (see next entry). #* Handover distribution frame (HDF): a distribution frame that connects the last mile provider with the service provider's DSLAM #* DSLAM: a device for DSL service. The DSLAM port where the subscriber local loop is connected converts analog electrical signals to data traffic (upstream traffic for data upload) and data traffic to analog electrical signals (downstream for data download). Role of the DSLAM xDSL Connectivity diagram The DSLAM equipment collects the data from its many modem ports and aggregates their voice and data traffic into one complex composite \\"signal\\" via multiplexing. Depending on its device architecture and setup, a DSLAM aggregates the DSL lines over its Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), frame relay, and/or Internet Protocol network, i.e., an IP-DSLAM using Packet Transfer Mode - Transmission Convergence (PTM-TC) protocol(s) stack. The aggregated traffic is then directed to a telco's backbone switch, via an access network (AN), also called a Network Service Provider (NSP), at up to 10 Gbit/s data rates. The DSLAM acts like a network switch since its functionality is at Layer 2 of the OSI model. Therefore, it cannot re-route traffic between multiple IP networks, only between ISP devices and end-user connection points. The DSLAM traffic is switched to a Broadband Remote Access Server where the end-user traffic is then routed across the ISP network to the Internet. Customer-premises equipment that interfaces well with the DSLAM to which it is connected may take advantage of enhanced telephone voice and data line signaling features and the bandwidth monitoring and compensation capabilities it supports. A DSLAM may or may not be located in the telephone exchange, and may also serve multiple data and voice customers within a neighborhood serving area interface, sometimes in conjunction with a digital loop carrier. DSLAMs are also used by hotels, lodges, residential neighborhoods, and other businesses operating their own private telephone exchange. In addition to being a data switch and multiplexer, a DSLAM is also a large collection of modems. Each modem on the aggregation card communicates with a single subscriber's DSL modem. This modem functionality is integrated into the DSLAM itself instead of being done via an external device like a 20th-century voiceband modem. Like traditional voice-band modems, a DSLAM's integrated DSL modems are usually able to probe the line and to adjust themselves to electronically or digitally compensate for forward echoes and other bandwidth-limiting factors in order to move data at the maximum possible connection rate. This compensation capability also takes advantage of the better performance of \\"balanced line\\" DSL connections, providing capabilities for LAN segments longer than physically similar unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Ethernet connections, since the balanced line type is generally required for its hardware to function correctly. This is due to the nominal line impedance (measured in Ohms but comprising both resistance and inductance) of balanced lines being somewhat lower than that of UTP, thus supporting 'weaker' signals (however the solid-state electronics required to construct such digital interfaces are more costly). Bandwidth versus distance Balanced pair cable has higher attenuation at higher frequencies. Therefore, the longer the wire between DSLAM and subscriber, the slower the maximum possible data rate due to the lower frequencies being used to limit the total attenuation (or due to the higher number of errors at higher frequencies, effectively lowering the overall frequency/data rate). The following is a rough guide to the relation between wire distance (based on 0.40 mm copper and ADSL2+ technology) and maximum data rate. Local conditions may vary, especially beyond 2 km, often necessitating a closer DSLAM to bring acceptable bandwidths: * 25 Mbit/s at 1,000 feet (~300 m) * 24 Mbit/s at 2,000 feet (~600 m) * 23 Mbit/s at 3,000 feet (~900 m) * 22 Mbit/s at 4,000 feet (~1.2 km) * 21 Mbit/s at 5,000 feet (~1.5 km) * 19 Mbit/s at 6,000 feet (~1.8 km) * 16 Mbit/s at 7,000 feet (~2.1 km) * 8 Mbit/s at 10,000 feet (~3 km) * 3 Mbit/s at 15,000 feet (4.5 km) * 1.5 Mbit/s at 17,000 feet (~5.2 km) Hardware details Customers connect to the DSLAM through ADSL modems or DSL routers, which are connected to the PSTN network via typical unshielded twisted pair telephone lines. Each DSLAM has multiple aggregation cards, and each such card can have multiple ports to which the customers' lines are connected. Typically a single DSLAM aggregation card has 24 ports, but this number can vary with each manufacturer. The most common DSLAMs are housed in a telco-grade chassis, which are supplied with (nominal) 48 volts DC. Hence a typical DSLAM setup may contain power converters, DSLAM chassis, aggregation cards, cabling, and upstream links. On the upstream trunk (ISP) side many early DSLAMs used ATM‚Äîand this approach was standardized by the DSL Forum‚Äîwith Gigabit Ethernet support appearing sometime later. Today, the most common upstream links in these DSLAMs use Gigabit Ethernet or multi-gigabit fiber optic links. IP-DSLAM IP-DSLAM stands for Internet Protocol Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer. User traffic is mostly IP based. Traditional 20th century DSLAMs used Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) technology to connect to upstream ATM routers/switches. These devices then extract the IP traffic and pass it on to an IP router in an IP network. This division of work was thought to be sensible because DSL itself is based on ATM, and could theoretically carry data other than IP in that ATM stream. In contrast, an IP-DSLAM extracts the IP traffic in the DSLAM itself and passes it on to an IP router. The advantages of IP-DSLAM over a traditional ATM DSLAM are that the merged equipment is less expensive to make and operate and can offer a richer set of features.

A protoplanet is a large planetary embryo that originated within a protoplanetary disc and has undergone internal melting to produce a differentiated interior. Protoplanets are thought to form out of kilometer- sized planetesimals that gravitationally perturb each other's orbits and collide, gradually coalescing into the dominant planets. In the case of the Solar System, it is thought that the collisions of planetesimals created a few hundred planetary embryos. Such embryos were similar to Ceres and Pluto with masses of about 1022 to 1023 kg and were a few thousand kilometers in diameter. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, they collided with one another. The exact sequence whereby planetary embryos collided to assemble the planets is not known, but it is thought that initial collisions would have replaced the first \\"generation\\" of embryos with a second generation consisting of fewer but larger embryos. These in their turn would have collided to create a third generation of fewer but even larger embryos. Eventually, only a handful of embryos were left, which collided to complete the assembly of the planets proper. Early protoplanets had more radioactive elements, the quantity of which has been reduced over time due to radioactive decay. Heating due to radioactivity, impact, and gravitational pressure melted parts of protoplanets as they grew toward being planets. In melted zones their heavier elements sank to the center, whereas lighter elements rose to the surface. Such a process is known as planetary differentiation. The composition of some meteorites show that differentiation took place in some asteroids. According to the giant impact hypothesis the Moon formed from a colossal impact of a hypothetical protoplanet called Theia with Earth, early in the Solar System's history. In the inner Solar System, the three protoplanets to survive more-or-less intact are the asteroids Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta. Psyche is likely the survivor of a violent hit-and-run with another object that stripped off the outer, rocky layers of a protoplanet. The asteroid Metis may also have a similar origin history to Psyche. The asteroid Lutetia also has characteristics that resemble a protoplanet. Kuiper-belt dwarf planets have also been referred to as protoplanets. Because iron meteorites have been found on Earth, it is deemed likely that there once were other metal-cored protoplanets in the asteroid belt that since have been disrupted and that are the source of these meteorites. In February 2013 astronomers made the first direct observation of a protoplanet forming in a disk of gas and dust around a distant star.

Astrosniks toys are highly collectible, especially the plastic figurines.  Anatomy and culture  A Snik is about 5 to 6 cm (2\\" to 2.5\\") high, and possesses enormous strength and intelligence. They have antennae (most have two, but Galaxo has only one) and prominent buckteeth. There is a notable racial diversity; although most Sniks have green skin (with yellow or orange hair), some are orange (with yellow hair), black (with silver hair), pink, or blue skin. A subspecies of Astrosniks, Marsmen Sniks (also known as Walkman Sniks), do not have any arms or visible noses. They too have a wide range of skin tones: blue, orange, red, yellow, green, black, and white. Sniks are frequently described as happy, lovable, and friendly. They are said to be eager to learn and \\"they always take time to play, to be funny, and to enjoy life and friendships\\". Sniks are called \\"friends of mankind\\", but the nature and extent of their interaction with humans has not been revealed. Astrosnik transportation includes dune buggies, rockets, and flying saucers. Their design has a retro-futuristic look. Backstory The Astrosniks have an ancient culture is said to have developed rapidly due to their communication system called \\"Sniknet\\", which is not to be confused with their language, \\"Sniklish\\". They possess space travel, as well time travel technology. The Sniks originate on the planetoid Snikeria, which is close in size to Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta. This means Snikeria is between 469 and 950 km in diameter. The planetoid is mobile, and powered by the mysterious \\"quasar-force\\". Millions of years ago, it was moved to the Sol System, where it settled into orbit behind Mars; it is permanently occulted by the planet and not visible from Earth. In time, Snikeria became overpopulated. So, many Sniks slowly immigrated to Mars, and developed a subterranean system of paths and supply lines. Besides a Head Office of administration, other important locations include store rooms and lecture halls. Toys Released as several sets of figurines in Germany in the 1970s, the Astrosniks were licensed to about 50 manufacturers to produce memorabilia in 1983 and 1984. One prominent outlet for Astrosnik figurines during this era was McDonald's, which issued the toys as a part of a long-running Happy Meal promotion. The toys were usually offered as consolation prizes on the game show Starcade. The Snik figurines were reissued in 1999.

Overview According to the project Application ManagerTOP3 smart moves Richard Cownie. Real World Technologies (September 2009) during the project, while Acorn was developing the kernel, it used C and Acorn Modula Execution Library (CAMEL) in Acorn Extended Modula-2 (AEM2) compiler (ported from Modula-2 ETH Zurich (ETH) using Econet hardware), though never released externally, CAMEL was ported to use it in Sun Microsystems Unix computer, in an effort to port Sun's workstations Sun NeWS to the Archimedes, and after Olivetti acquired Acorn, developed a compiler based on AEM2 for the programming language Modula-3. ARX was a preemptive multitasking, multithreading, multi-user operating system. Much of the OS ran in user mode and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into kernel mode to perform mutexes, which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARM3 version of the ARM processor. It had support of optical (write once read many (WORM)) disks file system and featured a window system, a window toolkit (and a direct manipulation user interface (UI) editor) and an Interscript-based text editor, for enriched documents written in Interpress (a HTML precursor). The OS had to be fitted in a 512 kibibyte (KB) read-only memory (ROM) ROM image. This suggests that ARX had a microkernel-type design. It was not finished in time to be used in the Acorn Archimedes range of computers, which shipped in 1987 with an operating system named Arthur, later renamed RISC OS, derived from the earlier Machine Operating System (MOS) from Acorn's earlier 8-bit BBC Micro range.

West was a 53-year-old van driver for a laundry when he was killed by Gwynne Evans and Peter Allen who had gone to rob him at his home in Seaton, Cumberland. Both murderers were unemployed and had a history of petty crime; they were arrested and charged within two days of the crime. At trial, each blamed the other, but the jury by its verdict found both responsible. Use of the death penalty had been declining and the decision not to reprieve the two came as a surprise; their death sentences were carried out on 13 August 1964, in prisons in Manchester and Liverpool. The death penalty was abolished 15 months later. Gwynne Evans Evans (left), Allen (right) Gwynne Owen Evans was born in Maryport, Cumberland, on 1 April 1940 with the name John Robson Walby, the third, and eldest surviving, child of Thomas and Hannah Walby. While attending a secondary modern school in Maryport, he occasionally attended Dovenby Hall Mental Colony in Cockermouth. On leaving school at 15 he worked as a page boy at a hotel in Carlisle and an engine cleaner for British Railways, in between periods of unemployment. He was given a supervision order in 1957 and sent to a hostel in Bristol; later that year he enlisted in the Border Regiment but was discharged in March 1958 as \\"unfit under existing standards\\". He enlisted again in the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in November 1958, being discharged in February 1959 for the same reason.Jones, pp. 113‚Äì114. At this point he took to using the name Owen Evans, and worked briefly for British Railways before again trying the armed forces. The Royal Air Force accepted him in July 1959, but discharged him after four months as \\"physically unfit for Air Force service\\". It was during a series of short-term jobs around Workington from September 1960 that Evans briefly worked for the Lakeland Laundry and came to know Jack West. He soon left and moved to Birmingham in October 1961 and there worked as a kitchen porter, driver and lift attendant.Jones, p. 114. On 5 April 1963 as Gwyn Evans he was convicted by Carlisle magistrates of larceny of 5s cash, and obtaining 16s cash and a railway ticket by false pretences. He was fined ¬£5 with four days' detention in default; he chose to serve the four days.Jones, p. 29. He had stolen two half crowns from a friend while he was distracted, and obtained a 16s loan from a police station by claiming to have lost his wallet at his mother's funeral.Jones, p. 115. In the following month Evans was given three months' imprisonment at Dudley for driving a motor vehicle without a licence, and using a driving licence with intent to deceive.Jones, pp. 115‚Äì116. Evans enlisted again, into the Lancastrian Brigade, in October 1963 but was discharged on 14 November 1963 when his criminal convictions and failure to disclose them came to light. Evans then moved to Preston where he lodged with Peter Allen and his wife. He worked for an agricultural trading society for about a month. On 21 January 1964 Evans committed his first crime with Allen, removing the lead flashing from an empty house. On 28 January the two broke open a cigarette machine and stole the contents; they then stole a car and a van, using them in burglaries of several other premises. An incompetent attempt to cover up the van's registration number led to their arrest and to fines of ¬£10. From 5 March Evans was employed by a dairy; on 17 March, having only worked two days, he was dismissed for absenteeism. The robbery of West was intended to provide enough money to pay the fines.Jones, pp. 116‚Äì117. When he appeared in court, Evans spoke with a Welsh accent. He claimed that he had adopted the name Evans on finding out that his parents were German and that he had been born at Innsbruck.Jones, pp. 112‚Äì113. Peter Allen Peter Anthony Allen was born at Wallasey, Cheshire, on 4 April 1943, the second son of Richard Thomas Allen. After attending a secondary modern school in Wallasey, he too left at age 15. He obtained but lost two jobs within a month, dismissed for carelessness, but later found employment as a pipe-cleaner for three months. On 10 July 1958 he enlisted as a junior gunner in the Junior Leaders Regiment of the Royal Artillery, serving for 11 months before being discharged on 13 June 1959 as \\"no longer required\\"; he was given a good reference. For two years after leaving the army, Allen worked for two trucking companies; he was dismissed by the second in October 1961 when he was given a promotion and was unable to handle the responsibility.Jones, pp. 109‚Äì110. While he was working as a trucker, Allen received his first criminal conviction, for aiding and abetting the taking of a car in August 1960; he was given a conditional discharge.Jones, p. 111. On 11 November 1961 Allen married Mary, a cinema usherette; the couple had a Catholic wedding, and moved to Manchester. Later that month he found employment at a scrap-dealer, being dismissed in April 1962 for poor timekeeping. Six months' work in a dairy was followed by six months in a steel works, Allen having moved to Preston in April 1963. He found a job as a labourer with an agricultural trading society, but after two months he injured his back and was unable to work; he was not dismissed until January 1964. Later that month he committed the various robbery offences with Evans. In February 1964 he was taken on by a Preston dairy, but was dismissed for absenteeism after a month.Jones, pp. 110‚Äì111. Crime and arrest John West, known to his friends as Jack, was a bachelor who lived alone at 28 Kings Avenue, Seaton, Cumberland. Aged 53, he had worked for 34 years as a van driver for the Lakeland Laundry in Workington.Jones, p. 11. After a normal working day, West had returned to his home just before 6.00pm on Monday 6 April 1964. At about 3:00 the following morning his next-door neighbour was awoken by a noise in West's house and, looking out of the window, observed a car disappearing down the street. The neighbour called the police, who found West dead from severe head injuries and a stab wound to the chest.Jones, pp. 13‚Äì14. In his house the police found a raincoat in the pockets of which was a medallion and Army Memo Form. The medallion was inscribed \\"G.O. Evans, July, 1961\\", and the memo form had the name \\"Miss Norma O'Brian\\" on it, together with a Liverpool address.Jones, p. 24. Liverpool Police traced a Norma O'Brien at the address; she was a 17-year-old Liverpool factory worker who told the police that in the autumn of 1963, while staying with her sister and brother- in-law in Preston, she had met a man called \\"Ginger Owen Evans\\". She also confirmed that she had seen Evans wearing the medallion. She was driven up to Kendal, Westmorland, and identified the medallion.Jones, pp. 24‚Äì5. Evans and Allen had stolen a car (a black 1959 Ford Prefect, registration NXC 771) to go to West's house, and later abandoned it in a builders' yard in Ormskirk, Lancashire. Evans had asked a neighbour whether he could leave it there, and the neighbour thought his behaviour suspicious; she reported it to the police on the evening of Tuesday 7 April.Jones, pp. 33‚Äì34. The police found that the car had been stolen and matched the descriptions given in Seaton; with descriptions of the car and pictures of Evans, they traced its route back to Lancashire. The police also traced Evans, through his parents, as well as criminal and army records, to Allen's address in Preston. At 1.00pm on Wednesday 8 April, less than 36 hours after West's murder, the police turned up (in search of Evans) at Allen's home in Clarendon Road, Preston.Jones, p. 44. Allen agreed to go to the police station in Preston, and was then driven up to Kendal and then to Workington (where the murder squad were based). In questioning Allen claimed to have been home with his wife and \\"Sandy Evans\\" on the night of the murder.Jones, p. 45. He said his wife was visiting her mother in Manchester, and gave the address. A Bolton police officer went to the address to find only the mother there; he left telling her he would wait outside for Allen's wife to return, and a few hours later she did return and went out immediately to the police car to tell the officer where to find Evans. Evans was soon found on a street corner at Phillips Park Road in Miles Platting and a search revealed West's watch.Jones, pp. 49‚Äì50. Taken initially to the police station in Middleton, when told he was being arrested on suspicion of murder Evans admitted that he, together with Allen, Allen's wife and two children, had gone to borrow money from West. Evans accused Allen of sole responsibility for the murder. He and Mrs Allen were then driven up to Workington.Jones, pp. 51‚Äì3. Interrogation Allen initially stood by his claim not to have done anything on the Monday night, but changed his mind when he was told that his wife and Evans were in custody. He explained that Evans had suggested robbing West, and had initially gone into West's house on his own. Evans had then let Allen in, hoping that West would not notice, but West had come downstairs and so Allen had fought him. He said that Evans had given him an iron bar which he used to hit West. Allen then made a statement along these lines.Jones, pp. 56‚Äì63. Evans claimed West had told him that he should see him if ever he was in Workington and needed money, so he had gone to ask for a loan. However, he said that Allen had forced his way into West's house intent on robbery, and that Allen had been the only one to attack West. During questioning, Evans spontaneously mentioned that he knew nothing about a knife and did not have one; until this point, the police had not revealed that West had been stabbed. Evans admitted to stealing West's watch.Jones, pp. 64‚Äì71. Mrs Allen's statement supported her husband's account that Evans had come out to invite him in. She reported that she had asked the two men what had happened in the house, and that Evans had said both had attacked West.Jones, pp. 73‚Äì7. At 1.15am on Thursday 9 April, less than 48 hours after the murder, both Evans and Allen were charged.Jones, p. 78. Trial Allen and Evans were committed for trial by Workington Magistrates after a two-day hearing. The trial was initially put down for Lancaster Assizes, but on application by the defence was transferred to Manchester Assizes.Jones, pp. 86‚Äì89. The joint trial before Mr Justice Ashworth began on 23 June; Joseph Cantley QC led the prosecution, with Allen defended by F. J. Nance and R. G. Hamilton, and Evans defended by Griffith Guthrie Jones QC.Jones, p. 86. The indictment was for capital murder under the Homicide Act 1957, because West had been killed in the course of a theft (there was an additional charge of robbery with aggravation of two bank pass books and a gold watch).Jones, p. 89. Allen claimed only to have struck West a few blows, and that Evans used the knife. Evans' defence was that the robbery had been suggested by Allen (if West refused a loan), and he had only gone along with it provided there was no violence.Jones, p. 94. The most important witness at the trial was Mrs Allen, who was called in her husband's defence. She stuck to her statement that Evans had let Allen into West's house, and that both men had been responsible for attacking West. She also testified that Evans had thrown the knife used to murder West out of the window of the car at Windermere, Westmorland, and that Evans had made an incriminatory remark apparently referring to stabbing West. In cross-examination she accepted that Evans had been more than a lodger to her; Evans' counsel then produced affectionate letters which she had written to Evans in Durham Prison while he was awaiting trial. The affectionate tone had suddenly ended when she heard Evans' account of the murder at the Magistrates' Court, and she had then written of her \\"deep and bitter hatred\\" of him. The judge later directed the jury to treat her evidence with caution; however the prosecution obtained permission to introduce her first statement which showed that her story had remained consistent.Jones, pp. 90‚Äì94. In summing up, the judge asked the jury to decide whether the murder had actually been committed by one of the two men alone; in the latter case the other would be found guilty only of non-capital murder at the most. After considering the case for three hoursEvans and Allen: judge's summation, liverpoolecho.co.uk; accessed 11 September 2016. the jury found both men equally guilty, and both were sentenced to \\"suffer death in the manner authorised by law\\".Jones, pp. 97‚Äì98. Hangings Both men appealed, with the appeal heard by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Parker of Waddington, Mr Justice Winn and Mr Justice Widgery on 20 July. Judgment was given the following day dismissing the appeal.Jones, pp. 99‚Äì103. The date for the execution of the death sentence was set at 13 August. Under the law, the Home Secretary had to decide whether to advise the Queen to exercise the prerogative of mercy and commute the death sentence to life imprisonment; of 48 death sentences passed since the 1957 Act, 19 people had been reprieved. Only two executions had taken place in England in 1963 (those of Russell Pascoe and Dennis Whitty), and none so far in 1964. According to author Elwyn Jones, the police in the north-west expected a reprieve.Jones, p. 104. A recent reprieve for a notably brutal murderer from Lancashire may have led opinion in Preston to believe that a reprieve was likely for Allen and Evans,Joseph William Masters, from Clitheroe, who was convicted at Lancaster Assizes on 1 May 1964 of the capital murder of James Littler. Masters was to have been hanged at Walton Prison on 5 June but was reprieved three days before. and a petition demanding their hanging was started (there was also a smaller petition calling for a reprieve). On 10 August, the Home Office sent out letters announcing that the Secretary of State had \\"failed to discover any sufficient ground to justify him in advising Her Majesty to interfere with the due course of law\\" in both cases.Jones, pp. 106‚Äì107. Gwynne Owen Evans was hanged by executioner Harry Allen at Manchester's Strangeways Prison at 8:00 am on 13 August 1964, assisted by Royston Rickard. At the same time, Peter Allen was hanged at Liverpool's Walton Prison by Robert Leslie Stewart, assisted by Harry Robinson. These were the last two judicial executions of death sentences in Britain. Aftermath Mary Allen later married Billy Price, who had been one of her husband's close friends. He adopted Allen's sons Mark and Richard. Mary Allen died in 1980 aged 37. According to medical reports released to the National Archives in the summer of 2017, Gwynne Evans had 'serious psychological problems' which ‚Äì had his defence team entered a plea of diminished responsibility at his trial ‚Äì could have led to his escaping being hanged.

He was a Candidate for the World Chess Championship on eight occasions (1948, 1950, 1953, 1956, 1959, 1965, 1983, and 1985). Smyslov twice tied for first place at the Soviet Championships (1949, 1955), and his total of 17 Chess Olympiad medals won is an all-time record. In five European Team Championships, Smyslov won ten gold medals. Smyslov remained active and successful in competitive chess well after the age of sixty. Despite failing eyesight, he remained active in the occasional composition of chess problems and studies until shortly before his death in 2010. Besides chess, he was an accomplished baritone singer.  Early years  Smyslov first became interested in chess at the age of six. His father, Vasily Osipovich Smyslov, worked as an engineering technician and had represented the St. Petersburg Technical Institute in intercollegiate chess competitions. Smyslov's father had also studied chess for a time under the tutelage of Mikhail Chigorin and the senior Smyslov became the boy's first teacher. The elder Smyslov gave his son a copy of Alexander Alekhine's book My Best Games of Chess 1908‚Äì1923 and the future world champion would later write that this book became his constant reference. He would also write that \\"...I was later to read everything that my father had in his library: Dufresne's handbook, separate numbers of the Soviet chess magazines Chess and Chess Sheet, the text-books of Lasker and Capablanca, and the collections of games of Soviet and international tournaments. The games of the great Russian chess master M. I. Chigorin made an indelible impression on me; it was with interest that I read the various declarations on questions of strategy by A. I. Nimzovitch; I studied attentively the genius of prominent Soviet masters.\\"Fine, R. (Ed.). (1976). The World's Greatest Chess Games. New York: Dover Publications, Inc. Smyslov's competitive chess experiences began at the age of 14, when he started taking part in classification tournaments. In 1938, at age 17, Smyslov won the USSR Junior Championship. That same year, he tied for 1st‚Äì2nd places in the Moscow City Championship, with 12¬Ω/17. However, Smyslov's first attempt at adult competition outside his own city fell short; he placed 12th‚Äì13th in the Leningrad‚ÄìMoscow International tournament of 1939 with 8/17 in an exceptionally strong field. In the Moscow Championship of 1939‚Äì40 Smyslov placed 2nd‚Äì3rd with 9/13.  War years  In his first Soviet final, the 1940 USSR Chess Championship (Moscow, URS-ch12), he performed exceptionally well for 3rd place with 13/19, finishing ahead of the reigning champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This tournament was the strongest Soviet final up to that time, as it included several players, such as Paul Keres and Vladas Mikƒónas, from countries annexed by the USSR, as part of the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet Pact of 1939. The Soviet Federation held a further tournament of the top six from the 1940 event, and this was called the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, one of the strongest tournaments ever organized. The format saw each player meet his opponents four times. The players were Botvinnik, Keres, Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky, Igor Bondarevsky, and Andor Lilienthal. Smyslov scored 10/20 for third place, behind Botvinnik and Keres. This proved that Smyslov was of genuine world-class Grandmaster strength at age 20, a very rare achievement at that time. World War II forced a halt to most international chess, but several tournaments involving Soviet players only were still organized. Smyslov was exempted from military service due to being severely nearsighted, and he won the 1942 Moscow Championship outright with a powerful 12/15. At Kuibyshev 1942, he placed second with 8/11. In a strong field at Sverdlovsk 1943, Smyslov tied for 3rd‚Äì4th places with 8/14. In the 1943‚Äì44 Moscow Championship, Smyslov tied for 3rd‚Äì4th with 11¬Ω/16. He finished second in the 1944 USSR Championship at Moscow (URS-ch13) with 10¬Ω/16. He emerged as champion from the 1944‚Äì45 Moscow Championship with 13/16. By this juncture, Smyslov had advanced into the group of the top three Soviet players, along with Botvinnik and Keres, who was playing in Nazi-occupied Europe during the war. As the war ended, organized chess picked up again. But Smyslov's form hit a serious slump in the immediate post-war period. In the 1945 USSR Championship at Moscow (URS-ch14), Smyslov was in the middle of the very powerful field with 8¬Ω/17; the winner was Botvinnik, with Boleslavsky and the new star David Bronstein occupying second and third places. At Tallinn 1945, Smyslov had the worst result of his career, scoring just 6¬Ω/15 in a not especially strong field. It was little better in the Moscow Championship of 1945‚Äì46, as he could only score 7¬Ω/15 for a tie of 7th‚Äì11th places, as Bronstein won. Then in the Moscow Championship of 1946, Smyslov scored just 8¬Ω/15, for a tie of 3rd‚Äì6th places, as Bronstein won again. During this period he scored just 31/62 in those four tournaments, for 50%. Nevertheless, Smyslov's earlier strong results secured him one of the five Soviet places in the first really strong post-war international tournament, at Groningen, Netherlands, in August 1946. This event, the Howard Staunton Memorial, was won by Botvinnik with 14¬Ω/19, half a point ahead of former World Champion Max Euwe. Smyslov finished third with 12¬Ω/19, and this confirmed his status as one of the world's top players. Smyslov found it tough going for the next while, however, once he was back playing in Soviet events. In the next Soviet Championship (URS-ch15, Leningrad 1947), he tied for 3rd‚Äì4th places with 12/19, as Keres won. At P√§rnu 1947, Smyslov scored 8/13 for a tied 4th‚Äì6th places, as Keres won again. At Warsaw 1947, Smyslov scored 6/9 to tie for 2nd‚Äì5th places; the winner was Svetozar Gligoriƒá. In the Mikhail Chigorin Memorial tournament, Moscow 1947, Smyslov tied for 3rd‚Äì4th places, with 10/15, as Botvinnik won. His results showed a consistent pattern of high finishes against strong company, but with virtually no tournament championships. Smyslov had never actually won an adult tournament (other than the Moscow City Championship) before he played in the 1948 World Championship Tournament.  World title challenger  Smyslov was one of the five players selected to compete for the 1948 World Chess Championship tournament to determine who should succeed the late Alexander Alekhine as champion. His selection was questioned in some quarters, but this criticism was amply rebutted when he finished second behind Mikhail Botvinnik, with a score of 11/20. With his second-place finish from the 1948 World Championship, Smyslov was admitted directly into the 1950 Budapest Candidates' tournament without needing to play in qualifying events. Smyslov scored 10/18 for third place, behind Bronstein and Boleslavsky, who tied for first place. Smyslov's third place automatically qualified him into the next Candidates' tournament. He was awarded the International Grandmaster title in 1950 by FIDE on its inaugural list. After winning the Candidates Tournament in Z√ºrich 1953, with 18/28, two points ahead of Keres, Bronstein, and Samuel Reshevsky, Smyslov played a match with Botvinnik for the title the following year. Sited at Moscow, the match ended in a draw, after 24 games (seven wins each and ten draws), meaning that Botvinnik retained his title.  World Champion  Botvinnik vs. Smyslov (right) at the World Chess Championship 1957 Smyslov again won the Candidates' Tournament at Amsterdam in 1956, which led to another world championship match against Botvinnik in 1957. Assisted by trainers Vladimir Makogonov and Vladimir Simagin, Smyslov won with the score 12¬Ω‚Äì9¬Ω. The following year, Botvinnik exercised his right to a rematch, and won the title back with a final score of 12¬Ω‚Äì10¬Ω. Smyslov later said his health suffered during the return match, as he came down with pneumonia, but he also acknowledged that Botvinnik had prepared very thoroughly. Over the course of the three World Championship matches, Smyslov had won 18 games to Botvinnik's 17 (with 34 draws), and yet he was only champion for a year. Nonetheless Smyslov wrote in his autobiographical games collection Smyslov's Best Games, \\"I have no reason to complain of my fate. I fulfilled my dream and became the seventh world champion in the history of chess.\\"  Later World Championships  Smyslov at the Amsterdam Interzonal in 1964 Smyslov did not qualify for another World Championship, but continued to play in World Championship qualifying events. In 1959, he was a Candidate, but finished fourth in the qualifying tournament held in Yugoslavia, which was won by the rising superstar Mikhail Tal. He missed out in 1962, but was back in 1964, following a first-place tie at the Amsterdam Interzonal, with 17/23. However he lost his first-round match to Efim Geller. In 1983, at the age of 62, he went through to the Candidates' Final (the match to determine who plays the champion, in that case Anatoly Karpov), losing 8¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω at Vilnius 1984 to Garry Kasparov, who was 21 at the time, and who went on to beat Karpov to become world champion in 1985. He had beaten Zolt√°n Ribli 6¬Ω‚Äì4¬Ω in the semifinal, but drew his quarter-final match against Robert H√ºbner 7‚Äì7, with the advancing player (Smyslov) determined only by the spin of a roulette wheel. His final Candidates' appearance was the Montpellier 1985 tournament, where he did not advance.  Soviet Championships  Smyslov was a frequent competitor at the Soviet Championships and enjoyed some notable successes. In 1940, while still a teenager, he finished third behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. At the 13th Championship in 1944, he placed second behind Botvinnik and in 1947, shared third with Bondarevsky, after Keres and Boleslavsky. He was a joint winner of the contest in 1949 and again in 1955 (with Bronstein and Geller respectively). Whilst the 1949 title was shared, the 1955 title was awarded to Geller after a play-off. Much later in his career he showed that he could still mount a credible challenge; he took a share of third place in 1969 (behind Petrosian and Polugaevsky) and in 1971, was joint runner-up with Tal, after Savon. He was ranked by FIDE as one of the top 15 players in the world from the late 1940s into the early 1980s, a stretch of almost 40 years.  Post-war tournament record  Smyslov maintained an active tournament schedule throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s, registering many top three finishes in some of the most prestigious tournaments of the period. In 1950, he was second behind Kotov at Venice and in 1951, won the Chigorin Memorial, held in Leningrad. He shared third place with Botvinnik at Budapest (Mar√≥czy Memorial) in 1952, after Keres and Geller. In 1953, he won a training tournament in Gagra and finished third at Bucharest, behind Tolush and Petrosian. At the 1954‚Äì55 edition of the Hastings Congress, he shared first place with Keres. At Zagreb 1955, he was sole winner, two clear points ahead of the field. He continued his winning streak at Moscow's Alekhine Memorial in 1956, a victory shared with his constant rival, Botvinnik. During this period, there were several triumphs in his city of birth, when he shared first place with Bronstein and Spassky at the inaugural edition of the Moscow Central Chess Club international tournament series (sometimes also referred as an Alekhine Memorial) in 1959, was a joint winner in both 1960 (with Kholmov) and 1961 (with Vasiukov), and won outright in 1963. His good form continued throughout the 1960s. There were shares of second place at Dortmund 1961 (after Taimanov) and at Mar del Plata 1962 (after Polugaevsky). He traveled again to Hastings at the end of 1962 and registered third place behind Gligoric and Kotov. In 1963, he was second at Sochi (Chigorin Memorial) after Polugaevsky. His visit to Havana's Capablanca Memorial in 1964 resulted in a share of first with the East German, Uhlmann. He took outright first at the same tournament the following year. In 1966, there were victories at Mar del Plata and at the Rubinstein Memorial in Polanica Zdroj. In 1967, he was second to Fischer at Monte Carlo, won at Moscow and took second after Stein at the city's Alekhine Memorial tournament. He placed third the same year at the Capablanca Memorial in Havana (after Larsen and Taimanov) and finished third again at Palma de Mallorca 1967 and Monte Carlo 1968, the latter two events both being headed by Larsen and Botvinnik. This was also the year he repeated his previous success at Polanica Zdroj, taking outright first. His next trip to Hastings also ended in triumph, as he took clear first at the 1968‚Äì69 edition. The 1960s drew to a close with victory at Monte Carlo 1969 (shared with Portisch) and a share of third place at Skopje 1969 (with Uhlmann and Kholmov, after Hort and Matuloviƒá). Karpov (left), Euwe (bottom) and Smyslov at the 1977 Tilburg chess tournament While less prolific than in previous decades, Smyslov played many strong tournaments in the 1970s and even into the 1980s and beyond. He was joint runner-up with Hort, Gligoric and Korchnoi at Rovinj/Zagreb 1970, after Fischer. A winner at Amsterdam in 1971, he came third at the Alekhine Memorial (Moscow) the same year, after Karpov and Stein. At Las Palmas 1972, he was second equal with Larsen, behind Portisch and in 1973, topped the Capablanca Memorial in Cienfuegos. First place followed at Reykjav√≠k in 1974 and at the Venice tournament of the same year, he finished second behind Liberzon. Then followed a second place at the Alexander Memorial (Teesside) in 1975 (after Geller), a first place at Szolnok (also 1975), and a multi-way share of second at the large Lone Pine Open of 1976 (Petrosian won). He finished third behind Romanishin and Tal at Leningrad in 1977, when all three eclipsed the efforts of then world champion Anatoly Karpov. In 1978, he won at S√£o Paulo and finished with a share of second at Buenos Aires, after Andersson. As the seventies ended, he took first place at Berlin 1979, this time shared with Csom. Notable outcomes for 1980 included joint first places at San Miguel (with Browne, Panno, Jaime Emma) and at Copenhagen (the Politiken Cup, with Mikhalchishin). The same year, he finished second at Bar, after Petrosian and second at Baguio, after Torre. At Moscow 1981, he joined Kasparov and Polugaevsky in second place, behind Karpov. A further Hastings visit in 1981‚Äì82 resulted in a share of second place, with Speelman, after Kupreichik. He was first at Graz in 1984 and first equal at Copenhagen (Politiken Cup) 1986 with Chernin, Pigusov and Cserna. He played at Reggio Emilia over the New Year of 1986‚Äì87 and shared second spot with Hort, Chernin and Spassky, after Ribli. At Hastings in 1988‚Äì89, he took a share of third with Gulko and Speelman, behind Short and Korchnoi. Smyslov remained on FIDE's top 100 list until he was 70 years old. His tournament appearances were fewer in the 1990s, but results included a share of first place at Buenos Aires 1990 and a share of second at Malm√∂ (Sigeman) in 1997, after Hellers.  Team competition  Smyslov represented the Soviet Union a total of nine times at chess Olympiads, from 1952 to 1972 inclusive, excepting only 1962 and 1966. He contributed strongly to team gold medal wins on each occasion he played, winning a total of eight individual medals. His total of 17 Olympiad medals won, including team and individual medals, is an all-time Olympiad record, according to olimpbase.org. At Helsinki 1952, he played second board, and won the individual gold medal with 10¬Ω/13. At Amsterdam 1954, he was again on second board, scored 9/12, and took the individual bronze medal. At Moscow 1956, he scored 8¬Ω/13 on second board, but failed to win a medal. At Munich 1958, he made 9¬Ω/13 on second board, good for the silver individual medal. At Leipzig 1960, he was dropped to first reserve, and made a great score of 11¬Ω/13, which won the gold medal. After missing out on selection in 1962, he returned for Tel Aviv 1964, on third board, and won the gold medal with 11/13. He missed selection in 1966, but returned with a vengeance for Lugano 1968, and made a phenomenal 11/12 for another gold medal as second reserve. At Siegen 1970, he was first reserve, and scored 8/11 for the bronze medal. His final Olympiad was Skopje 1972, where at age 51 he played third board and scored 11/14, good for the silver medal. His overall Olympiad score is an imposing 90 points in 113 games (+69‚àí2=42), for 79.6%. This performance is the fifth all-time best for players participating in at least four Olympiads. Smyslov also represented the USSR in five European Team Championships, and emerged with a perfect medals' record: he won five team gold medals and five board gold medals. His total score in these events was (+19‚àí1=15), for 75.7%. From olimpbase.org, here is his European teams' data. * Vienna 1957: board 1, 3¬Ω/6 (+2‚àí1=3), board and team gold medals; * Oberhausen 1961: board 5, 8/9 (+7‚àí0=2), board and team gold medals; * Hamburg 1965: board 4, 6/9 (+3‚àí0=6), board and team gold medals; * Kapfenberg 1970: board 5, 5/6 (+4‚àí0=2), board and team gold medals; * Bath, Somerset 1973: board 6, 4/5 (+3‚àí0=2), board and team gold medals. Smyslov played for the USSR in both the 1970 and 1984 matches against teams representing the Rest of the World. He was on board six at Belgrade in 1970, and on board four at London in 1984, with the Soviets winning both matches.  Final years  Smyslov congratulates Yuri Averbakh at his 80th birthday and presents him with a book of his own chess studies. In 1991, Smyslov won the inaugural World Senior Chess Championship. With a FIDE rating still around 2400 as of the year 2000, the 80-year old grandmaster participated in what was to be his final tournament, the Klompendans Veterans Vs. Ladies Tournament in Amsterdam. The highlight of the match was his rout of Zsofia Polgar, leaving the all-time record between the two as 5‚Äì1‚Äì3. Some of the matches were adjourned early as draws due to his failing eyesight, and Smyslov officially retired from competitive play after this tournament. His Elo rating after this event was 2494. Smyslov died of congestive heart failure in a Moscow hospital on the morning of 27 March 2010, three days after his 89th birthday. Reports circulated that his final years were lived in near-poverty and that he could not afford badly-needed eye surgery. It was also reported that Smyslov and his wife Nadezhda mostly lived off of income from renting their apartment out and that there was nobody around to check up on or care for them.Vasily Smyslov 1921‚Äì2010. The Week in Chess (27 March 2010). Retrieved on 2018-05-04.  Legacy  Smyslov was known for his positional style, and, in particular, his precise handling of the endgame, but many of his games featured spectacular tactical shots as well. His opening repertoire was conventional for the 1950s‚Äì60s era, featuring mainly the Ruy Lopez and English Opening as White, and the Sicilian Defense and Nimzo-Indian Defense as Black. He made enormous contributions to chess opening theory in many openings, including the English Opening, Gr√ºnfeld Defence, and the Sicilian Defence. He has a variation of the Closed Ruy Lopez named after him: the line runs 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 h6. In the Gr√ºnfeld Defence, the continuation 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Qb3 dxc4 6.Qxc4 0-0 7.e4 Bg4 8.Be3 Nfd7 is known as the Smyslov Variation and remains a major variation. Smyslov also successfully revived the Fianchetto Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 g6) in the 1970s. In the Slav Defence, the sideline 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 dxc4 5.a4 Na6 is named the Smyslov Variation. Finally, a variation of the King's Indian Defense is named after him which proceeds with the moves 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.Nf3 0-0 5.Bg5 d6 6.e3. Stanley Kubrick named a character after him in his film 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Opera singer  Smyslov was a baritone singer, and only positively decided upon a chess career after a failed audition with the Bolshoi Theatre in 1950. He occasionally gave recitals during chess tournaments, often accompanied by fellow Grandmaster and concert pianist Mark Taimanov. Smyslov once wrote that he tried to achieve harmony on the chess board, with each piece assisting the others.Smyslov, Vassily (1995) Smyslov's Selected Games. London, Everyman Chess.  Personal life  Smyslov with wife at the 1956 Candidates Tournament For more than 50 years Smyslov was married to Nadezhda Smyslova, a woman three years his elder whose first husband was executed during the Stalin's purges in the early 1940s. They met in 1948. Nadezhda had a son from the first marriage, an aspiring chess player who competed at the World Junior Championships. Vasily and Nadezhda had no further children. Nadezhda often accompanied her husband at major tournaments, providing moral support.24 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ –≤—ã–¥–∞—é—â–µ–º—É—Å—è —à–∞—Ö–º–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç—É –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏–ª–æ—Å—å 87 –ª–µ—Ç. president.org.ua (26 March 2008)–ì–õ–ê–í–ê 1 –ñ–ò–ó–ù–¨ –ò –°–£–î–¨–ë–ê. chesslibrary.ru  Books by Smyslov  *Vasily Smyslov (2003) Smyslov's Best Games, Volume 1: 1935‚Äì1957 (Moravian Chess Publishing House) *Vasily Smyslov (2003) Smyslov's Best Games, Volume 2: 1958‚Äì1995 (Moravian Chess Publishing House) *Vasily Smyslov (1997) Endgame Virtuoso (Cadogan) *Vasily Smyslov (1995) Smyslov's 125 Selected Games (modern edition published by Everyman Chess) *Grigory Levenfish and Vasily Smyslov (1971) Rook Endings (Batsford Edition)  Notable games  *Tigran Petrosian vs Vasily Smyslov, USSR Championship, Moscow 1949, Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation (B84), 0‚Äì1 The first meeting of two future World Champions goes to Smyslov in a precise positional performance. *Vasily Smyslov vs Efim Geller, USSR Championship, Moscow 1951, Sicilian Defence, Closed Variation (B26), 1‚Äì0 Smyslov used the Closed Sicilian periodically throughout his life, and made many important improvements. *Paul Keres vs Vasily Smyslov, Zurich Candidates' Tournament 1953, English Opening: Anglo- Indian Defense.

Lemay, \\"Retrofuturism and Steampunk\\", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 434. Characterized by a blend of old-fashioned \\"retro styles\\" with futuristic technology, retrofuturism explores the themes of tension between past and future, and between the alienating and empowering effects of technology. Primarily reflected in artistic creations and modified technologies that realize the imagined artifacts of its parallel reality, retrofuturism can be seen as \\"an animating perspective on the world\\".Robert Lanham, \\"Introduction\\", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 14 Etymology According to the Oxford English Dictionary, an early use of the term appears in a Bloomingdales advertisement in a 1983 issue of The New York Times. The ad talks of jewellery that is \\"silverized steel and sleek grey linked for a retro-futuristic look\\". In an example more related to retrofuturism as an exploration of past visions of the future, the term appears in the form of ‚Äúretro-futurist‚Äù in a 1984 review of the film Brazil in The New Yorker.

Several websites have referenced a supposed 1967 book published by Pelican Books called Retro- Futurism by T. R. Hinchliffe as the origin of the term, but this account is unverified. There exist no records of this book or author. Historiography Retrofuturism builds on ideas of futurism, but the latter term functions differently in several different contexts. In avant-garde artistic, literary and design circles, futurism is a long-standing and well established term. But in its more popular form, futurism (sometimes referred to as futurology) is \\"an early optimism that focused on the past and was rooted in the nineteenth century, an early-twentieth-century 'golden age' that continued long into the 1960s' Space Age\\".Elizabeth Guffey and Kate C. Lemay, \\"Retrofuturism and Steampunk\\", The Oxford Handbook to Science Fiction, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 435. Retrofuturism is first and foremost based on modern but changing notions of \\"the future\\". As Guffey notes, retrofuturism is \\"a recent neologism\\", but it \\"builds on futurists' fevered visions of space colonies with flying cars, robotic servants, and interstellar travel on display there; where futurists took their promise for granted, retro-futurism emerged as a more skeptical reaction to these dreams\\".Elizabeth Guffey, \\"Crafting Yesterday's Tomorrows: Retro-Futurism, Steampunk, and Making in the Twenty- First Century\\", Journal of Modern Craft 7.3 (November, 2014) p. 254. It took its current shape in the 1970s, a time when technology was rapidly changing. From the advent of the personal computer to the birth of the first test tube baby, this period was characterized by intense and rapid technological change. But many in the general public began to question whether applied science would achieve its earlier promise‚Äîthat life would inevitably improve through technological progress. In the wake of the Vietnam War, environmental depredations, and the energy crisis, many commentators began to question the benefits of applied science. But they also wondered, sometimes in awe, sometimes in confusion, at the scientific positivism evinced by earlier generations. Retrofuturism \\"seeped into academic and popular culture in the 1960s and 1970s\\", inflecting George Lucas's Star Wars and the paintings of pop artist Kenny Scharf alike\\".Elizabeth Guffey, Retro: The Culture of Revival (Reaktion: 2006):155‚Äì157 Surveying the optimistic futurism of the early twentieth century, the historians Joe Corn and Brian Horrigan remind us that retrofuturism is \\"a history of an idea, or a system of ideas‚Äîan ideology. The future, or course, does not exist except as an act of belief or imagination.\\"Joseph J. Corn and Brian Horrigan, Yesterday's Tomorrows: Past Visions of the American Future (Johns Hopkins Press: 1984): xii. Characteristics Retrofuturism incorporates two overlapping trends which may be summarized as the future as seen from the past and the past as seen from the future. The first trend, retrofuturism proper, is directly inspired by the imagined future which existed in the minds of writers, artists, and filmmakers in the pre-1960 period who attempted to predict the future, either in serious projections of existing technology (e.g. in magazines like Science and Invention) or in science fiction novels and stories. Such futuristic visions are refurbished and updated for the present, and offer a nostalgic, counterfactual image of what the future might have been, but is not. The second trend is the inverse of the first: futuristic retro. It starts with the retro appeal of old styles of art, clothing, mores, and then grafts modern or futuristic technologies onto it, creating a m√©lange of past, present, and future elements. Steampunk, a term applying both to the retrojection of futuristic technology into an alternative Victorian age, and the application of neo-Victorian styles to modern technology, is a highly successful version of this second trend. In the movie Space Station 76 (2014), mankind has reached the stars, but clothes, technology, furnitures and above all social taboos are purposely highly reminiscent of the mid-1970s. In practice, the two trends cannot be sharply distinguished, as they mutually contribute to similar visions. Retrofuturism of the first type is inevitably influenced by the scientific, technological, and social awareness of the present, and modern retrofuturistic creations are never simply copies of their pre-1960 inspirations; rather, they are given a new (often wry or ironic) twist by being seen from a modern perspective. In the same way, futuristic retro owes much of its flavor to early science fiction (e.g. the works of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells), and in a quest for stylistic authenticity may continue to draw on writers and artists of the desired period. Both retrofuturistic trends in themselves refer to no specific time. When a time period is supplied for a story, it might be a counterfactual present with unique technology; a fantastic version of the future; or an alternate past in which the imagined (fictitious or projected) inventions of the past were indeed real. The import of retrofuturism has, in recent years, come under considerable discussion. Some, like the German architecture critic Niklas Maak, see retrofuturism as \\"nothing more than an aesthetic feedback loop recalling a lost belief in progress, the old images of the once radically new\\".Niklas Maak, \\"Goodbye Retro-Futurism ¬∑ A farewell to our perpetual nostalgia for the future\\". 032c9 (Summer 2005): p. 117 Bruce McCall calls retrofuturism a \\"faux nostalgia\\"‚Äîthe nostalgia for a future that never happened.Bruce McCall, \\"What is Retro- Futurism?\\" , TED Talk Themes Although retrofuturism, due to the varying time-periods and futuristic visions to which it alludes, does not provide a unified thematic purpose or experience, a common thread is dissatisfaction or discomfort with the present, to which retrofuturism provides a nostalgic contrast. A similar theme is dissatisfaction with the modern world itself. A world of high-speed air transport, computers, and space stations is (by any past standard) \\"futuristic\\"; yet the search for alternative and perhaps more promising futures suggests a feeling that the desired or expected future has failed to materialize. Retrofuturism suggests an alternative path, and in addition to pure nostalgia, may act as a reminder of older but now forgotten ideals. This dissatisfaction also manifests as political commentary in Retrofuturistic literature, in which visionary nostalgia is paradoxically linked to a utopian future modelled after conservative values as seen in the example of Fox News' use of BioShock's aesthetic in a 2014 broadcast. Retrofuturism also implies a reevaluation of technology. Unlike the total rejection of post-medieval technology found in most fantasy genres, or the embrace of any and all possible technologies found in some science-fiction, retrofuturism calls for a human-scale, largely comprehensible technology, amenable to tinkering and less opaque than modern black-box technology. Retrofuturism is not universally optimistic, and when its points of reference touch on gloomy periods like World War II, or the paranoia of the Cold War, it may itself become bleak and dystopian. In such cases, the alternative reality inspires fear, not hope, though it may still be coupled with nostalgia for a world of greater moral as well as mechanical transparency. =Fashion= [Retro]futuristic clothing is a particular imagined vision of the clothing that might be worn in the distant future, typically found in science fiction and science fiction films of the 1940s onwards, but also in journalism and other popular culture. The garments envisioned have most commonly been either one-piece garments, skin-tight garments, or both, typically ending up looking like either overalls or leotards, often worn together with plastic boots. In many cases, there is an assumption that the clothing of the future will be highly uniform. The clich√© of futuristic clothing has now become part of the idea of retrofuturism. Futuristic fashion plays on these now-hackneyed stereotypes, and recycles them as elements into the creation of real-world clothing fashions. \\"We've actually seen this look creeping up on the runway as early as 1995, though it hasn't been widely popular or acceptable street wear even through 2008,\\" said Brooke Kelley, fashion editor and Glamour magazine writer. \\"For the last 20 years, fashion has reviewed the times of past, decade by decade, and what we are seeing now is a combination of different eras into one complete look.

The agency designated five buildings (47‚Äì55 West 28th Street) individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the Save Tin Pan Alley initiative (SaveTinPanAlley.org) of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association.Staff (December 10, 2019) \\"LPC Designates Five Historic Buildings Associated with Tin Pan Alley\\" (press release) New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock & roll, which was centered on the Brill Building. On December 10, 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission individually designated five buildings on West 28th Street as landmarks for their historical significance as part of Tin Pan Alley: 47, 49, 51, 53 and 55 West 28th Street.Staff (December 10, 2019) \\"LPC Designates Five Historic Buildings Associated with Tin Pan Alley\\" (press release) New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Origin of the name Various explanations have been advanced to account for the origins of the term \\"Tin Pan Alley\\". The most popular account holds that it was originally a derogatory reference by Monroe H. Rosenfeld in the New York Herald to the collective sound made by many \\"cheap upright pianos\\" all playing different tunes being reminiscent of the banging of tin pans in an alleyway.Charlton (2011), p.3 Quote: the \\"term Tin Pan Alley referred to the thin, tinny tone quality of cheap upright pianos used in music publisher's offices.\\"Hamm (1983), p.341 However, no article by Rosenfeld that uses the term has been found.Friedmann, Jonathan L. (2018). Musical Aesthetics: An Introduction to Concepts, Theories, and Functions. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing. p. 119. Simon Napier-Bell quotes an account of the origin of the name published in a 1930 book about the music business. In this version, popular songwriter Harry von Tilzer was being interviewed about the area around 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, where many music publishers had offices. Von Tilzer had modified his expensive Kindler & Collins piano by placing strips of paper down the strings to give the instrument a more percussive sound. The journalist told von Tilzer, \\"Your Kindler & Collins sounds exactly like a tin can. I'll call the article 'Tin Pan Alley'.\\"Naper- Bell, Simon, Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de-ay: The Beginning of the Music Business, (2014), p.7: quoted from Goldberg, Isaac and George Gershwin, Tin Pan Alley: A Chronicle of the American Popular Music Racket, (1930) In any case, the name was firmly attached by the fall of 1908, when The Hampton Magazine published an article titled \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" about 28th Street.Browne, Porter Emerson (October 1908) \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" The Hampton Magazine v.21, n.4, pp.455-462 According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, \\"tin pan\\" was slang for \\"a decrepit piano\\" (1882), and the term came to mean a \\"hit song writing business\\" by 1907.\\"tin pan alley\\" etyomonline.com, January 14, 2020 With time, the nickname came to describe the American music publishing industry in general. The term then spread to the United Kingdom, where \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" is also used to describe Denmark Street in London's West End. In the 1920s the street became known as \\"Britain's Tin Pan Alley\\" because of its large number of music shops.\\"Tin Pan Alley (London)\\", musicpilgrimages.com, November 7, 2009 West 28th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan housed the sheet-music publishers that were the center of American popular music in the early 20th century. The buildings shown were designated as historic landmarks in 2019. Origin of song publishing in New York City In the mid-19th century, copyright control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. Songwriters would literally bang on the doors of Tin Pan Alley businesses to get new material. The commercial center of the popular music publishing industry changed during the course of the 19th century, starting in Boston and moving to Philadelphia, Chicago and Cincinnati before settling in New York City under the influence of new and vigorous publishers which concentrated on vocal music. The two most enterprising New York publishers were Willis Woodard and T.B. Harms, the first companies to specialize in popular songs rather than hymns or classical music.Hischak, Thomas S. (ndg) \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" on Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online/Oxford University Press Naturally, these firms were located in the entertainment district, which, at the time, was centered on Union Square. Witmark was the first publishing house to move to West 28th Street as the entertainment district gradually shifted uptown, and by the late 1890s most publishers had followed their lead. The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers - often connected with commercial printers or music stores - continued to flourish throughout the country, and there were important regional music publishing centers in Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, and Boston. When a tune became a significant local hit, rights to it were usually purchased from the local publisher by one of the big New York firms. In its prime The song publishers who created Tin Pan Alley frequently had backgrounds as salesmen. Isadore Witmark previously sold water filters and Leo Feist had sold corsets. Joe Stern and Edward B. Marks had sold neckties and buttons, respectively.Whitcomb, Ian (1973) After the Ball. Allen Lane, p.44 The music houses in lower Manhattan were lively places, with a steady stream of songwriters, vaudeville and Broadway performers, musicians, and \\"song pluggers\\" coming and going. Aspiring songwriters came to demonstrate tunes they hoped to sell. When tunes were purchased from unknowns with no previous hits, the name of someone with the firm was often added as co-composer (in order to keep a higher percentage of royalties within the firm), or all rights to the song were purchased outright for a flat fee (including rights to put someone else's name on the sheet music as the composer). An extraordinary number of Jewish East European immigrants became the music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley - the most famous being Irving Berlin. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses. \\"Song pluggers\\" were pianists and singers who represented the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song pluggers on staff. Other pluggers were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song pluggers were George Gershwin, Harry Warren, Vincent Youmans and Al Sherman. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as \\"booming\\": it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At Shapiro Bernstein, Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at Madison Square Garden: \\"They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We'd sing a song to them thirty times a night. They'd cheer and yell, and we kept pounding away at them. When people walked out, they'd be singing the song. They couldn't help it.\\"Naper-Bell, Simon, Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de- ay: The Beginning of the Music Business, (2014), p.6 When vaudeville performers played New York City, they would often visit various Tin Pan Alley firms to find new songs for their acts. Second- and third-rate performers often paid for rights to use a new song, while famous stars were given free copies of publisher's new numbers or were paid to perform them, the publishers knowing this was valuable advertising. Initially Tin Pan Alley specialized in melodramatic ballads and comic novelty songs, but it embraced the newly popular styles of the cakewalk and ragtime music. Later on jazz and blues were incorporated, although less completely, as Tin Pan Alley was oriented towards producing songs that amateur singers or small town bands could perform from printed music. In the 1910s and 1920s Tin Pan Alley published pop-songs and dance numbers created in newly popular jazz and blues styles. Plaque commemorating Tin Pan Alley Influence on law and business A group of Tin Pan Alley music houses formed the Music Publishers Association of the United States on June 11, 1895, and unsuccessfully lobbied the federal government in favor of the Treloar Copyright Bill, which would have changed the term of copyright for published music from 24 to 40 years, renewable for an additional 20 instead of 14 years. The bill, if enacted, would also have included music among the subject matter covered by the Manufacturing clause of the International Copyright Act of 1891. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded in 1914 to aid and protect the interests of established publishers and composers. New members were only admitted with sponsorship of existing members. The term and established business methodologies associated with Tin Pan Alley persisted into the 1960s when innovative artists like Bob Dylan helped establish new norms. Referring to the dominant conventions of music publishers of the early 20th century, \\"Tin Pan Alley is gone,\\" Bob Dylan proclaimed in 1985, \\"I put an end to it. People can record their own songs now.\\" Contributions to World War II During the Second World War, Tin Pan Alley and the federal government teamed up to produce a war song that would inspire the American public to support the fight against the Axis, something they both \\"seemed to believe ... was vital to the war effort\\".Smith, Kathleen E. R. (2003). God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War. Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky. pp. 2‚Äì6 The Office of War Information was in charge of this project, and believed that Tin Pan Alley contained \\"a reservoir of talent and competence capable of influencing people's feelings and opinions\\" that it \\"might be capable of even greater influence during wartime than that of George M. Cohan's 'Over There' during World War I.\\" The song \\"Over There\\" can be said to be the most popular and resonant patriotic song associated with World War I. Due to the large fan base of Tin Pan Alley, the government believed that this sector of the music business would be far-reaching in spreading patriotic sentiments. In the United States Congress, congressmen quarrelled over a proposal to exempt musicians and other entertainers from the draft in order to remain in the country to boost morale. Stateside, these artists and performers were continuously using available media to promote the war effort and to demonstrate a commitment to victory. However, the proposal was contested by those who strongly believed that only those who provided more substantial contributions to the war effort should benefit from any draft legislation. As the war progressed, those in charge of writing the would-be national war song began to understand that the interest of the public lay elsewhere. Since the music would take up such a large amount of airtime, it was imperative that the writing be consistent with the war message that the radio was carrying throughout the nation. In her book, God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War, Kathleen E. R. Smith writes that \\"escapism seemed to be a high priority for music listeners\\", leading \\"the composers of Tin Pan Alley [to struggle] to write a war song that would appeal both to civilians and the armed forces\\". By the end of the war, no such song had been produced that could rival hits like \\"Over There\\" from World War I. Whether or not the number of songs circulated from Tin Pan Alley between 1939 and 1945 was greater than during the First World War is still debated. In his book The Songs That Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front, John Bush Jones cites Jeffrey C. Livingstone as claiming that Tin Pan Alley released more songs during World War I than it did in World War II.John Bush Jones, God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War (Lebanon: University Press of Kentucky, 2003), pp. 32‚Äì33 Jones, on the other hand, argues that \\"there is also strong documentary evidence that the output of American war-related songs during World War II was most probably unsurpassed in any other war\\".

Even if lineage details are unknown, clan members may be organized around a founding member or apical ancestor. Clans, in indigenous societies, tend to be exogamous, meaning that their members cannot marry one another. Clans preceded more centralized forms of community organization and government, and exist in every country. Members may identify with a coat of arms or other symbol to show that they are an independent clan. The kinship-based bonds may also have a symbolic ancestor, whereby the clan shares a \\"stipulated\\" common ancestor that is a symbol of the clan's unity. When this \\"ancestor\\" is non-human, it is referred to as a totem, which is frequently an animal.  Etymology  The English word \\"clan\\" is derived from the Scottish Gaelic meaning \\"children\\", \\"offspring\\", \\"progeny\\" or \\"descendants\\"; it is not from the word for \\"family\\" or \\"clan\\" in either Irish or Scottish Gaelic. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \\"clan\\" was introduced into English in around 1425, as a descriptive label for the organization of society in the Scottish Highlands. None of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic terms for kinship groups is cognate to English clan; Scottish Gaelic ' means \\"descendants\\": * ' means (English) \\"clan\\" * ' means \\"family\\" in the sense of the nuclear family, or can include more distant relatives living in the same house * ' means either \\"family\\" in the sense of \\"household\\", or everyone who lives in the house, including non- relatives * ' means \\"family\\" in the broad sense of \\"kinsfolk\\"  Clans as political units  In different cultures and situations, a clan usually has different meaning than other kin-based groups, such as tribes and bands. Often, the distinguishing factor is that a clan is a smaller, integral part of a larger society such as a tribe, chiefdom, or a state. In some societies, clans may have an official leader such as a chief, matriarch or patriarch; or such leadership role is performed by elders. In others, leadership positions may have to be achieved. Examples include Irish, Scottish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese clans, which exist as kin groups within their respective nations. Note, however, that tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies. The early Norse clans, the , are often translated as \\"house\\" or \\"line\\". The Biblical tribes of Israel were composed of many clans.See, for example, 1 Chronicles 4 and Numbers 26 in the Old Testament. Arab clans are sub-tribal groups within Arab society. Native American and First Nations peoples, often referred to as \\"tribes\\", also have clans. For instance, Ojibwa bands are smaller parts of the Ojibwa people or tribe in North America. The many Native American peoples are distinguished by language and culture, and most have clans and bands as the basic kinship organizations. In some cases tribes recognized each other's clans; for instance, both the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes of the Southeast United States had fox and bear clans, who felt a kinship that reached beyond their respective tribes. Apart from these different historical traditions of kinship, conceptual confusion arises from colloquial usages of the term. In post-Soviet countries, for example, it is quite common to speak of \\"clans\\" in reference to informal networks within the economic and political sphere. This usage reflects the assumption that their members act towards each other in a particularly close and mutually supportive way, approximating the solidarity among kinsmen. Similar usage of the term applies to specific groups of various cultures and nationalities involved in organized crime. Polish clans differ from most others as they are a collection of families who bear the same coat of arms, as opposed to claiming a common descent (see Polish heraldry).

Flag The \\"Holy See\\" temple in T√¢y Ninh is the centre of the main Caodaist church. Caodaism (, Ch·ªØ n√¥m: ÈÅìÈ´òËá∫) is a monotheistic syncretic religion officially established in the city of T√¢y Ninh in southern Vietnam in 1926. The full name of the religion is ƒê·∫°i ƒê·∫°o Tam K·ª≥ Ph·ªï ƒê·ªô (The Great Faith [for the] Third Universal Redemption). Adherents engage in practices such as prayer, veneration of ancestors, nonviolence, and vegetarianism with the goal of union with God and freedom from sa·πÉsƒÅra. Estimates of the number of Caodaists in Vietnam vary; government figures estimate 4.4 million Caodaists affiliated to the Cao ƒê√†i T√¢y Ninh Holy See, with numbers rising up to 6 million if other branches are added. However estimates vary. The United Nations found about 2.5 million Cao Dai followers in Vietnam as of January 2015. An additional number of adherents in the tens of thousands, primarily ethnic Vietnamese, live in North America, Europe, and Australia. Caodaist temple in Dallas, Texas, serving a large local Vietnamese community. History Ng√¥ VƒÉn Chi√™u, a district head of the French administration in Cochinchina, was the first to worship and receive messages from Cao ƒê√†i in 1921. He received a vision of the Divine Eye which is now the symbol for Cao ƒê√†i as well as the focus for worship on all Cao ƒê√†i altars. Adherents maintain that on Christmas Eve 1925, God identified Himself to the first group of Cao ƒê√†i mediums, which included Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc, Cao Qu·ª≥nh C∆∞, and Cao Ho√†i Sang. These three figures were to play an essential role in the growing religion as the three founding spirit mediums of the Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i or \\"Palace Uniting Heaven and Earth\\". Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc was the head spirit medium or H·ªô Ph√°p (\\"Defender of the Dharma), while Cao Qu·ª≥nh C∆∞ was the Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m (his Sacred Assistant) and Cao Ho√†i Sang was the Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh (his Secular Assistant). On 7 October 1926, L√™ VƒÉn Trung (a former elected official of the Colonial Council of Cochinchina and a member of the Conseil de Gouvernement de l'Indochine), and a leading group of 27 Caodaists, the first disciples of Cao ƒê√†i, signed the \\"Declaration of the Founding of the Cao ƒê√†i Religion\\" and presented it to the French Governor of Cochinchina. The Cao ƒê√†i faith brought together a number of once underground sects into a new national religion. Officially called the \\"Great Way of the Third Time of Redemption\\" (ƒê·∫°i ƒê·∫°o Tam K·ª≥ Ph·ªï ƒê·ªô), it became popular in its first few decades, gathering over a million members and converting a fifth to a fourth of the population of Cochinchina by 1940. Ng√¥ VƒÉn Chi√™u, who had never intended Cao Dai to become a mass organization, left the movement and eventually established in 1932 an independent, esoteric branch known as Chi·∫øu Minh, headquartered in Vƒ©nh Long, which still exists and only admits a limited number of committed adepts. In the 1930s, the leader criticized the French colonial regime, though he also emphasized dialogue with the French. This stance was controversial, and contrasted with the liturgy of dozens of \\"dissident\\" branches of Caodaism that followed a more Taoist model. During the First and Second Indochina Wars, members of Cao ƒê√†i (along with several other Vietnamese sects, such as H√≤a H·∫£o) were active in political and military struggles against both French colonial forces and South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. Their critique of the communist forces until 1975 was a factor in their repression after the fall of Saigon in 1975, when the incoming communist government banned the practice of Caodaism. In 1997, Caodaism was granted legal recognition and unrestricted practice once again. Religious mission Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism are One, a painting in the litang style portraying three men laughing by a river stream. 12th century, Song Dynasty Three Saints and the Divine Covenant The official name of the Cao ƒê√†i religion (or Caodaism) is ƒê·∫°i ƒê·∫°o Tam K·ª≥ Ph·ªï ƒê·ªô. Translated directly it means: The Third Great Universal Religious Amnesty. (ƒê·∫°i ƒê·∫°o ‚Äì \\"Great Faith\\", Tam K·ª≥ ‚Äì \\"Third Period\\", Ph·ªï ‚Äì \\"to announce\\" and ƒê·ªô ‚Äì \\"to save\\"). According to Cao ƒê√†i's dogma, this Third Period will be of intense religious activity which will unite God and humanity in ways not yet imagined. Cao ƒê√†i also states that the Third Amnesty will establish a new great faith for the salvation of living beings before the universal destruction. The primary objective of the Third Amnesty is the unity of all religions, which will bring mankind together in a universal family for universal peace. Caodaism teaches that, throughout human history, God the Father has revealed his truth many times through the mouths of many prophets, but these messages were always either ignored or forgotten due to humanity‚Äôs susceptibility to secular desires. Adherents believe that the age has now come when God speaks to humanity directly. In the nineteenth century, Spiritism became established in Europe. The likes of Madam Blavatsky, Allan Kardec and Victor Hugo championed new religious possibilities. In Vietnam, the age-old traditions of Asian divination and mediumship began to mix with the new traditions of European Spiritism. To highlight this objective of unity, there is a representation of the Divine Covenant of The Third Amnesty (The Third Alliance) inside every Cao ƒê√†i Temple. This Covenant between Heaven and Earth is written and presented to humanity by the Venerable Saints ‚Äì Victor Hugo, Sun Yat Sen and Tr·∫°ng Tr√¨nh Nguy·ªÖn B·ªânh Khi√™m. Their mission is said to guide humanity into the way of the Third Amnesty. The Covenant is written in French: \\"Dieu et Humanit√© Amour et Justice; and in Chinese: Â§©‰∏äÂ§©‰∏ã ÂçöÊÑõÂÖ¨Âπ≥. This translates into English as: \\"God and Humanity [for] Love and Justice.\\" Theology and Theosophy =God= The Eight Trigrams (Bagua, ÂÖ´Âç¶) in Caodaism, borrowed from Taoism \\"Cao ƒê√†i\\" refers to God the Father (the Supreme Being, the Creator, the Ultimate Reality of the Universe). Cao ƒê√†i Ti√™n √îng ƒê·∫°i B·ªì T√°t Ma Ha T√°t, as God's full title, indicates a combination of the three main religions ‚Äì Confucianism, Taoism, and Chinese Buddhism. * Cao ƒê√†i Pronunciation of \\"Cao ƒê√†i\\" in Vietnamese literally means \\"High Tower/Palace\\", that is, the place where God reigns over the universe. These words represent Confucianism. Pronunciation of 'Ti√™n √îng' in Vietnamese * Ti√™n √îng is the largest rank in Taoism. Pronunciation of the third phrase in Vietnamese * ƒê·∫°i B·ªì T√°t Ma Ha T√°t literally means Great Bodhisattva the Great Being (Mahasattva) in Buddhism. Together, they represent not only the unification of the three main religions but also the humility of God who presents himself as the lowest rank of Divinity. =Cosmology= A sphere inside the T√¢y Ninh Holy See, representing the Left Eye of God. Caodaists adopt the traditional Chinese idea of √¢m (yin) and d∆∞∆°ng (yang) duality constituting the harmonious balance of the universe. Before the creation of the universe there was the \\"dao\\", the infinite, nameless, formless, unchanging, eternal source. The negative and positive principles of the universe are the components of the eternal nature. There are two main Gods, the Cao ƒê√†i (\\"Highest Lord\\") and the Di√™u Tr√¨ Kim M·∫´u or ƒê·ª©c Ph·∫≠t M·∫´u (\\"Holy Mother\\"). They represent respectively the yang and yin forces. Cao ƒê√†i is viewed as the heart of the universe, the common Father of all beings. He imparts part of Him into each living being, including even rocks, in the form of consciousness. ƒê·ª©c Ph·∫≠t M·∫´u is venerated as the Mother of the universe, responsible for giving visible forms, consciousness and emotions to all life. Ultimately, She has to follow the orders of \\"ƒê·ª©c Cao ƒê√†i\\", who is revered as the Supreme Being of both Heaven and Earth. All other Divine Beings are to obey the orders of these two Creators during the course of evolution of the universe. Each of them carries a specific role as designated by their Father and Mother. Any being who falls out against them is considered devils in nature. These devils are led by the most powerful being, named Kim Quang S·ª© (Satan). In terms of the cosmos, faithful Caodaists believe there are heaven and hell, which are the main destinations for souls after death. Heaven consists of thirty six planes and many heavenly realms upon each of them, e.g. the Realm of Saints, the Realm of the Holy Mother, the Realm of the Perfect Beings, the Divine Court Realm, The Paradise of Extreme Joy, Nirvana, etc. Meanwhile, hell has ten key realms to carry out punishments in accordance with sins of souls. In order to go to heaven, souls are required to cultivate their virtues and/or devote themselves to spiritual causes. Without merit from the latter, they cannot escape the cycle of birth and death, but can improve their virtues and merit gradually to reach better places in the universe, including the 72 planets (ours is the 68th), the 3,000 worlds, the four great cosmic regions, and the thirty six heavenly planes. True liberation can only be attained when souls reach Nirvana, i.e. the realm of Divine Beings with the most virtues, merits, and wisdom. =Three-fold revelation= The father of the universe, Cao ƒê√†i, is believed to have communed with men since the beginning of times, revealing his will. According to Cao ƒê√†i doctrine, history is divided into three times (tam k·ª≥) of revelation. In the first two periods, there were teachings of Dipankara Buddha, sages, Ph·ª•c Hy, Gautama Buddha, Laozi, Confucius and Jesus, who received the will of the Highest Power, and founded their respective religions to serve and/ or educate humanity. But due to the frailty of the messengers and the common men, the will of the Highest Power was misled into corrupted forms. Caodaists also believe that former revelations were culture-bound, being applicable only for certain ethnicities, and primarily intended for specific ages. The third and final form of revelation is disclosed through the teachings of the Cao ƒê√†i faith. =Twelve- fold hierarchy= Caodaists believe that there are various ranks of divine spirits: Th·∫ßn (\\"angels\\"), Th√°nh (\\"saints\\"), Ti√™n (\\"Immortals\\"), and Ph·∫≠t (\\"Buddhas\\"). Each of these ranks can be further divided in the three grades of Thi√™n (Heavenly), Nh√¢n (Human) and ƒê·ªãa (Earthly), forming a twelve-fold hierarchy that reflects the twelve-fold earthly hierarchy of the Caodaist church. Below those ranks are the spirits of matters, plants, animals and humans. All spirits may evolve to attain higher rank based on present deeds. Disembodied spirits fulfill a number of roles: they are benefactors of mankind, messengers and instructors of the truth. Quan √Çm is regarded as the exemplary goddess of the Buddhas, L√Ω B·∫°ch of the Immortals, and Quan V≈© of the Saints. Unknown to most outsiders, Joan of Arc is worshipped in the Cao ƒê√†i pantheon. She is seen as having guided the Faith at its inception and promoted full equality for women (via s√©ances). The Cao ƒê√†i pantheon also has many other well-known figures, including Muhammad, Moses, Louis Pasteur, Shakespeare, and Lenin. Victor Hugo is probably the most important European figure to play a role in the Caodai pantheon, since he gave many teachings and also the text of a number of important prayers. He himself practiced spiritism on the island of Jersey from 1852 to 1855, and predicted that he would become the prophet of a new religion to merge European and Asian mysticism. Reports that Winston Churchill and Charlie Chaplin were also \\"saints\\" are based on an inaccurate 1956 Time magazine article, since both of them were still alive at the time. Fundamental rules and values The doctrines of the Cao ƒê√†i faith tends not only to reconcile all religious views, but also to adapt itself to all degrees of spiritual evolution. A basic principle of Caodaism is \\"All Religions are One\\". Cao ƒê√†i has been described from five different points of view: # From a moral point of view, Cao ƒê√†i Religion reminds people of their duties towards themselves, their family, their society (a broader family), then toward humanity (the universal family). # From a philosophical point of view, Cao ƒê√†i Religion preaches renunciation of honors, riches and luxury, in other words, deliverance from servitude to materialism in the attainment of full spiritual quietude of soul. # From the point of view of worship, Cao ƒê√†i Religion prescribes the adoration of God, the veneration of Divine Beings and the worship of ancestors. # From a spiritual point of view, Cao ƒê√†i Religion confirms, in harmony with other religions, the existence of the spirits and the soul, their survival beyond the physical body, and their evolution by successive reincarnations, according to the Karmic Law. # From the initiates' point of view, Cao ƒê√†i Religion communicates to worthy adherents and reveals teachings that enable them, by a process of spiritual evolution, to reach the ecstasies of happiness. Worship rituals Believers worship God the Father, Holy Mother and the Divine Beings with all their heart. They also venerate the Great Religious Prophets of history and honour the ancestors. There are four daily ceremonies, that is, at 06:00, Midday, 18:00 and midnight, either at the temple or in front of the home altar. Monthly rituals take place on midnight of the 1st and 15th days of the lunar month. There is also a special anniversary ceremony once a year for God the Father, the Holy Mother, the five founders of the world‚Äôs major religions, and the founders of the Cao Dai religion. The rituals differ between places, depending on who they pray to. * At the Holy See: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer to the Jade Emperor (God the Father), prayer to Dipankara Buddha (Buddhism), prayer to Th√°i Th∆∞·ª£ng L√£o Qu√¢n or Taishang Laojun (Taoism), prayer to Confucius (Confucianism), one of the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges. * At the Holy Mother temple: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer describing the role of the Holy Mother, prayer to express gratitude to the Holy Mother, one the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges. There are also differences between monthly rituals, and anniversary ones. Ceremonial prescriptions such as actions, dress and music were organized in detail by God the Father. These include ceremonies for initiations, marriages and funerals. Particular attention is paid to death, and it has been revealed to the religion how the soul journeys towards heaven and how, on earth, co- religionists can pray for souls to help them on their way. Symbols Cao ƒê√†i temples and religious buildings host a rich array of symbols, all of which are instructed by either God the Father or Divine Beings. No symbol is redundant, and none is meaningless. They each tell a different story that reveals the beliefs, values, cosmic secrets, prophecies, etc. When combined, they lay out the journey of the Tao throughout the history of mankind and the universe, as well as its way forward. =The Divine Eye= In spirit and in pictorial representation, the Eye serves to remind Cao ƒê√†i believers that the God witnesses everything, everywhere, constantly. At the Holy See, there are in total 50 Divine Eyes of five different shapes; each carrying a different meaning related to various spiritual aspects. The One on the globe shows the Supreme Being above the North Star in the Ursa Minor constellation. The One on the fa√ßade of the Holy See has 35 rays of light which represent the three major religions and five main religious doctrines of the world. At the local Cao ƒê√†i Temples, the Divine Eye has 16 rays of light emanating from it. Nine radiate upward representing the nine levels of heaven, and seven radiating downward representing the seven emotions, which believers must control. =The religious banner and emblem= In accordance with the religious mission, the three colors of Cao ƒê√†i banner represent the three main non-Hinduistic Asian religions of the world; yellow stands for Buddhism, blue for Taoism, and red for Confucianism. Under the Divine Eye is the religious emblem which also represents the essence of the three religions; the bowl of charity for Buddhist compassion and asceticism, the feather duster for Taoist purification; the Spring and Autumn Annals for Confucianist virtue and love. Holy scriptures There are various Caodaist scriptures. Some of those belonging to the Holy See of T√¢y Ninh are: Kinh Thi√™n ƒê·∫°o V√† Th·∫ø ƒê·∫°o (\\"Prayers of the Heavenly and the Earthly Way\\"), Ph√°p Ch√°nh Truy·ªÅn (\\"the Religious Constitution of Cao ƒê√†i Religion\\"), T√¢n Lu·∫≠t (\\"The Canonical Codes\\"), and Con ƒê∆∞·ªùng Thi√™ng Li√™ng H·∫±ng S·ªëng (\\"Divine Path to Eternal Life\\"). Other sects have additional scriptures. =The Canonical Codes= This scripture sets out the rules and boundaries for different aspects of the religion, from a believer to the Pope, from education to marriage, etc. There are ten sections in the scripture with the following content: # Hierarchy of religious dignitaries # Initiation and ranks of believers # Establishment of a parish # The five interdictions # The four commandments # Education # Sanctions # Promulgation of laws and regulations # Secular rules # The house of meditation =The Religious Constitution= The Phap-Chanh-Truyen (The Religious Constitution of Caodaism) was delivered to the religion as a series of divine messages. These are the guiding texts of the religion's organisation, stipulating the authority, responsibility, limits, as well as religious vestment for each rank in the religion. Organisational structure Inner hall the T√¢y Ninh Holy See temple. Caodaists worshipping in a temple. Priests are dressed in red, blue and yellow, followers in white. The organisational structure of the Caodaist church has similarities with that of a state. There are similarities between the hierarchy of the Caodaist clergy and that of the Catholic Church. Besides the Pope, the Caodaist hierarchy has Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and further ranks. Caodaism stresses equality among men and women in society. However, in the spiritual domain, ordained women may not attain the two highest positions: the Legislative Cardinal and the Pope. The church claims this is ordered by the Highest Lord, who declared that because D∆∞∆°ng (Yang) represents male and √Çm (Yin) corresponds to female, Yin cannot dominate Yang spiritually or else chaos ensues. The Religion is governed by two powers, the spiritual and earthly ones. The spiritual power (B√°t Qu√°i ƒê√†i): This is the heavenly council, that is, the Spirit and Soul of the New Religion. The council directs all activities of the universe. The council is the invisible part, made up of the Divine Beings, and directed by Duc Cao Dai (God the Father). The Divine Beings represent different religions of the world, including: * Founders of five religions: Shakyamuni (Buddhism), Lao Tze (Taoism), Confucius (Confucianism), Jesus Christ (Christianity), Jiang Ziya (Geniism). * Founders and teachers of Caodaism, who represent the doctrines of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism: Guanyin (Buddhism), Li Bai (Taoism), Guan Yu (Confucianism). The earthly power: To avoid dictatorship, God divided the earthly power into two bodies ‚Äì an Executive Body (C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i) headed by the Pope, and a Legislative Body (Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i) headed by the H·ªô Ph√°p (Protector of Laws and Justice). The former takes charge of the administration of the Religion and its missionary activities, while the latter oversees legislation, jurisdiction and communication with God or Divine Beings. There is also the Charitable Body placed under the supervision of the Legislative Body, and a Lay Committee of selected professional specialists among worthy followers. =The Executive Body (C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i)= The C·ª≠u Tr√πng √ê√†i is the Executive Body of Caodaism which takes charge of the administration of the Religion and missionary activities. Head of C·ª≠u Tr√πng √ê√†i is Gi√°o-T√¥ng (Pope). There are nine ranks in its hierarchy: * One Pope * Three Censor Cardinals * Three Cardinals * Thirty six Archbishops * Seventy two Bishops * Three thousand Priests * Student Priest (no limit) * Subdignitaries (no limit) * Followers (no limit) For male dignitaries of the Executive Body, from the rank of Censor Cardinal to that of Student Priest, each echelon is subdivided into three branches corresponding to the three principal religions: * Buddhist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in yellow. * Taoist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in azure. * Confucianist Branch: These dignitaties are dressed in red. Dignitaries of the same echelon, either Confucianist, Taoist or Buddhist, have the same attributes. At the Holy See, there are three governing councils: * The Popular Council: composed of Student Priests, Sub-dignitaries and representatives of adherents in the ratio of one delegate per 500 members. The Popular Council makes plans for the future. * The Sacerdotal Council: composed of Priests, Bishops, Archbishops and Principal Archbishops. The Sacerdotal Council examines the plans made by the Popular Council. * The High Council: composed of Cardinals, Legislative Body Cardinals and the Pope. All plans made by the Popular Council and favoured by the Sacerdotal Council are submitted to High Council for approval. In addition, there is also a Central Administration body chaired by three Cardinals. Each of them is assisted by three Principal Archbishops to oversee three religious ministries: * The Principal Archbishops of the Buddhist branch take care of finances, supply, and public works. * The Principal Archbishops of the Taoist branch take care of education, health, and agriculture. * The Principal Archbishops of the Confucianist branch take care of interior, rites, and justice. The administrative network which functions throughout Vietnam consists of: * The Religious Region (Tr·∫•n ƒê·∫°o) comprising several provinces, headed by a Bishop who is called the Regional Religious Chief/ Kh√¢m Tr·∫•n ƒê·∫°o. * The Religious Province (Ch√¢u ƒê·∫°o) comprising several districts/delegations, headed by a Priest who is called Provincial Religious Chief/ Kh√¢m Ch√¢u ƒê·∫°o. * The Religious District (H·ªç ƒê·∫°o) comprising several villages, headed by a Student Priest who is called the Religious Chief of Delegation (ƒê·∫ßu T·ªôc ƒê·∫°o/ ƒê·∫ßu H·ªç ƒê·∫°o/ ƒê·∫ßu Ph·∫≠n ƒê·∫°o). * The Religious Village (H∆∞∆°ng ƒê·∫°o) headed by a Sub-dignitary who is called Village Religious Chief (ƒê·∫ßu H∆∞∆°ng ƒê·∫°o). He is assisted by one (or more) Ph√≥ Tr·ªã S·ª± (Deputy Chief for Administration of a religious village) representing the Executive Body and one (or more) Th√¥ng S·ª± representing the Legislative Body. The Religious Village is made up of Religious Hamlets (·∫§p ƒê·∫°o). =The Legislative Body (Hi·ªáp Thi√™n ƒê√†i)= This Body has the duty of communicating with Divine Beings, to preserve the religious laws and listen to the complaints of the unhappy. It is headed by the H·ªô Ph√°p (protector of laws and justice), and assisted by the Th∆∞·ª£ng Ph·∫©m (Director of religious affairs) and Th∆∞·ª£ng Sanh (Director of secular affairs). * H·ªô-Ph√°p (Ë≠∑Ê≥ï) (The head of Legislative Body Affairs), is the one who unveils the Mystery of the Invisible and is the Maintainer of the Rules and Laws of the New Religion. He is the one who pronounces judgments on the dignitaries and adepts, elevates the dignity of the fervent through their merit and brings sanctions against those who have committed faults. The H·ªô- Ph√°p holds control over the Legislative Body Power both exoterically and esoterically. He watches over the positive progress of the disciples in the Way of God, and guides all evolved souls to B√°t-Qu√°i-ƒê√†i for the union with Angels, Saints, Immortals and Buddhas. * Th∆∞·ª£ng-Ph·∫©m (‰∏äÂìÅ) (The head of Religious Affairs), is the Representative of the Ho-Phap in the formation of virtuous souls of the Sacerdotal Council. He depends on the H·ªô-Ph√°p in all his missions. In a word, the Th∆∞·ª£ng-Ph·∫©m helps the C·ª≠u Tr√πng ƒê√†i to live in an atmosphere of happiness; he reveals the Heavenly Voice to virtuous souls, and guides them to the Divine Phase of the Great Spirits, while closing behind them the door of regression. He considers the priestly laws to take up the defence of all office-bearers and adepts; he prevents all perversion of the Divine Rules, and helps all initiates to attain their aim. He is simultaneously the President of the Hall of Defence and protector of all disciples. The Th∆∞·ª£ng-Ph·∫©m is \\"Leader of the Spiritual Power\\". * Th∆∞·ª£ng‚ÄìSanh (‰∏äÁîü) (The head of Secular Affairs), has control of all the laws and rules which relate to the worldly life of all adepts to guide them out of the sea of sufferings. He may present a formal complaint before the religious Tribunal against all those who impede the faithful as they move along the Way of God. He is the President of the Hall of Accusation. Four \\"zodiacal dignitaries\\" under each of these branches carry the four key responsibilities of conservation, renovation, reformation, and legislation. They are further assisted by twelve technical academicians, including B·∫£o Huy·ªÅn Linh Qu√¢n (Theosophy), B·∫£o Tinh Qu√¢n (Astronomy), B·∫£o C√¥ Qu√¢n (Orphanage), B·∫£o VƒÉn ph√°p qu√¢n (Culture), B·∫£o H·ªçc Qu√¢n (Education), B·∫£o Y Qu√¢n (Health), B·∫£o V·∫≠t Qu√¢n (Science and Industry, B·∫£o Sƒ© Qu√¢n (Literature), B·∫£o Sanh Qu√¢n (Social work), B·∫£o N√¥ng Qu√¢n (Agriculture), B·∫£o C√¥ng Qu√¢n (Public Works), B·∫£o Th∆∞∆°ng Qu√¢n (Economics). Community structure Any local area having more than 500 believers is authorized to establish a Parish (H·ªç ƒê·∫°o/ T·ªôc ƒê·∫°o) with a Th√°nh- Th·∫•t (Temple, Church, Holy House) which is led by the authority of a dignitary. Parish/Parishes can be established only with the permission and authority of the Giao-Tong/ Pope. Twice a month, the first and the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, the believers must meet at the Th√°nh-Th·∫•t (Temple, Holy House) of the local area to attend the ceremony and listen to the teachings. Exception can be made for those with reasonable excuses The Holy See Ninety kilometres north-west of Saigon in T√¢y-Ninh Province is the Caodaist Holy See. At the centre of this city stands the Great Divine Temple. This temple, like the religion, is a fusion of world influences. As well as being a major centre of pilgrimage, the Caodaist Holy See is also one of Vietnam's major tourist attractions. Branches ‚ÄúThe period between 1934 and 1975 witnessed not only the robust development of the Cao Dai religion but also saw the separation of the Cao Dai religion into different independent sects, sometimes as many as 30\\" As of July 2014, \\"central and provincial authorities have granted legal recognition\\" to 11 Cao Dai sects. These sects generally divide along geographic lines. The largest is based in T√¢y Ninh Province, where the religion was founded in 1926 and where the seat of the Caodaist authority is located. The Caodaist Executive Council of T√¢y Ninh Province received official government recognition in 1997. Independent Caodaist groups allege that government interference has undermined the independence of the T√¢y Ninh group, and it no longer faithfully upholds Cao ƒê√†i's principles and traditions. Religious training takes place at individual temples rather than at centralized seminaries.

He was one of an established family of stage magicians, the son of Nevil Maskelyne and a grandson of John Nevil Maskelyne. He is most remembered, however, for his entertaining accounts of his work for British military intelligence during the Second World War, in which he claims that he created large-scale ruses, deception, and camouflage in an effort to defeat the Nazi regime. Early life Maskelyne was born in Wandsworth, London, England in 1902, to magician Nevil Maskelyne and his wife Ada Mary Ardley. Career =Stage magician= Maskelyne was a successful stage magician. His 1936 Book of Magic describes a range of stage tricks, including sleight of hand, card and rope tricks, and illusions of \\"mind-reading\\". A 1937 Path√© film, The Famous Illusionist, was made of Maskelyne, looking dapper and apparently eating a boxful of razor blades, one at a time. =Wartime service= Sherman tank, one of many deceptions that Maskelyne claimed to have created Maskelyne entertains Indian Army officers and civilian VIP's being at Mena House in Cairo, 19 April 1942. Maskelyne joined the Royal Engineers when the Second World War broke out, thinking that his skills could be used in camouflage. A story runs that he convinced skeptical officers by creating the illusion of a German warship on the Thames using mirrors and a model. Maskelyne was trained at the Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle in 1940. He found the training boring, asserting in his book that \\"a lifetime of hiding things on the stage\\" had taught him more about camouflage \\"than rabbits and tigers will ever know\\". The camoufleur Julian Trevelyan commented that he \\"entertained us with his tricks in the evenings\\" at Farnham, but that Maskelyne was \\"rather unsuccessful\\" at actually camouflaging \\"concrete pill-boxes\\". Brigadier Dudley Clarke, the head of the 'A' Force deception department, recruited Maskelyne to work for MI9 in Cairo. He created small devices intended to assist soldiers to escape if captured and lectured on escape techniques. These included tools hidden in cricket bats, saw blades inside combs, and small maps on objects such as playing cards. Maskelyne was then briefly a member of Geoffrey Barkas's camouflage unit at Helwan, near Cairo, which was set up in November 1941. He was made head of the subsidiary \\"Camouflage Experimental Section\\" at Abbassia. By February 1942 it became clear that this command was not successful, and so he was \\"transferred to welfare\\"--in other words, to entertaining soldiers with magic tricks. Peter Forbes writes that the \\"flamboyant\\" magician's contribution was His nature was \\"to perpetuate the myth of his own inventive genius, and perhaps he even believed it himself\\". However, Clarke had encouraged Maskelyne to take credit for two reasons: as cover for the true inventors of the dummy machinery and to encourage confidence in these techniques amongst Allied high command. Maskelyne's book about his exploits, Magic: Top Secret, ghost-written, was published in 1949. Forbes describes it as lurid, with \\"extravagant claims of cities disappearing, armies re-locating, dummies proliferating (even submarines)--all as a result of his knowledge of the magic arts\\". Further, Forbes notes, the biography of Maskelyne by David Fisher was \\"clearly under the wizard's spell\\". In his book, Maskelyne claims his team produced Jasper Maskelyne and his magic troupe departing from Nairobi in 1950. Jasper Maskelyne is on the right, touching the arm of Yvonne Helliwell, his stage assistant. Doubts raised A study by Richard Stokes argues that much of the story concerning the involvement of Maskelyne in counterintelligence operations as described in the book Magic: Top Secret was pure invention and that no unit called the \\"Magic Gang\\" ever existed. Maskelyne's role in the deception war was marginal.In a series of twenty-one articles published between November 1997 and October 2005 in the magazine Genii Magic Journal (Sydney, Australia), magician Richard Stokes criticizes The War Magician, contextualizing David Fisher‚Äôs account within contemporary literary and military sources and with reference to the recollections of Jasper Maskelyne‚Äôs surviving son, Alistair Maskelyne. Christian House, reviewing Rick Stroud's book The Phantom Army of Alamein in The Independent, describes Maskelyne as \\"one of the more grandiose members\\" of the Second World War desert camouflage unit and \\"a chancer tasked with experimental developments, who fogged his own reputation as much as any desert convoy\\". David Hambling, writing on Wired, critiques David Fisher's uncritical acceptance of Maskelyne's stories: \\"A very colourful account of Maskelyne's role is given in the book The War Magician‚Äîreading it you might think he won the war single-handed\\". Hambling denies Maskelyne's supposed concealment of the Suez Canal: \\"[I]n spite of the book's claims, the dazzle light[s] were never actually built (although a prototype was once tested)\\". In the book on WW2 deception, Ghosts of the ETO by Jonathan Gawne it was explained how Maskelyne was not responsible for all the deception work that was claimed and that Dudley Clarke deserves the lion share of any credit. The film director Peter Weir with actor Tom Cruise was working on a film based on the life of Jasper Maskelyne starting in 2003. When it became apparent that the stories about Maskelyne in the book \\"The War Magician\\" were without enough factual basis to proceed, the film project was dropped after large sums of money had been spent in pre-production. The story continues to attract attention as a movie subject. In 2015 Benedict Cumberbatch was reported as signing on to play the role, provided a director could be found.https://variety.com/2015/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-the- war-magician-1201656495/ Variety In 2002 The Guardian wrote: \\"Maskelyne received no official recognition. For a vain man this was intolerable and he died an embittered drunk. It gives his story a poignancy without which it would be mere chest-beating\\".

It is the capital of Al Anbar Governorate. The city extends along the Euphrates and is the largest city in Al-Anbar. Founded by the Ottoman Empire in 1879, by 2018 it had a population of about 223,500 people, the vast majority of whom are Sunni Arabs from the Dulaim tribal confederation. It lies within the Sunni Triangle of western Iraq. Ramadi occupies a highly strategic location on the Euphrates and the road west into Syria and Jordan. This has made it a hub for trade and traffic, from which the city gained significant prosperity. Its position has meant that it has been fought over several times, during the two World Wars and again during the Iraq War and Iraqi insurgency. It was heavily damaged during the Iraq War, when it was a major focus for the insurgency against occupying United States forces. Following the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in 2011, the city was contested by the Iraqi government and the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and fell to ISIL in May 2015. On 28 December 2015, the Iraqi government declared that it had re-taken Ramadi from ISIL, that government's first major military victory since the loss of Ramadi some seven months earlier. Population and demography Ramadi's population was reported by the World Food Programme to number 375,000 people in 2011,http://www.citypopulation.de/Iraq.html#Stadt-alpha though the number is likely to have decreased since then given the impact of the Iraq war and insurgency. Its population grew rapidly during the last half of the 20th century, from 12,020 people in 1956 to 192,556 in 1987. The population is very homogeneous, over 90 per cent Sunni Arab. The vast majority of its population come from the Dulaim tribal confederation, which inhabits Syria and Jordan as well as Iraq and has over a thousand individual clans, each headed by a sheik selected by tribal elders. History Ramadi is located in a fertile, irrigated, alluvial plain, within Iraq's Sunni Triangle. A settlement already existed in the area when the British explorer Francis Rawdon Chesney passed through in 1836 on a steam-powered boat during an expedition to test the navigability of the Euphrates. He described it as a \\"pretty little town\\" and noted that the black tents of the Bedouin could be seen along the both banks of the river all the way from Ramadi to Falujah. The modern city was founded in 1869 by Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman Wali (Governor) of Baghdad. The Ottomans sought to control the previously nomadic Dulaim tribe in the region as part of a programme of settling the Bedouin tribes of Iraq through the use of land grants, in the belief that this would bind them more closely to the state and make them easier to control. Ramadi Mosque 2004 Ramadi was described in 1892 as \\"the most wide awake town in the whole Euphrates valley. It has a telegraph office and large government barracks. The bazaars are very large and well filled.\\" Sir John Bagot Glubb (\\"Glubb Pasha\\") was posted there in 1922 \\"to maintain a rickety floating bridge over the river [Euphrates], carried on boats made of reeds daubed with bitumen\\", as he put it. By this time the Dulaim were mostly settled, though they had not yet fully adopted an urbanised lifestyle. Glubb described them as \\"cultivators along the banks of the Euphrates, watering their wheat, barley and date palms by kerids, or water lifts worked by horses. Yet they had but recently settled, and still lived in black goat-hair tents.\\" A British military handbook published during World War I noted that \\"some European travellers have found the inhabitants of Rumadiyah [Ramadi] inclined to fanaticism\\". =World Wars I and II= Ramadi was twice fought over during the Mesopotamian Campaign of World War I. It was held initially by the forces of the Ottoman Empire, which garrisoned it in March 1917 after losing control of Fallujah to the east. The British Army's Lieutenant General Frederick Stanley Maude sought to drive out the garrison in July 1917 but faced severe difficulties due to exceptional heat during both day and night. A force of around 600 British soldiers plus cavalry units faced 1,000 Turks with six artillery pieces. The attack was a costly failure and a combination of exhaustion, disorganisation, Turkish artillery fire and an unexpected sandstorm forced Maude to call off the attack with heavy losses. More than half of the 566 British casualties were caused by the heat. Maude tried again during a cooler period in September 1917. This time the attacking force, led by Major General H.T. Brookings, was better organised and the British force was able to cope with the temperatures. The British mounted their attack from a direction that the Turks had not expected and managed to cut off their enemy's line of retreat. Many members of the Turkish garrison were killed or forced to surrender and the British were able to take control of Ramadi. Ramadi was contested again during World War II following the 1941 Iraqi coup d'√©tat. The coup leader, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, initiated a siege of the British base at RAF Habbaniya near Ramadi. This prompted a British counter-attack to break the siege, sparking the brief Anglo-Iraqi War. An Iraqi brigade occupied Ramadi under the auspices of a training exercise. The British assembled an ad hoc relief force dubbed Habforce which advanced from the British Mandate of Palestine into Iraq. The force succeeded in relieving RAF Habbaniya and Iraqi resistance rapidly crumbled as their counter-attacks were defeated, allowing a British column to seize control of Ramadi. =Post- war= The Ramadi Barrage was built near the city in 1955 to feed water into Lake Habbaniyah to the southeast. The University of Anbar was founded there in 1987 and, together with Ramadi's trade and transport links, gave the city a more cosmopolitan, liberal and secular culture than others in the Sunni Triangle. Many high-ranking officials of the ruling Ba'ath Party came from Ramadi. Its local elites were also closely tied to the regime. The Anbar tribes in and around the city were largely co-opted to support the regime and Ramadi was the home base of the Iraqi Army's combat engineers, special forces and many active and retired senior officers.Fitzsimmons (2013), p. 23 Ramadi was the scene of large-scale demonstrations against Saddam Hussein in 1995. This made it virtually unique in Sunni Iraq, where support for Saddam was strongest.Fitzsimmons (2013), p. 22 The demonstrations were prompted by Saddam's execution of a prominent member of the Dulaim tribe from Ramadi, Iraqi Air Force General Muhammad Madhlum al-Dulaimi, and three other Dulaimi officers. The four had criticized the regime and Saddam's notoriously violent and dissolute son Uday. After their execution, the bodies were sent back to Ramadi. The regime's security forces put down the demonstrations which ensued and Saddam subsequently viewed the Dulaimis with suspicion, though he was unable to purge them without risking a full-scale tribal revolt. =Iraq War and Iraqi insurgency= Iraqi police review in front of the government headquarters in Ramadi, 2007 The policy of de-Ba'athification and the disbandment of the Iraqi Army, implemented by the United States following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, hit Ramadi particularly hard because of its links to the party and the army. Many senior officials and military figures in the city suddenly found themselves excluded from public life. This gave them both the motivation and the means, given their connections and technical expertise, to mount a campaign of violence against coalition forces. As a result, Ramadi became a hotbed of insurgency between 2003 and 2006 and was badly affected by the Iraq War. =ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham)= Following the withdrawal of US and Coalition forces in 2011, Ramadi was contested by Iraq and the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) during the ongoing Iraqi insurgency. On 15 May 2015 Ramadi was captured by ISIS after an assault that included suicide car bombs, mortars, and rocket launchers. CNN reported that ISIS took over 50 high-level security personnel prisoners during the assault. The ISIS flag was also raised at the Ramadi government headquarters. By 17 May 2015 Ramadi had been completely captured by ISIS forces. Since the ISIS occupation of Ramadi, efforts have been made to re-take the city. In November 2015, Iraqi government forces completed an encirclement of Ramadi. On 28 December, Iraqi forces advanced into the centre of the city of Ramadi and liberated it. =Iraq's recapture of the city= On 28 December 2015, Iraq's government claimed that it retook the city from the Islamic insurgency group ISIS. The operation started in early November. The city's recapture is seen as a major reversal for ISIS. ISIS occupied the city beginning in May 2015. The ISIS occupation of the city was a major defeat for the Iraqi government forces. The recapture of Ramadi was backed by US-led coalition air strikes, but made slow progress, mainly because the government chose not to use the powerful Shia-dominated paramilitary force that had previously helped it regain the mainly Sunni northern city of Tikrit, to avoid increasing sectarian tensions. The military said remaining ISIS militants have headed out to the north-east of Ramadi. The PM of Iraq declared that 30 December as celebrations of the recapture of Ramadi. However, Ramadi was highly damaged afterwards, with some estimates as high as 90%. Transportation Ramadi dam, known as Al Jazeera bridge Ramadi stands on an important trade route leading across the desert to Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.\\"Al-RamƒÅdƒ´.\\" Britannica School. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Inc., 2015. Web. 18 May. 2015. The main Amman‚ÄìBaghdad road passes through the city. A railway line also runs through the southern outskirts of Ramadi, heading east to Baghdad and west to Haditha and the Syrian border. Geography Map of Ramadi in 2003 At the start of the 21st century, Ramadi stretched over an area of about east to west by north to south. The center of the city is densely built up, with numerous more spread- out residential suburbs surrounding it. The city center is bounded to the north by the Euphrates, to the east by suburbs, to the south by the railway line between Baghdad and Haditha, and to the west by the Habbaniyah Canal. More suburbs exist to the west and northwest of the canal and north of the Euphrates. The city center is connected to the suburbs by two major bridges, one across the Euphrates and the other across the canal, while the western and northern suburbs are connected by a major highway that crosses the Euphrates north of the city. Various tribal groups live in separate districts within the suburbs, with dozens of sheikhs being responsible for maintaining the security and well-being of their particular grouping.DiMarco (2012), p. 192 The suburbs are extensively criss-crossed with canals that are used to irrigate the farmland around the city. Ramadi's recent origins mean that it is dominated by modern concrete buildings, mostly flat-roofed two- or three-story structures but with a number of taller buildings in the city center. Its modern origins mean that it lacks features typical of older Iraqi cities, such as a kasbah. The Japanese-built city hospital, with seven stories, is the tallest building in Ramadi. The city was badly damaged during the Iraq war and insurgency. Many buildings were destroyed and many more were rendered uninhabitable.DiMarco (2012), p. 191 Climate Ramadi has a hot desert climate (BWh) in the K√∂ppen‚ÄìGeiger climate classification system. Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Ramadi is . About of precipitation falls annually. Sand storms often occur during in the warmer months in this region.

It is defined by the integral : \\\\Beta(x,y) = \\\\int_0^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}\\\\,dt for complex number inputs such that . The beta function was studied by Euler and Legendre and was given its name by Jacques Binet; its symbol is a Greek capital beta.  Properties  The beta function is symmetric, meaning that : \\\\Beta(x,y) = \\\\Beta(y,x) for all inputs and .Davis (1972) 6.2.2 p.258 A key property of the beta function is its close relationship to the gamma function: one has that : \\\\Beta(x,y)=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(x)\\\\,\\\\Gamma(y)}{\\\\Gamma(x+y)}. (A proof is given below in .) The beta function is also closely related to binomial coefficients. When and are positive integers, it follows from the definition of the gamma function thatDavis (1972) 6.2.1 p.258 : \\\\Beta(x,y) =\\\\dfrac{(x-1)!\\\\,(y-1)!}{(x+y-1)!} = \\\\frac{x + y}{xy} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\binom{x + y}{x}}.  Relationship to the gamma function  A simple derivation of the relation \\\\Beta(x,y)=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(x)\\\\,\\\\Gamma(y)}{\\\\Gamma(x+y)} can be found in Emil Artin's book The Gamma Function, page 18‚Äì19. To derive this relation, write the product of two factorials as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma(x)\\\\Gamma(y) &= \\\\int_{u=0}^\\\\infty\\\\ e^{-u} u^{x-1}\\\\,du \\\\cdot\\\\int_{v=0}^\\\\infty\\\\ e^{-v} v^{y-1}\\\\,dv \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &=\\\\int_{v=0}^\\\\infty\\\\int_{u=0}^\\\\infty\\\\ e^{-u-v} u^{x-1}v^{y-1}\\\\, du \\\\,dv. \\\\end{align} Changing variables by and produces :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Gamma(x)\\\\Gamma(y) &= \\\\int_{z=0}^\\\\infty\\\\int_{t=0}^1 e^{-z} (zt)^{x-1}(z(1-t))^{y-1}z\\\\,dt \\\\,dz \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_{z=0}^\\\\infty e^{-z}z^{x+y-1} \\\\,dz\\\\cdot\\\\int_{t=0}^1 t^{x-1}(1-t)^{y-1}\\\\,dt\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\Gamma(x+y) \\\\cdot \\\\Beta(x,y). \\\\end{align} Dividing both sides by \\\\Gamma(x+y) gives the desired result. The stated identity may be seen as a particular case of the identity for the integral of a convolution. Taking :\\\\begin{align}f(u)&:=e^{-u} u^{x-1} 1_{\\\\R_+} \\\\\\\\\\\\ g(u)&:=e^{-u} u^{y-1} 1_{\\\\R_+}, \\\\end{align} one has: : \\\\Gamma(x) \\\\Gamma(y) = \\\\int_{\\\\R}f(u)\\\\,du\\\\cdot \\\\int_{\\\\R} g(u) \\\\,du = \\\\int_{\\\\R}(f*g)(u)\\\\,du =\\\\Beta(x, y)\\\\,\\\\Gamma(x+y).

Approximation Stirling's approximation gives the asymptotic formula :\\\\Beta(x,y) \\\\sim \\\\sqrt {2\\\\pi } \\\\frac{x^{x - 1/2} y^{y - 1/2} }{( {x + y} )^{x + y - 1/2} } for large and large . If on the other hand is large and is fixed, then :\\\\Beta(x,y) \\\\sim \\\\Gamma(y)\\\\,x^{-y}.  Other identities and formulas  The integral defining the beta function may be rewritten in a variety of ways, including the following: \\\\begin{align} \\\\Beta(x,y) &= 2\\\\int_0^{\\\\pi / 2}(\\\\sin\\\\theta)^{2x-1}(\\\\cos\\\\theta)^{2y-1}\\\\,d\\\\theta, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= \\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\frac{t^{x-1}}{(1+t)^{x+y}}\\\\,dt, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] &= n\\\\int_0^1t^{nx-1}(1-t^n)^{y-1}\\\\,dt, \\\\end{align} where in the last identity is any positive real number. (One may move from the first integral to the second one by substituting t = tan^2(\\\\theta).) The beta function can be written as an infinite sum : \\\\Beta(x,y) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac\\\\binom{n-y}{n} {x+n} and as an infinite product : \\\\Beta(x,y) = \\\\frac{x+y}{x y} \\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left( 1+ \\\\dfrac{x y}{n (x+y+n)}\\\\right)^{-1}. The beta function satisfies several identities analogous to corresponding identities for binomial coefficients, including a version of Pascal's identity \\\\Beta(x,y) = \\\\Beta(x, y+1) + \\\\Beta(x+1, y) and a simple recurrence on one coordinate: \\\\Beta(x+1,y) = \\\\Beta(x, y) \\\\cdot \\\\dfrac{x}{x+y}, \\\\quad \\\\Beta(x,y+1) = \\\\Beta(x, y) \\\\cdot \\\\dfrac{y}{x+y}. For x, y \\\\geq 1, the beta function may be written in terms of a convolution involving the truncated power function : \\\\Beta(x,y) \\\\cdot\\\\left(t \\\\mapsto t_+^{x+y-1}\\\\right) = \\\\Big(t \\\\mapsto t_+^{x-1}\\\\Big) * \\\\Big(t \\\\mapsto t_+^{y-1}\\\\Big) Evaluations at particular points may simplify significantly; for example, \\\\Beta(1,x) = \\\\dfrac{1}{x} and \\\\Beta(x,1-x) = \\\\dfrac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sin(\\\\pi x)}, \\\\qquad x ot \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z} By taking x = \\\\frac{1}{2} in this last formula, one may conclude in particular that . One may also generalize the last formula into a bivariate identity for a product of beta functions: \\\\Beta(x,y) \\\\cdot \\\\Beta(x+y,1-y) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{x \\\\sin(\\\\pi y)} . Euler's integral for the beta function may be converted into an integral over the Pochhammer contour as :\\\\left(1-e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\alpha}\\\\right)\\\\left(1-e^{2\\\\pi i\\\\beta}\\\\right)\\\\Beta(\\\\alpha,\\\\beta) =\\\\int_C t^{\\\\alpha-1}(1-t)^{\\\\beta-1} \\\\, dt. This Pochhammer contour integral converges for all values of and and so gives the analytic continuation of the beta function. Just as the gamma function for integers describes factorials, the beta function can define a binomial coefficient after adjusting indices: :\\\\binom{n}{k} = \\\\frac{1}{(n+1) \\\\Beta(n-k+1, k+1)}. Moreover, for integer , can be factored to give a closed form interpolation function for continuous values of : :\\\\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^n\\\\, n! \\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\sin (\\\\pi k)}{\\\\pi \\\\displaystyle\\\\prod_{i=0}^n (k-i)}. The beta function was the first known scattering amplitude in string theory, first conjectured by Gabriele Veneziano. It also occurs in the theory of the preferential attachment process, a type of stochastic urn process. Reciprocal beta function The reciprocal beta function is the function about the form :f(z)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Beta(x,y)} Interestingly, their integral representations closely relate as the definite integral of trigonometric functions with product of its power and multiple-angle: :\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\sin^{x-1}\\\\theta\\\\sin y\\\\theta~d\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\sin\\\\frac{y\\\\pi}{2}}{2^{x-1}x\\\\Beta\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+y+1}{2},\\\\frac{x-y+1}{2}\\\\right)} :\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\sin^{x-1}\\\\theta\\\\cos y\\\\theta~d\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\cos\\\\frac{y\\\\pi}{2}}{2^{x-1}x\\\\Beta\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+y+1}{2},\\\\frac{x-y+1}{2}\\\\right)} :\\\\int_0^\\\\pi\\\\cos^{x-1}\\\\theta\\\\sin y\\\\theta~d\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\pi\\\\cos\\\\frac{y\\\\pi}{2}}{2^{x-1}x\\\\Beta\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+y+1}{2},\\\\frac{x-y+1}{2}\\\\right)} :\\\\int_0^\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\cos^{x-1}\\\\theta\\\\cos y\\\\theta~d\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2^xx\\\\Beta\\\\left(\\\\frac{x+y+1}{2},\\\\frac{x-y+1}{2}\\\\right)} Incomplete beta function The incomplete beta function, a generalization of the beta function, is defined as : \\\\Beta(x;\\\\,a,b) = \\\\int_0^x t^{a-1}\\\\,(1-t)^{b-1}\\\\,dt. For , the incomplete beta function coincides with the complete beta function. The relationship between the two functions is like that between the gamma function and its generalization the incomplete gamma function. The regularized incomplete beta function (or regularized beta function for short) is defined in terms of the incomplete beta function and the complete beta function: : I_x(a,b) = \\\\frac{\\\\Beta(x;\\\\,a,b)}{\\\\Beta(a,b)}. The regularized incomplete beta function is the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution, and is related to the cumulative distribution function F(k;\\\\,n,p) of a random variable following a binomial distribution with probability of single success and number of Bernoulli trials : :F(k;\\\\,n,p) = \\\\Pr\\\\left(X \\\\le k\\\\right) = I_{1-p}(n-k, k+1) = 1 - I_p(k+1,n-k). =Properties= :\\\\begin{align} I_0(a,b) &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_1(a,b) &= 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x(a,1) &= x^a\\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x(1,b) &= 1 - (1-x)^b \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x(a,b) &= 1 - I_{1-x}(b,a) \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x(a+1,b) &= I_x(a,b)-\\\\frac{x^a(1-x)^b}{a \\\\Beta(a,b)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_x(a,b+1) &= I_x(a,b)+\\\\frac{x^a(1-x)^b}{b \\\\Beta(a,b)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Beta(x;a,b)&=(-1)^{a} \\\\Beta\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{x-1};a,1-a-b\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Multivariate beta function The beta function can be extended to a function with more than two arguments: :\\\\Beta(\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2,\\\\ldots\\\\alpha_n) = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1)\\\\,\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_2) \\\\cdots \\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_n)}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\alpha_n)} . This multivariate beta function is used in the definition of the Dirichlet distribution. Its relationship to the beta function is analogous to the relationship between multinomial coefficients and binomial coefficients. Software implementation Even if unavailable directly, the complete and incomplete beta function values can be calculated using functions commonly included in spreadsheet or computer algebra systems. In Excel, for example, the complete beta value can be calculated from the \`GammaLn\` function: :\`Value = Exp(GammaLn(a) + GammaLn(b) ‚àí GammaLn(a + b))\` An incomplete beta value can be calculated as: :\`Value = BetaDist(x, a, b) * Exp(GammaLn(a) + GammaLn(b) ‚àí GammaLn(a + b))\`. These result follow from the properties listed above. Similarly, \`betainc\` (incomplete beta function) in MATLAB and GNU Octave, \`pbeta\` (probability of beta distribution) in R, or \`special.betainc\` in Python's SciPy package compute the regularized incomplete beta function‚Äîwhich is, in fact, the cumulative beta distribution‚Äîand so, to get the actual incomplete beta function, one must multiply the result of \`betainc\` by the result returned by the corresponding \`beta\` function. In Mathematica, \`Beta[x, a, b]\` and \`BetaRegularized[x, a, b]\` give \\\\Beta(x;\\\\,a,b) and I_x(a,b) , respectively.

He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomu≈Çka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \\"Polish way to socialism\\"; and giving rise to the period known as \\"Gomu≈Çka's thaw\\". During the 1960s, however, he became more rigid and authoritarian‚Äîafraid of destabilizing the system, he was not inclined to introduce or permit changes. In the 1960s he supported the persecution of the Catholic Church, intellectuals and the anti-communist opposition. In 1967‚Äì68 Gomu≈Çka allowed outbursts of \\"anti-Zionist\\" political propaganda,Judt, Tony (2005). Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945. New York, The Penguin Press, pp. 434‚Äì35 which turned into an anti-Semitic campaign, pursued primarily by others in the Party, but utilized by Gomu≈Çka to retain power by shifting the attention from the stagnating economy. Many of the remaining Polish Jews left the country. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media. Gomu≈Çka supported Poland's participation in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. In the treaty with West Germany, signed in December 1970 at the end of Gomu≈Çka's period in office, Germany recognized the post-World War II borders, which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in Central Europe. In the same month, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent bloody clashes with shipyard workers on the Baltic coast, in which several dozen workers were fatally shot. The tragic events forced Gomu≈Çka's resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, Edward Gierek took over the Party leadership and tensions eased. Childhood and education W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka was born on 6 February 1905 in Bia≈Çobrzegi Franciszka≈Ñskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker's family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had emigrated in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because W≈Çadys≈Çaw's father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomu≈Çka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. W≈Çadys≈Çaw's older sister J√≥zefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. W≈Çadys≈Çaw and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. W≈Çadys≈Çaw received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region. Gomu≈Çka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen, when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomu≈Çka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor. In 1922, Gomu≈Çka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery. Early revolutionary activities =Involvement with labor unions and first imprisonment= The re-established Polish state of Gomu≈Çka's teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the Si≈Ça (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomu≈Çka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomu≈Çka was for the first time arrested, but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomu≈Çka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist- dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian. In late 1926, while in Drohobych, Gomu≈Çka became a member of the illegal-but-functioning Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP) and was arrested for political agitation. Technically, at this time he was a member of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, which was an autonomous branch of the Communist Party of Poland. He was interested primarily in social issues, including the trade and labor movement, and concentrated on practical activities. In mid-1927, Gomu≈Çka was brought to Warsaw, where he remained active until drafted for military service at the end of the year. After several months, the military released him because of a health problem with his right leg. Gomu≈Çka returned to communist party work, organizing strike actions and speaking at gatherings of workers at all major industrial centers of Poland. During this period he was arrested several times and lived under police supervision. Gomu≈Çka was an activist in the leftist labor unions from 1926 and in the Central Trade Department of the KPP Central Committee from 1931. In the summer of 1930, Gomu≈Çka illegally embarked on his first foreign trip with the intention of participating in the Red International of Labor Unions Fifth Congress held in Moscow from 15 to 30 July. Traveling from Upper Silesia to Berlin, he had to wait there for the issuance of Soviet documents and arrived in Moscow too late participate in the deliberations of the Congress. He stayed in Moscow for a couple of weeks and then went to Leningrad, from where he took a ship to Hamburg, stayed in Berlin again and through Silesia returned to Poland. In August 1932, he was arrested by the Sanation police while participating in a conference of textile worker delegates in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. When he later tried to escape, Gomu≈Çka sustained a gunshot wound in the left thigh which ultimately left him with a permanent walking impairment. =Journey to the Soviet Union and second imprisonment= Despite being sentenced to a four-year prison term on 1 June 1933, he was temporarily released for surgery on his injured leg in March 1934. Following his release, Gomu≈Çka requested that the KPP send him to the Soviet Union for medical treatment and further political training. He arrived in the Soviet Union in June and went to the Crimea for several weeks, where he underwent therapeutic baths. Gomu≈Çka then spent more than a year in Moscow, where he attended the Lenin School under the name Stefan Kowalski. The ideology-oriented classes were arranged separately for a small group of Polish students (one of them was Roman Romkowski (Natan Gr√ºnspan [Grinszpan]-Kikiel), who would later persecute Gomu≈Çka in Stalinist Poland) and included a military training course conducted by Karol ≈öwierczewski. In a written opinion issued by the school Gomu≈Çka was characterized in highly positive terms, but his extended stay in the Soviet Union caused him to become disillusioned with the realities of Stalinist communism and highly critical of the agrarian collectivization practice. In November 1935 he illegally returned to Poland. Gomu≈Çka resumed his communist and labor conspiratorial activities and kept advancing within the KPP organization until, as the secretary of the Party's Silesian branch, he was arrested in Chorz√≥w in April 1936. He was then tried by the District Court in Katowice and sentenced to seven years in prison where he remained jailed until the beginning of World War II. Ironically, this internment most likely saved Gomu≈Çka's life, because the majority of the KPP leadership would be murdered in the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, caught up in the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin's orders. Gomu≈Çka's experiences turned him into an extremely suspicious and distrustful person and contributed to his lifelong conviction that Sanation Poland was a fascist state, even if Polish prisons were the most safe places for Polish Communists.[Caviar and Ashes: A Warsaw Generation's Life and Death in Marxism, 1918‚Äì1968, p. 149] He differentiated this belief from his positive feelings toward the country and its people, especially members of the working class. World War II =Invasion of Poland= The outbreak of the war with Nazi Germany freed Gomu≈Çka from his prison confinement. On 7 September 1939 he arrived in Warsaw, where he stayed for a few weeks, working in the besieged capital on the construction of defensive fortifications. From there, like many other Polish communists, Gomu≈Çka fled to eastern Poland which was invaded by the Soviet Union on 17 September 1939. In Bia≈Çystok he ran a home for former political prisoners arriving from other parts of Poland. To be reunited with his luckily found wife, at the end of 1939 Gomu≈Çka moved to Soviet-controlled Lviv. Like other members of the dissolved Communist Party of Poland, Gomu≈Çka sought a membership in the Soviet All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Soviet authorities allowed such membership transfers only from March 1941 and in April of that year Gomu≈Çka received his party card in Kiev. The circumstances of the Polish communists' lives changed dramatically after the 1941 German attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland. Reduced to penury in now German-occupied Lviv, the Gomu≈Çkas managed to join W≈Çadys≈Çaw's family in Krosno by the end of 1941. However, a momentous development soon took place in the sphere of communist political activity: in January 1942, Joseph Stalin reestablished in Warsaw a Polish communist party under the name of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR). In 1942, Gomu≈Çka participated in the reformation of a Polish communist party (the KPP was destroyed in Stalin's purges in the late 1930s) under the name Polish Workers' Party (Polska Partia Robotnicza, PPR). Gomu≈Çka became involved in the creation of party structures in the Subcarpathian region and began using his wartime conspiratorial pseudonym \\"Wies≈Çaw\\". In July 1942, Pawe≈Ç Finder brought Gomu≈Çka to occupied Warsaw. In August, the secretary of the PPR's regional Warsaw Committee was arrested by the Gestapo and \\"Wies≈Çaw\\" was entrusted with his job. In September Gomu≈Çka became a member of the PPR's Temporary Central Committee. In late 1942 and early 1943, the PPR experienced a severe crisis because of the murder of its first secretary Marceli Nowotko. Gomu≈Çka participated in the party investigation directed against another member of the leadership, Boles≈Çaw Mo≈Çojec, that resulted in Mo≈Çojec's execution. Together with the promoted to secretary Finder and Franciszek J√≥≈∫wiak, \\"Wies≈Çaw\\" (Gomu≈Çka) was included in the Party's new inner leadership, established in January 1943. The Central Committee was enlarged in the following months to include Boles≈Çaw Bierut, among others. In February 1943, Gomu≈Çka led the communist side in a series of important meetings in Warsaw between the PPR and the Government Delegation of the London-based Polish government-in-exile and the Home Army. The talks produced no results because of the divergent interests of the parties involved and a mutual lack of confidence. The Delegation officially discontinued the negotiations on April 28, three days after the Soviet government broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government. He became the Party's main ideologist. He wrote the \\"What do we fight for?\\" (O co walczymy?) publication dated 1 March 1943, and the much more comprehensive declaration that emerged under the same title in November. \\"Wies≈Çaw\\" supervised the Party's main editorial and publishing undertaking. Gomu≈Çka made efforts, largely unsuccessful, to secure for the PPR cooperation of other political forces in occupied Poland. Bierut was indifferent to any such attempts and counted simply on compulsion provided by a future presence of the Red Army in Poland. The different strategies resulted in a sharp conflict between the two communist politicians. =State National Council, Polish Committee of National Liberation= In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomu≈Çka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Ma≈Çgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomu≈Çka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three- person inner leadership. The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomu≈Çka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government. Gomu≈Çka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July. On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Os√≥bka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomu≈Çka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital. Post-war political career =Role in communist takeover of Poland= Gomu≈Çka was a deputy prime minister in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (RzƒÖd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej), from January to June 1945, and in the Provisional Government of National Unity (Tymczasowy RzƒÖd Jedno≈õci Narodowej), from 1945 to 1947. As a minister of Recovered Territories (1945‚Äì48), he exerted great influence over the rebuilding, integration and economic progress of Poland within its new borders, by supervising the settlement, development and administration of the lands acquired from Germany. Using his position in the PPR and government, Gomu≈Çka led the leftist social transformations in Poland and participated in the crushing of the resistance to the communist rule during the post-war years. He also helped the communists in winning the 3 x Tak (3 Times Yes) referendum of 1946. A year later, he played a key role in the 1947 parliamentary elections, which were fraudulently arranged to give the communists and their allies an overwhelming victory. After the elections, all remaining legal opposition in Poland was effectively destroyed. In June 1948, because of the impending unification of the PPR and PPS, Gomu≈Çka delivered a talk on the subject of the history of the Polish worker movement. Gomu≈Çka's already well-developed antisemitic tendencies were expressed in a memo written to Stalin in 1948, in which he argued that \\"some of the Jewish comrades don‚Äôt feel any link to the Polish nation or to the Polish working class‚Ä¶or they maintain a stance which might be described as ‚Äònational nihilism‚Äô\\".Applebaum, Anne. Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944‚Äì56. London: Penguin, 2013, p. 156 As a result, he considered it \\"absolutely necessary not only to stop any further growth in the percentage of Jews in the state as well as the party apparatus, but also to slowly lower that percentage, especially at the highest levels of the apparatus\\". =Temporary withdrawal from politics= In the late 1940s, Poland's communist government was split by a rivalry between Gomu≈Çka and President Boles≈Çaw Bierut. Gomu≈Çka led a home national group while Bierut headed a group reared by Stalin in the Soviet Union. The struggle ultimately led to Gomu≈Çka's removal from power in 1948. While Bierut advocated a policy of complete subservience to Moscow, Gomu≈Çka wanted to adopt the Communist blueprint to Polish circumstances. Among other things, he opposed forced collectivization, and was skeptical of the Cominform. The Bierut faction had Stalin's ear, and on Stalin's orders, Gomu≈Çka was sacked as party leader for \\"rightist-nationalist deviation,\\" replaced by Bierut. In December, soon after the PPR and Polish Socialist Party merged to form Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) (which was essentially the PPR under a new name), Gomu≈Çka was dropped from the merged party's Politburo. He was stripped of his remaining government posts in January 1949, and expelled from the party altogether in November. For the next eight years, he performed no official functions and was subjected to persecution, including almost four years of imprisonment from 1951 to 1954.Boleslaw Bierut at Encyclopedia BritannicaW≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka at Encyclopedia Britannica Bierut died in March 1956, during a period of de-Stalinization in Poland which gradually developed after Stalin's death. Edward Ochab became the new first secretary of the Party. Soon afterward, Gomu≈Çka was partially rehabilitated when Ochab conceded that Gomu≈Çka should not have been jailed, while reiterating the charges of \\"rightist-nationalist deviation\\" against him. =Rise to power= Gomu≈Çka's speech on 24 October 1956 in Warsaw In June 1956, violent worker protests broke out in Pozna≈Ñ. The worker riots were harshly suppressed and dozens of workers were killed. However, the Party leadership, which now included many reform-minded officials, recognized to some degree the validity of the protest participants' demands and took steps to placate the workers.Rothschild and Wingfield: Return to Diversity, A Political History of East Central Europe Since World War II OUP 2000 The reformers in the Party wanted a political rehabilitation of Gomu≈Çka and his return to the Party leadership. Gomu≈Çka insisted that he be given real power to implement further reforms. He wanted a replacement of some of the Party leaders, including the pro-Soviet Minister of Defense Konstantin Rokossovsky. The Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. Simultaneously with Soviet troop movements deep into Poland, a high-level Soviet delegation flew to Warsaw. It was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Mikoyan, Bulganin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Marshal Konev and others. Ochab and Gomu≈Çka made it clear that Polish forces would resist if Soviet troops advanced, but reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning the communist bloc or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets yielded. Following the wishes of the majority of the Politburo members, First Secretary Ochab conceded and on 20 October the Central Committee brought Gomu≈Çka and several associates into the Politburo, removed others, and elected Gomu≈Çka as first secretary of the Party. Gomu≈Çka, the former prisoner of the Stalinists, enjoyed wide popular support across the country, expressed by the participants of a massive street demonstration in Warsaw on 24 October. Seeing that Gomu≈Çka was popular with the Polish people, and given his insistence that he wanted to maintain the alliance with the Soviet Union and the presence of the Red Army in Poland, Khrushchev decided that Gomu≈Çka was a leader that Moscow could live with. Leadership of the Polish People's Republic Gomu≈Çka (left) greeted by members of the Ernst Th√§lmann Pioneer Organisation in East Germany. =Relations with other Eastern Bloc countries= A major factor that influenced Gomu≈Çka was the Oder-Neisse line issue. West Germany refused to recognize the Oder-Neisse line and Gomu≈Çka realized the fundamental instability of Poland's unilaterally imposed western border.Granville, Johanna \\"Reactions to the Events of 1956: New Findings from the Budapest and Warsaw Archives\\" pages 261-290 from Journal of Contemporary History, Volume 38, Issue #2, April 2003 pp. 284‚Äì85. He felt threatened by the revanchist statements put out by the Adenauer government and believed that the alliance with the Soviet Union was the only thing stopping the threat of a future German invasion.Granville, Johanna \\"From the Archives of Warsaw and Budapest: A Comparison of the Events of 1956\\" pp. 521‚Äì63 from East European Politics and Societies, Volume 16, Issue #2, April 2002 pp. 540‚Äì41 The new Party leader told the 8th Plenum of the PZPR on 19 October 1956 that: \\"Poland needs friendship with the Soviet Union more than the Soviet Union needs friendship with Poland... Without the Soviet Union we cannot maintain our borders with the West\\".Granville, Johanna \\"From the Archives of Warsaw and Budapest: A Comparison of the Events of 1956\\" pp. 521‚Äì63 from East European Politics and Societies, Volume 16, Issue #2, April 2002 p. 541 The treaty with West Germany was negotiated and signed in December 1970. The German side recognized the post-World War II borders, which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in Central Europe. During the events of the Prague Spring, Gomu≈Çka was one of the key leaders of the Warsaw Pact and supported Poland's participation in the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. =Domestic policies= In 1967‚Äì68 Gomu≈Çka allowed outbursts of \\"anti-Zionist\\" political propaganda,Judt, Tony (2005). Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945. New York, The Penguin Press pp. 434‚Äì35 which developed initially as a result of the Soviet bloc's frustration with the outcome of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War. It turned out to be a thinly veiled anti-Semitic campaign and purge of the army, pursued primarily by others in the Party, but utilized by Gomu≈Çka to keep himself in power by shifting the attention of the populace from the stagnating economy and mismanagement. The result was the emigration of the majority of the remaining Polish citizens of Jewish origin. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media. =Resignation and retirement= Gomu≈Çka's now abandoned retirement home in Konstancin-Jeziorna Gomu≈Çka's grave in PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery In December 1970, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent protests. Gomu≈Çka along with his right-hand man Zenon Kliszko ordered the regular Army under General Boles≈Çaw Chocha, to shoot striking workers with automatic weapons in Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia. Over 41 shipyard workers of the Baltic coast were killed in the ensuing police-state violence, while well over a thousand people were wounded. The events forced Gomu≈Çka's resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, Edward Gierek took over the Party leadership and tensions eased. Gomu≈Çka's negative image in communist propaganda after his removal was gradually modified and some of his constructive contributions were recognized. He is seen as an honest and austere believer in the socialist system, who, unable to resolve Poland's formidable difficulties and satisfy mutually contradictory demands, grew more rigid and despotic later in his career. A heavy smoker, he died in 1982 at the age of 77 of lung cancer. Gomu≈Çka's memoirs were not published until 1994, long after his death, and five years after the collapse of the communist regime which he served and led. The American journalist John Gunther described Gomu≈Çka in 1961 as being \\"professorial in manner, aloof, and angular, with a peculiar spry pepperiness\\".

Career highlights  Theater : By 1892, at the age of 16, Taylor's name as a thespian began to be published in theater reviews of newspapers in and around New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. Among the plays of that year featuring Taylor was By Wits Outwitted, written by Edward Owings Towne, where Taylor played the audacious hero (Valentine Navaro), and Florence Modena playing the pretty heroine (Fernanda). Taylor also played the part of Bill Smith, a farm hand, in A Glimpse of Paradise, by Frank S. Pixley, a one- act play that often preceded the three-act By Wits Outwitted. Music publishing and songwriting : Before launching his Chicago publishing firm in 1907, Taylor had co-founded one of the original Tin Pan Alley publishing houses in New York City with fellow composer, Ernest R. Ball, and former New York City Mayor who then was a state senator, James J. Walker. In 1918, Earl Kelly Smith (1886‚Äì1954), who had been affiliated with Taylor's Chicago publishing house since 1908, opened a branch in New York City. In Chicago, Taylor composed songs and ran his own sheet music publishing firm from 1907 to 1922. Post publishing & singing : In 1922, Taylor sold his Chicago publishing firm and purchased a farm for his parents near his boyhood home, on the outskirts of Findlay, Ohio, and spent the rest of his life there. By 1936, his top selling composition, \\"Down By The Old Mill Stream,\\" had sold 4 million copies. Death : In the Autumn of 1937, prior to embarking on a trip to California to discuss a motion picture about his life, Taylor entered a Chicago bar and ordered a drink. Tell sat at a table, put his head down to rest and died from a heart attack at the age of 61 on 23 November 1937 in Chicago. He was buried in Van Horn Cemetery, Findlay, Ohio. Posthumous lawsuit over song : In 1937, when the original copyright for \\"Down By The Old Mill Stream\\" was expiring, Earl Kelly Smith (1886‚Äì1954) filed an application to renew the copyright as co-composer. The renewal was granted. Jerry Vogel Music Company began publishing it. Forster Music, which had acquired the rights to the song from the heirs of Tell Taylor, filed suit to stop Vogel from publishing the song. In 1944, a US District Court in New York ruled in favor of Forster.  Selected works  = Popular songs = G.W.

Note that Buda Godman did not use her legal name Helen Julia Godman. On November 4, 1907, Taylor married Buda Godman (n√©e Helen Julia Godman; 1888‚ÄìUnknown), the daughter of Otho and Julia Godman (n√©e Conklin) of Chicago. Buda had met Taylor about two years prior when Taylor had been a dinner guest at the St. Joseph's Convent and Academy in Adrian, Michigan, where Helen had been attending school. Taylor had just started his songwriting career and was appearing with a traveling stage company in Adrian. Buda and Tell had become friends before dinner was over, but did not correspond afterward. Two years later, while attending the performance of \\"The Girl Question,\\" by Howard, Adams, and Hough, at a theater in Chicago, Buda recognized Tell and sent a note to him backstage, and they became reacquainted. After spending time together lunching and dining during the following week, they met for dinner at a Chicago hotel, and sent for a judge to marry them in the hotel's parlor. In 1910, Tell Taylor filed for divorce from Buda in Chicago. In late September of that year, the divorce was granted, with Tell accusing Buda of having \\"affinities\\" with other vaudevillains. In the divorce proceedings, Tell stated that \\"I married Buda when we both were drunk and I found out she was quite incapable of loyalty to anyone.\\" On July 8, 1913, Tell Taylor married again to Blanche Irene King (maiden; born 1887) in McLean County, Illinois. In 1921, Blanch filed for, and was granted a divorce from Tell Taylor in Chicago.

For his contributions to the team that developed this process, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960. A 1931 chemistry graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. During World War II he worked in the Manhattan Project's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, developing the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment. After the war, Libby accepted professorship at the University of Chicago's Institute for Nuclear Studies, where he developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he became a member of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration's atmospheric nuclear testing. Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959 to become Professor of Chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), a position he held until his retirement in 1976. In 1962, he became the Director of the University of California statewide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). He started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972, and as a member of the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air pollution standards. Early life and career Willard Frank Libby was born in Grand Valley, Colorado, on December 17, 1908, the son of farmers Ora Edward Libby and his wife Eva May (n√©e Rivers). He had two brothers, Elmer and Raymond, and two sisters, Eva and Evelyn. Libby began his education in a two-room Colorado schoolhouse. When he was five, Libby's parents moved to Santa Rosa, California. He attended Analy High School, in Sebastopol, from which he graduated in 1926. Libby, who grew to be tall, played tackle on the high school football team. In 1927 he entered the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his B.S. in 1931, and his Ph.D. in 1933, writing his doctoral thesis on the \\"Radioactivity of ordinary elements, especially samarium and neodymium: method of detection\\" under the supervision of Wendell Mitchell Latimer. Independently of the work of George de Hevesy and Max Pahl, he discovered that the natural long-lived isotopes of samarium primarily decay by emission of alpha particles. Libby was appointed Instructor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1933. He became an assistant professor of Chemistry there in 1938. He spent the 1930s building sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. He joined Berkeley's chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma in 1941. That year he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and elected to work at Princeton University. Manhattan Project On December 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Libby volunteered his services to Nobel Prize laureate Harold Urey. Urey arranged for Libby to be given leave from the University of California, Berkeley and to join him at Columbia University to work on the Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop atomic bombs, at what became its Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. During his time in the New York City area, Libby was a resident of Leonia, New Jersey. Over the next three years, Libby worked on the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore had to find a way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find. Through 1942, Libby and his team studied different barriers and the means to protect them from corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride. The most promising type was a barrier made of powdered nickel developed by Edward O. Norris of the Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler from the City College of New York, which became known as the \\"Norris-Adler\\" barrier by late 1942. In addition to developing a suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had to assist in the design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all- out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943. As 1943 gave way to 1944, many problems remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process. Construction of the upper stages of the K-25 plant was cancelled, and Kellex was directed to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. The last of K-25's 2,892 stages commenced operation in August 1945. On August 5, K-25 starting producing feed enriched to 23 percent uranium-235. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential only in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants. Enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Libby brought home a stack of newspapers and told his wife, \\"This is what I've been doing.\\" Radiocarbon dating After the war, Libby accepted an offer from the University of Chicago of a professorship in the Chemistry Department at the new Institute for Nuclear Studies. He returned to his pre-war studies of radioactivity. In 1939, Serge Korff had discovered that cosmic rays generated neutrons in the upper atmosphere. These interact with nitrogen-14 in the air to produce carbon-14: including the Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1960 Radiocarbon Dating :1n + 14N ‚Üí 14C + 1p The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730¬±40 years. Libby realized that when plants and animals die they cease to ingest fresh carbon-14, thereby giving any organic compound a built-in nuclear clock. He published his theory in 1946, and expanded on it in his monograph Radiocarbon Dating in 1955. He also developed sensitive radiation detectors that could use the technique. Tests against sequoia with known dates from their tree rings showed radiocarbon dating to be reliable and accurate. The technique revolutionised archaeology, palaeontology and other disciplines that dealt with ancient artefacts. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his method to use carbon-14 for age determination in archaeology, geology, geophysics, and other branches of science\\". He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine. Atomic Energy Commission Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean appointed Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he was appointed an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the recommendation of Dean's successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him a truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, he was one of the few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958. As the only scientist among the five AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore less important than the risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing. UCLA Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959, he became Professor of Chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles, a position he held until his retirement in 1976. He taught honors freshman chemistry. In 1962, he became the Director of the University of California statewide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), a position he also held until 1976. His time as director encompassed the Apollo space program and the lunar landings. Libby started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As a member of the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California's air pollution standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made. Although Libby retired and became a professor emeritus in 1976, he remained professionally active until his death in 1980. Awards and honors Libby was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received numerous honors and awards, including Columbia University's Chandler Medal in 1954, the Remsen Memorial Lecture Award in 1955, the Bicentennial Lecture Award from the City College of New York and the Nuclear Applications in Chemistry Award in 1956, the Franklin Institute's Elliott Cresson Medal in 1957, the American Chemical Society's Willard Gibbs Award in 1958, the Joseph Priestley Award from Dickinson College and the Albert Einstein Medal in 1959, the Geological Society of America's Arthur L. Day Medal in 1961, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1961, the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Chemists in 1970, and the Lehman Award from the New York Academy of Sciences in 1971. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1950. Analy High School library has a mural of Libby, and a Sebastopol city park and a nearby highway are named in his honor. His 1947 paper on radiocarbon dating was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the University of Chicago in 2016. Personal In 1940, Libby married Leonor Hickey, a physical education teacher. They had twin daughters, Janet Eva and Susan Charlotte, who were born in 1945. In 1966 Libby divorced Leonor and married Leona Woods Marshall, a distinguished nuclear physicist who was one of the original builders of Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor. She joined him at UCLA as a professor of environmental engineering in 1973. Through this second marriage he acquired two stepsons, the children of her first marriage. Libby died at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles on September 8, 1980, from a blood clot in his lung complicated by pneumonia. His papers are in the Charles E. Young Research Library at the UCLA. Seven volumes of his papers were edited by Leona and Rainer Berger and published in 1981. Bibliography * Arnold, J.R. and W. F.

It can be proven that, if a function F(s) has the inverse Laplace transform f(t), then f(t) is uniquely determined (considering functions which differ from each other only on a point set having Lebesgue measure zero as the same). This result was first proven by Mathias Lerch in 1903 and is known as Lerch's theorem. The Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamical systems. Mellin's inverse formula An integral formula for the inverse Laplace transform, called the Mellin's inverse formula, the Bromwich integral, or the Fourier‚ÄìMellin integral, is given by the line integral: :f(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\\\\\{F(s)\\\\\\\\}(t) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_{\\\\gamma- iT}^{\\\\gamma+iT}e^{st}F(s)\\\\,ds where the integration is done along the vertical line Re(s) = Œ≥ in the complex plane such that Œ≥ is greater than the real part of all singularities of F(s) and F(s) is bounded on the line, for example if contour path is in the region of convergence. If all singularities are in the left half-plane, or F(s) is an entire function , then Œ≥ can be set to zero and the above inverse integral formula becomes identical to the inverse Fourier transform. In practice, computing the complex integral can be done by using the Cauchy residue theorem. Post's inversion formula Post's inversion formula for Laplace transforms, named after Emil Post, is a simple-looking but usually impractical formula for evaluating an inverse Laplace transform. The statement of the formula is as follows: Let f(t) be a continuous function on the interval [0, ‚àû) of exponential order, i.e. : \\\\sup_{t>0} \\\\frac{f(t)}{e^{bt}} < \\\\infty for some real number b. Then for all s > b, the Laplace transform for f(t) exists and is infinitely differentiable with respect to s. Furthermore, if F(s) is the Laplace transform of f(t), then the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is given by : f(t) = \\\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\\\\\\\{F(s)\\\\\\\\}(t) = \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \\\\left( \\\\frac{k}{t} \\\\right) ^{k+1} F^{(k)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{k}{t} \\\\right) for t > 0, where F(k) is the k-th derivative of F with respect to s. As can be seen from the formula, the need to evaluate derivatives of arbitrarily high orders renders this formula impractical for most purposes. With the advent of powerful personal computers, the main efforts to use this formula have come from dealing with approximations or asymptotic analysis of the Inverse Laplace transform, using the Grunwald‚ÄìLetnikov differintegral to evaluate the derivatives. Post's inversion has attracted interest due to the improvement in computational science and the fact that it is not necessary to know where the poles of F(s) lie, which make it possible to calculate the asymptotic behaviour for big x using inverse Mellin transforms for several arithmetical functions related to the Riemann hypothesis.

The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen who would draw the picture and the text \\"Kilroy was here\\" on the walls and other places where they were stationed, encamped, or visited. An ad in Life magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that \\"whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that 'Kilroy was here. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom.Brewer's: Cassell, 1956. p. 523 At some point, the graffiti (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged. Many sources claim origin as early as 1939. An early example of the phrase may date from 1937, before World War II. The US History Channel broadcast Fort Knox: Secrets Revealed in 2007 included a shot of a chalked \\"KILROY WAS HERE\\" dated 13 May 1937. Fort Knox's vault was loaded in 1937 and inaccessible until the 1970s, when an audit was carried out and the footage was shot. However, historian Paul Urbahns was involved in the production of the program, and he says that the footage was a reconstruction. According to one story, German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This led Adolf Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found \\"Kilroy was here\\" written in the VIP bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was.Rottman, Gordon L.: FUBAR: Soldier Slang of World War II War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne in December 1944: \\"On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of McAuliffe's GIs: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE.\\" = Foo was here = Digger History, the Unofficial history of the Australian & New Zealand Armed Services, says of Foo that \\"He was chalked on the side of railway carriages, appeared in probably every camp that the 1st AIF World War I served in and generally made his presence felt\\". If this is the case, then \\"Foo was here\\" predates the American version of World War II, \\"Kilroy was here\\", by about 25 years. \\"Foo\\" was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force. It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for Forward Observation Officer. = Real Kilroys = The Oxford English Dictionary says simply that Kilroy was \\"the name of a mythical person\\". One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902‚Äì1962), an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature. The New York Times indicated J. J. Kilroy as the origin in 1946, based on the results of a contest conducted by the American Transit Association to establish the origin of the phenomenon. Usually, inspectors made a small chalk mark which welders used to erase, so that they would be paid double for their work. To prevent this, Kilroy marked work he had inspected and approved with the phrase \\"Kilroy was here\\" in more durable crayon. The article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships as they were being built as a way to be sure that he had inspected a compartment, and the phrase would be found chalked in places that nobody could have reached for graffiti, such as inside sealed hull spaces.\\"Transit Association Ships a Street Car To Shelter Family of 'Kilroy Was Here'\\", The New York Times, 24 December 1946. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that \\"the phrase grew by accident.\\" The Lowell Sun reported in November 1945 that Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr. from Everett, Massachusetts, wrote \\"Kilroy will be here next week\\" on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton, Florida, airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported Sgt. Kilroy's account of being hospitalized early in World War II, and his friend Sgt. James Maloney wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, according to the AP account, and other airmen soon picked it up. Francis Kilroy only wrote the phrase a couple of times.  Chad  Omega is one suggested origin for Chad Kilroy/Chad as an RLC circuit arranged to create a band-stop filter The figure was initially known in the United Kingdom as \\"Mr Chad\\" and would appear with the slogan \\"Wot, no sugar\\" or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The phrase \\"Wot, no --?\\" pre-dates \\"Chad\\" and was widely used separately from the doodle. Chad was used by the RAF and civilians; he was known in the Army as Private Snoops, and in the Navy he was called The Watcher. Chad might have first been drawn by British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton in 1938. Chatterton was nicknamed \\"Chat\\", which may then have become \\"Chad\\". Life Magazine wrote in 1946 that the RAF and Army were competing to claim him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944. The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933, and another name for Chad was \\"The Goon\\". A spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London suggested in 1977 that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter Omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew. Life suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current resembles Chad (a sine wave through a straight line), that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of electrical resistors. The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave. The Guardian suggested in 2000 that \\"Mr. Chad\\" was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that a man named Dickie Lyle was at RAF Yatesbury in 1941, and he drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room and wrote \\"Wot, no leave?\\" beneath it. This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 which included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, who drew the circuit diagram with the words \\"WOT! No electrons?\\" The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick. This version was initially called Domie or Doomie, and Life noted that Doomie was used by the RAF. REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed \\"Chad's Temple\\"; the RAF claimed that it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school; and the Desert Rats claimed that it came from an officer in El Alamein. It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple \\"What, no bread?\\" or \\"Wot, no char?\\" to the plaintive; one sighting was on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden with the complaint \\"Wot, no engines?\\" The Los Angeles Times reported in 1946 that Chad was \\"the No. 1 doodle\\", noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with \\"Wot, no Tories?\\" Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase \\"Wot‚Äîno Fuehrer?\\" As rationing became less common, so did the joke. The cartoon is occasionally sighted today as \\"Kilroy was here\\", but \\"Chad\\" and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.  Smoe  Writing about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946, The Milwaukee Journal describes the doodle as the European counterpart to \\"Kilroy was here\\", under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater. It noted that next to \\"Kilroy was here\\" was often added \\"And so was Smoe\\". While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946. A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for \\"Sad men of Europe\\". Correspondents to Life magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.  Other names  Similar drawings appear in many countries. Herbie (Canada), Overby (Los Angeles, late 1960s), Flywheel, Private Snoops, The Jeep, and Clem (Canada) are alternative names. An advertisement in Billboard in November 1946 for plastic \\"Kilroys\\" also used the names Clem, Heffinger, Luke the Spook, Some, and Stinkie. \\"Luke the Spook\\" was the name of a B-29 bomber, and its nose-art resembles the doodle and is said to have been created at the Boeing factory in Seattle. In Chile, the graphic is known as a \\"sapo\\" (slang for nosy). In Poland, Kilroy is replaced with \\"J√≥zef Tkaczuk\\" or \\"M. Pulina\\". In Russia, the phrase \\"Vasya was here\\" () is a notorious piece of graffiti. In popular culture Kilroy has been seen in numerous television series and films and in computer and video games. Peter Viereck wrote in 1948 that \\"God is like Kilroy. He, too, Sees it all.\\" Isaac Asimov's short story \\"The Message\\" (1955) depicts a time-travelling George Kilroy from the 30th century as the writer of the graffiti. Thomas Pynchon's novel V. (1963) includes the proposal that the Kilroy doodle originated from a band-pass filter diagram. Ken Young wrote a parody of 'Twas the Night Before Christmas which was transmitted to Apollo 8 on December 25, 1968. It featured the lines \\"When what to his wondering eyes should appear, but a Burma Shave sign saying, 'Kilroy was here'.\\" Kilroy was also featured on New Zealand stamp #1422 issued on March 19, 1997. In the 1975 M*A*S*H episode \\"The Bus,\\" Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) writes \\"Kilroy\\" in a dust-encrusted bus window as B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell) peers out from behind the window, his hands and nose resting on its top edge. In the opening credits of the 2009 American sitcom Community, two Kilroys are drawn in blue ink on the inside of a paper fortune teller, their noses forming the L's of lead actor Joel McHale's name. In June 2017 Kevin Smith started shooting a horror film based on Kilroy, titled Killroy Was Here. Kilroy is used in the motion graphics computer program Adobe After Effects as the icon used to \\"Shy\\" a Layer or Layers in an animation, hiding them from the user.

He was born in the small village of Trocnov (now part of Borovany) in the Kingdom of Bohemia into an aristocratic family. He was nicknamed \\"One-eyed ≈Ωi≈æka\\". From his youth, he was attached to the royal court and held the office of Chamberlain to Queen Sofia of Bavaria. He fought in the Battle of Grunwald (July 15, 1410), where he defended Radzy≈Ñ against the Teutonic Order. Later he played a prominent role in the civil wars in Bohemia during the reign of Wenceslas IV. ≈Ωi≈æka's tactics were unorthodox and innovative. In addition to training and equipping his army according to their abilities, he used armored wagons fitted with small cannons and muskets, anticipating the tank of five hundred years later. He knew how to exploit geographic features to the full, and maintain discipline in his armies. In the Battle of Kutn√° Hora (1421) he defeated the army of the Holy Roman Empire and Hungary. The effectiveness of field artillery against the royal cavalry in the battle turned field artillery into a firm part of Hussite armies. ≈Ωi≈æka is considered to be among the greatest military leaders and innovators of all time. His accomplishments in this regard are especially unique and noteworthy as he had to quickly train peasants to repeatedly face highly trained and armored opponents who usually severely outnumbered his own troops, and for this, some have considered him to be the one of the greatest generals in history. A monument was erected on the V√≠tkov Hill in Prague to honor Jan ≈Ωi≈æka and his victory on this hill in 1420. It is the third largest bronze equestrian statue in the world. About Zizka's and other bronze horse statues (In Czech) Grunwald ≈Ωi≈æka was on the winning side of the Battle of Grunwald, also called the 1st Battle of Tannenberg, one of the largest battles in Medieval Europe. It was fought on July 15, 1410, during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìTeutonic War. The alliance of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King of Poland W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço and Grand Duke Vytautas (Witold), decisively defeated the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership were killed or taken prisoner. The Knights never recovered their former power and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in their lands. The battle shifted the balance of power in Eastern Europe. Rise to prominence illumination from the late 1400s) ≈Ωi≈æka was the military leader of the Hussites in the Hussite Wars. The Hussites were a proto-Protestant, Christian movement following the teachings of Czech priest, philosopher, reformer, and master at Charles University in Prague, Jan Hus (c. 1369‚Äì1415). On November 13, 1419 a temporary armistice was concluded between the partisans of King Sigismund, the last Emperor of the House of Luxemburg and the citizens of Prague. ≈Ωi≈æka disapproved of this compromise and left Prague for Plze≈à, one of the richest cities of the kingdom with his followers, but soon left that city. On March 25, 1420 he defeated the partisans of Sigismund at Sudomƒõ≈ô, the first pitched battle of the Hussite wars. He later arrived at T√°bor, the then-recently established stronghold of the Hussite movement. The ecclesiastical organization of Tabor had a somewhat puritanical character with a very strict military discipline being instituted though the government was established on a thoroughly democratic basis. ≈Ωi≈æka took a large part in the organization of the new military community and became one of the four captains of the people (hejtman) who were at its head. =Wagenburg tactics= Jan ≈Ωi≈æka z Trocnova, fictional portrait by Jan Vil√≠mek ≈Ωi≈æka helped develop tactics of using wagon forts, called vozov√° hradba in Czech or Wagenburg by the Germans, as mobile fortifications. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent they prepared carts for the battle by forming them into squares or circles. The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16‚Äì22 soldiers: 4‚Äì8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6‚Äì8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite \\"national weapon\\"), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers. The Hussites' battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range. In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell. As soon as the enemy's morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts striking violently at the enemy, mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shelled from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives. =Gunpowder weapons= The Hussite wars also marked the earliest successful use of pistols on the battlefield and ≈Ωi≈æka was an innovator in the use of gunpowder. He was the first European commander to maneuver on the field with cannon of medium caliber mounted on carts in between the wagons.Sedlar, Jean W. (1994), A history of East Central Europe: East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, University of Washington Press. p. 234. The Czechs called the handgun a p√≠≈°≈•ala, and anti-infantry field guns houfnice, from which the English words \\"pistol\\" and \\"howitzer\\" have been derived. The Germans had just started corning gunpowder, making it suitable for use in smaller, tactical weapons. A musketeer on an open field armed with only a single-shot weapon was no match for a charging knight on a horse; however, from behind a castle wall, or from within the enclosure of the wagenburg, massed and disciplined gunmen could use the handgun to its greatest potential. From his experiences at the Battle of Grunwald, ≈Ωi≈æka knew exactly how his enemies would attack, and he found new ways to defeat forces numerically superior to his own. Hussite Crusades The Hussite Wars were fought to win recognition of faith of the Hussites, the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation, and though predominantly a religious movement, it was also propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. The Catholic Church deemed Hus's teachings heretical. He was excommunicated in 1411, condemned by the Council of Constance, and burned at the stake in 1415. The wars proper began in July 1419, with the First Defenestration of Prague, when protesting Hussites threw the town councillors and the judge out the windows of the New Town Hall. It has been reputed that King Wenceslaus IV was so stunned by the defenestration that he died from the shock shortly afterward on 16 August 1419. This led to the armed conflict in which ≈Ωi≈æka would earn his fame. =The first anti-Hussite crusade= A painting by Mikol√°≈° Ale≈° showing Jan ≈Ωi≈æka as hussite general Jan ≈Ωi≈æka in a detail of Jan Matejko's Battle of Grunwald King Sigismund was king of Hungary but only the titular king of Bohemia. Sigismund had acquired a claim on the Bohemian crown, though it was then in question (and remained so till much later) whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (ƒåenƒõk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund's claim to not be accepted. A firm adherent of the Church of Rome, Sigismund was successful in obtaining aid from Pope Martin V, who issued a bull on 17 March 1420 which proclaimed a crusade ‚Äúfor the destruction of the John Wycliffe, Hussites and all other heretics in Bohemia\\". Sigismund and many German princes arrived before the walls of Prague on June 30 at the head of a vast army of crusaders from all parts of Europe, largely consisting of adventurers attracted by the possibility of pillage. They immediately began a siege of the city and ≈Ωi≈æka was compelled to defend the Kingdom. He was a pragmatist in developing his military strategy. His army consisted of farmers and peasants, lacking both the funds and equipment to be classic soldiers with sword, horse and armor, so ≈Ωi≈æka used their farmers' skills to boost their military efficiency. He adapted the tools of agriculture into the tools of war. The agricultural flail was transformed into the flail. Menaced by Sigismund, the citizens of Prague entreated the Taborites for assistance. Led by ≈Ωi≈æka and their other captains, the Taborites set out to take part in the defence of the capital. At Prague, ≈Ωi≈æka and his men took up a strong position on the hill just outside the city known as the V√≠tkov, now in ≈Ωi≈ækov, a district of Prague named after the battle in his honour. On July 14 the armies of Sigismund made a general attack. A strong German Crusader-led force assaulted the position on the V√≠tkov, the stronghold that secured the Hussite communications with the open country. Thanks to ≈Ωi≈æka's personal leadership, the attack was thrown back and the forces of Sigismund abandoned the siege. On August 22 the Taborites left Prague and returned to T√°bor. Though Sigismund had retired from Prague, the castles of Vy≈°ehrad and Hradƒçany remained in possession of his troops. The citizens of Prague laid siege to the Vy≈°ehrad (see Battle of Vy≈°ehrad), and towards the end of October the garrison was on the point of capitulating through famine. Sigismund attempted to relieve the fortress, but was decisively defeated by the Hussites on November 1 near the village of Pankr√°c. The castles of Vy≈°ehrad and Hradƒçany now capitulated, and shortly afterwards almost all Bohemia fell into the hands of the Hussites. ≈Ωi≈æka now engaged in constant warfare with the partisans of Sigismund, particularly with the powerful Romanist, Old≈ôich II of Ro≈æmberk. Through this struggle, the Hussites obtained possession of the greater part of Bohemia from Sigismund. It was proposed to elect the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas to the throne. However, the estates of Bohemia and Moravia met at ƒå√°slav on June 1, 1421 and decided to appoint a provisional government, consisting of twenty members chosen from all the political and religious parties of the country. ≈Ωi≈æka, who took part in the deliberations at ƒå√°slav, was elected as one of the two representatives of T√°bor. ≈Ωi≈æka summarily suppressed some disturbances on the part of a fanatical sect called the Adamites. He then continued his campaigns against the Romanists and the adherents of Sigismund, and having captured and rebuilt a small castle near Litomƒõ≈ôice (Leitmeritz) he retained possession of it, the only reward for his great services that he ever received or claimed. According to the Hussite custom he gave the Biblical name of Chalice (Kalich in Czech) to this new possession, and henceforth adopted the signature of ≈Ωi≈æka of the Chalice. Jan ≈Ωi≈æka did not capture any more properties for himself during the Hussite Wars. This fact was unusual for the time and distinguished ≈Ωi≈æka from his contemporaries. Later that year he was severely wounded while besieging the castle of R√°b√≠, and lost the use of his remaining eye. Though now totally blind, he continued to command the armies of T√°bor. =The second anti-Hussite crusade= At the end of 1421, Sigismund, again attempted to subdue Bohemia and gained possession of the important town of Kutn√° Hora. The mainly German citizens of the city killed a few of the Hussites in the town and closed the city to ≈Ωi≈æka, whose armies were camped outside the city walls. Sigismund's armies arrived and surrounded the Hussites. ≈Ωi≈æka was at the head of the united armies of T√°bor and Prague and though trapped managed to execute what some historians call the first mobile artillery manoeuver in history. ≈Ωi≈æka broke through the enemy lines and retreated to Kol√≠n, but having received reinforcements he attacked and defeated Sigismund's unsuspecting army at the village of Nebovidy between Kol√≠n and Kutn√° Hora on January 6, 1422. Sigismund lost 12,000 men and only escaped himself by rapid flight. Sigismund's forces made a last stand at Nƒõmeck√Ω Brod (Deutschbrod) on 10 January, but the city was stormed by the Czechs, and contrary to ≈Ωi≈æka's orders, its defenders were put to the sword. Civil war Statue of ≈Ωi≈æka in T√°bor's town square (≈Ωi≈æka Square), J. Stachovsky, 1884. Early in 1423, internal dissent among the Hussites led to civil war. ≈Ωi≈æka, as leader of the Taborites, defeated the men of Prague and the Utraquist nobles at Ho≈ôice on April 20. Shortly afterwards came news that a new crusade against Bohemia was being prepared. This induced the Hussites to conclude an armistice at Konopi≈°tƒõ on June 24. As soon as the crusaders had dispersed, internal dissent broke out anew. During his temporary rule over Bohemia, Prince Sigismund Korybut of Lithuania had appointed Bo≈ôek, the lord of Milet√≠nek, governor of the city of Hradec Kr√°lov√©. Bo≈ôek belonged to a moderate Hussite faction, the Utraquist party. After the departure of Sigismund Korybut, the city of Hradec Kr√°lov√© refused to recognize Bo≈ôek as its ruler, due to the democratic party gaining the upper hand. They called ≈Ωi≈æka to its aid. He acceded to the demand and defeated the Utraquists under Bo≈ôek at the farm of Strachov, near the city of Hradec Kr√°lov√© on August 4, 1423. ≈Ωi≈æka now attempted to invade Hungary, which was under the rule of his old enemy King Sigismund. Though this Hungarian campaign was unsuccessful owing to the great superiority of the Hungarians, it ranks among the greatest military exploits of ≈Ωi≈æka, on account of the skill he displayed in retreat. In 1424, civil war having again broken out in Bohemia, ≈Ωi≈æka decisively defeated the \\"Praguers\\" and Utraquist nobles at Skalice on January 6, and at Male≈°ov on June 7. In September, he marched on Prague. On the 14th of that month, peace was concluded between the Hussite parties through the influence of John of Rokycany, afterwards Utraquist archbishop of Prague. It was agreed that the now reunited Hussites should attack Moravia, part of which was still held by Sigismund's partisans, and that ≈Ωi≈æka should be the leader in this campaign. However, he died of the plague at P≈ôibyslav on October 11, 1424 on the Moravian frontier. According to chronicler Piccolomini, ≈Ωi≈æka's dying wish was to have his skin used to make drums so that he might continue to lead his troops even after death. ≈Ωi≈æka was so well regarded that when he died, his soldiers called themselves the Orphans (sirotci) because they felt like they had lost their father. His enemies said that \\"The one whom no mortal hand could destroy was extinguished by the finger of God.\\" He was succeeded by Prokop the Great.  In popular culture  ≈Ωi≈æka appears as one of the main characters in the Armed Garden graphic novella (The Armed Garden and Other Stories) by David B.The Armed Garden and Other Stories, Amazon Reference. He is the hero of a novel by George Sand, of a German epic by Meissner, and of a Bohemian tragedy by Alois Jir√°sek. Jan ≈Ωi≈æka is a central figure of the \\"Hussite Revolutionary Trilogy\\" directed by Otakar V√°vra. The films starred Zdenƒõk ≈†tƒõp√°nek as ≈Ωi≈æka. It consists of Jan Hus, Jan ≈Ωi≈æka and Against All. Jan ≈Ωi≈æka appeared in a 1960 Polish film Knights of the Teutonic Order. He is played by Tadeusz Schmidt. In 1968 Czechoslovak film Na ≈Ωi≈ækovƒõ v√°leƒçn√©m voze, ≈Ωi≈æka was played by Ilja Pracha≈ô. A film Jan ≈Ωi≈æka is currently in works by director Petr J√°kl. It will follow Jan ≈Ωi≈æka during his youth. It is expected to be released in 2021 and will be the most expensive Czech film. Jan ≈Ωi≈æka is one of the main characters in the manga \\"D√≠vƒç√≠ V√°lka\\" (also known as \\"Otome Sensou\\" or \\"Battle of the Maidens\\"), drawn and written by artist Kouichi Ohnishi. =World War I= Early in 1917 was created 3rd Czechoslovak Rifle Regiment of the Czechoslovak legions in Russia and named after \\"Jan ≈Ωi≈æka z Trocnova\\".PRECL√çK, Vratislav.

They played in Major League Soccer (MLS) for four seasons, from 1998 to 2001. Announced in 1997 as one of the league's first two expansion teams, their best season was 2001, when they won the Supporters' Shield with the best regular season finish. In 2002, after four years of lackluster ticket sales and revenues, MLS contracted the Fusion along with its other Florida-based team, the Tampa Bay Mutiny. The Fusion played their home games at Lockhart Stadium. History =Early history= Major League Soccer announced a South Florida team in 1997 as one of its first two expansions, along with the Chicago Fire. Miami businessman Ken Horowitz served as owner, the first new investor to join Major League Soccer since its founding in 1995. The team, ultimately named the Miami Fusion, debuted in the 1998 MLS season, playing in Lockhart Stadium, the league's first soccer-specific stadium.Rusnak, Jeff (October 8, 2012). \\"Fusion's Lockhart Stadium stint paved way for new MLS venues\\". Sun-Sentinel. Retrieved March 13, 2014. The Fusion started their inaugural season strong. Led by star midfielder Carlos Valderrama, the Fusion drew 20,450 to their first game at Lockhart Stadium against D.C. United, showing off the possibilities of a more intimate venue designed especially for soccer. Another 3,000 were turned away by police. However, interest waned through the year along with the team's middling performance on the field. The Fusion replaced head coach Carlos \\"Cacho\\" Cordoba with Ivo Wortmann after game 19, and the team managed a playoff spot, losing to D.C. By the end of the year their average attendance had dropped to 10,284. The Fusion continued to struggle both on and off the field for the next two years. After years of disagreement, the commissioner \\"reassigned\\" Carlos Valderrama back to Tampa Bay in 1999, and the team replaced head coach Ivo Wortmann with Ray Hudson mid-season in 2000. The team made a dramatic improvement in the 2001 season, winning the Supporters' Shield with the best regular season performance, taking the Eastern Conference, and advancing to the league semifinals. Attendance improved as well, but remained fourth worst in the league with an average of 11,177. In the front office, owner Ken Horowitz struggled with finances. He, along with Robert Kraft of the New England Revolution and Stuart Subotnick of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, formed a faction among MLS owners who wanted to keep spending down, as opposed to Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz who wished to invest in long-term development. Despite the team's improvements, by the end of the 2001 season they had the league's lowest season ticket sales and the lowest revenues from sponsors. =Demise= Major League Soccer had reportedly lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years.New York Times, For M.L.S., the Sport's Future Is in the Eye of the Beholder, November 11, 2005, https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/sports/soccer/11soccer.html The league's poor financial condition forced MLS to stop the bleeding. During the winter break between the 2000 and 2001 seasons, reports began circulating that MLS was considering trimming the league from 12 teams back to 10 teams.ESPN.com Soccernet, MLS considering weight-loss program, http://espn.go.com/soccer/s/2000/1228/977891.html Rumors began circulating that the league might pull the plug on the Fusion, even though the Fusion had a low-cost stadium lease, and an improved performance in 2001 with increased fan attendance.Sun Sentinel, Fusion Owner Looking For Way Out, December 15, 2001, http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2001-12-15/sports/0112150073_1_five- mls-teams-ken-horowitz-fusion MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the two Florida franchises, the Fusion and the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Both teams were withdrawn from the league, ceased operations and folded. Major League Soccer's contraction reduced the league from 12 to 10 teams. The league had chosen to fold the Miami Fusion, in part because the Fusion's ownership reportedly lacked financial resources, had been trying to run the Fusion on a bare-minimum budget, and had asked the league to pay some of the club's expenses. Commissioner Garber stated that the Fusion had the lowest revenue in the league, due to fewer season tickets and almost no revenue from corporate sponsorships.Sports Illustrated, Garber, Horowitz discuss MLS contraction, January 9, 2002, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/us/news/2002/01/09/mls_quotes/ Miami ownership had reportedly experienced $15 million in operating losses since Miami joined the league.SoccerTimes.com, MLS fans in several cities wait nervously for contraction decision, December 27, 2001, http://www.soccertimes.com/wagman/2001/dec27.htm The Fusion's owner, Ken Horowitz, described several difficulties with operating an MLS soccer franchise in South Florida. Many Miami residents were not originally from the area and didn't identify with and support local sports teams. Additionally, the MLS season is in the summer, which is different from the youth soccer season, making it difficult to draw youth soccer teams to attend Fusion matches. There were also issues with local summertime heat and rain. Finally, Horowitz identified a lack of corporate support for the team. On April 2, 2015, a new club with the name Miami Fusion FC joined the fourth-tier National Premier Soccer League. The club dissolved in 2018. Stadium Lockhart Stadium The Fusion played their home games at Fort Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium. They had originally intended to play at the Orange Bowl Stadium in downtown Miami, but could not reach an agreement with the city of Miami, as the city wanted a 10-year lease and a prohibition on the team relocating to another South Florida stadium. Subsequently, the Fusion reached an agreement with the Broward County School Board and the city of Fort Lauderdale to use Lockhart Stadium. Originally constructed as a high school football and track stadium in 1959, Lockhart had hosted the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the original North American Soccer League from 1977 to 1983, as well as other soccer games. Fusion owner Ken Horowitz spearheaded a $5 million renovation that converted Lockhart into a 20,000-seat soccer-specific stadium. The new stadium was the first of its kind in Major League Soccer; at the time all other teams played in much larger football stadiums. This innovation set a trend for similar facilities throughout the league that continues today.

This genus is responsible for approximately 95% of the fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is Œ±-amanitin. The genus also contains many edible mushrooms, but mycologists discourage mushroom hunters, other than knowledgeable experts, from selecting any of these for human consumption. Nonetheless, in some cultures, the larger local edible species of Amanita are mainstays of the markets in the local growing season. Samples of this are Amanita zambiana and other fleshy species in central Africa, A. basii and similar species in Mexico, A. caesarea and the \\"Blusher\\" Amanita rubescens in Europe, and A. chepangiana in South-East Asia. Other species are used for colouring sauces, such as the red A. jacksonii, with a range from eastern Canada to eastern Mexico. Many species are of unknown edibility, especially in countries such as Australia, where many fungi are little-known. Taxonomy The name is possibly derived from Amanus (), a mountain in Cilicia. The genus Amanita was first published with its current meaning by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797.Persoon, C.H. (1797) Tent. disp. meth. fung.: 65 Under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Persoon's concept of Amanita, with Amanita muscaria (L.) Pers. as the type species, has been officially conserved against the older Amanita Boehm (1760), which is considered a synonym of Agaricus L.J. McNeill et al. (eds)(2006) International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Vienna, 2005), Appendix IIIA Nomina generica conservanda et rejicienda, B. Fungi Toxicity A. phalloides, the Death Cap Several members of the section Phalloidieae are notable for their toxicity, containing toxins known as amatoxins, which can cause liver failure and death. These include the death cap A. phalloides; species known as destroying angels, including A. virosa, A. bisporigera and A. ocreata; and the fool's mushroom, A. verna. More recently, a series in the subgenus Lepidella has been found to cause acute kidney failure, including A. smithiana of northwestern North America, A. pseudoporphyria of Japan, and A. proxima of southern Europe.Loizides M, Bellanger JM, Yiangou Y, Moreau PA. (2018). Preliminary phylogenetic investigations into the genus Amanita (Agaricales) in Cyprus, with a review of previous records and poisoning incidents. Documents Mycologiques 37: 201‚Äì218. Edibility A. caesarea (edible) Although some species of Amanita are edible, many fungi experts advise against eating a member of Amanita unless the species is known with absolute certainty. Because so many species within this genus are so deadly toxic, if a specimen is identified incorrectly, consumption may cause extreme sickness and possibly death. =Edible= Edible species of Amanita include Amanita fulva, Amanita vaginata (grisette), Amanita calyptrata (coccoli), Amanita crocea, Amanita rubescens (blusher), Amanita caesarea (Caesar's mushroom), and Amanita jacksonii (American Caesar's mushroom). =Inedible= Inedible species of Amanita include Amanita albocreata (ringless panther), Amanita atkinsoniana, Amanita citrina (false death cap), Amanita excelsa, Amanita flavorubescens, Amanita franchetii, Amanita longipes, Amanita onusta, Amanita rhopalopus, Amanita silvicola, Amanita sinicoflava, Amanita spreta, and Amanita volvata. Poisonous species include Amanita brunnescens, Amanita ceciliae, Amanita cokeri (Coker's amanita), Amanita crenulata, Amanita farinosa (eastern American floury amanita), Amanita frostiana, Amanita muscaria (fly agaric), Amanita pantherina (panther cap), and Amanita porphyria. =Deadly poisonous= Deadly poisonous species include Amanita abrupta, Amanita arocheae, Amanita bisporigera (eastern NA destroying angel), Amanita exitialis (Guangzhou destroying angel), Amanita magnivelaris, Amanita ocreata (western NA destroying angel), Amanita phalloides (death cap), Amanita proxima, Amanita smithiana, Amanita subjunquillea (East Asian death cap), Amanita verna (fool's mushroom), and Amanita virosa (European destroying angel). Psychoactive species Amanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric, contains the psychoactive compound ibotenic acid. = Amanita muscaria = Amanita muscaria was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A. muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A. muscaria was not practised by these peoples. = Amanita pantherina = Muscimol (also known as pantherine) is an isoxazole. Amanita pantherina is named after pantherine. Amanita pantherina contains the psychoactive compound muscimol, but is used as an entheogen much less often than its much more distinguishable relative A. muscaria. = Others = Other species identified as containing psychoactive substances include: * Amanita ** A. citrina ** A. gemmata ** Amanita pantherina var. abietum ** A. porphyria ** A. regalis ** A. strobiliformis * Tricholoma ** Tricholoma muscarium See also * Death cap * Destroying angel * List of Amanita species References =Sources= * External links * Rodham E.

They were a charter member of Major League Soccer (MLS) and played from 1996 to 2001. They played their home games at Tampa Stadium and then at Raymond James Stadium. The Mutiny were established in 1994 and were owned and operated by MLS throughout their existence. They were successful in their first years of play, winning the first MLS Supporters' Shield behind MLS MVP Carlos Valderrama and high-scoring forward Roy Lassiter, whose 27 goals in 1996 remained the MLS single-season record until 2018. However, the team drew low revenues and attendance and could not find a local ownership group to take over operations from the league. In 2002, MLS folded the Mutiny as well as its other Florida-based team, the Miami Fusion. History In 1994, newly established Major League Soccer announced it would place one of its charter franchises in the Tampa Bay Area. The region was seen as a potentially fertile market for soccer due to the success of the Tampa Bay Rowdies in the old North American Soccer League in the 1970s and 1980s. The Mutiny took the field in 1996 when the MLS began play. While the Mutiny have no connection to either Rowdies franchise, the team often payed tribute to the former Rowdies by wearing jerseys of their colors, and even wearing the logo of both the Tampa Bay Mutiny and Rowdies on the same shirt. The Mutiny were owned and operated by MLS along with two other teams, the Dallas Burn and the San Jose Clash, with the league hoping eventually sell the franchises to private local owners. The team managed strong signings in 1995, including Carlos Valderrama, Roy Lassiter, and Mart√≠n V√°squez. They were successful in their first two years, particularly in 1996, when they won the first Supporters' Shield with the best regular-season finish behind Most Valuable Player Carlos Valderrama and Golden Boot winner Roy Lassiter. The city of Tampa demolished Tampa Stadium in 1998, and the Mutiny moved to new Raymond James Stadium for the 1999 season with a much less favorable lease. The club was hampered by declining attendance and low revenues which were exacerbated by a lease agreement that which transferred most match day revenue to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, resulting in an inability to secure a local ownership group. By 2001, they drew an average attendance of under 11,000 per game, among the league's lowest. Faced with financial losses up to $2 million a year, MLS courted Malcolm Glazer and his family, owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League team, to purchase the Mutiny. The Glazers considered the deal but ultimately declined, leaving the league with no prospective owners willing to take over the team. MLS folded the Mutiny, as well as its other Florida-based team, the Miami Fusion, in 2002. The Glazers would purchase Manchester United in 2005.

A native of Berlin and a second-generation member of the Communist Party of Germany, Mielke was one of two triggermen in the 1931 murders of Berlin Police Captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. After learning that a witness had survived, Mielke escaped arrest by fleeing to the Soviet Union, where the NKVD recruited him. He was one of the key figures in the decimation of Moscow's German Communists during the Great PurgeJohn O. Koehler, The Stasi; The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police, page 51. as well as in the savage persecution of suspected anti-Stalinists in the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Following the end of World War II in 1945, Mielke returned to the Soviet Zone of Occupied Germany, which he helped organize into a Marxist-Leninist satellite state under the Socialist Unity Party (SED), later becoming head of the Stasi; according to John Koehler, he was \\"the longest serving secret police chief in the Soviet Bloc\\".Koehler (1999), page 72. The Stasi under Mielke has been called by historian Edward N. Peterson, the \\"most pervasive police state apparatus ever to exist on German soil\\".Peterson (2002), page 24. In a 1993 interview, Holocaust survivor and Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal has said that, if one considers only the oppression of their own people, the Stasi under Mielke \\"was much, much worse than the Gestapo\\".Koehler (1999), page 8. During the 1950s and 1960s Mielke led the process of forcibly forming collectivised farms from East Germany's family-owned farms, which sent a flood of refugees to West Germany. In response, Mielke oversaw the construction (1961) of the Berlin Wall and co- signed orders to fatally shoot all East Germans who attempted to leave the country. He also oversaw the establishment of pro-Soviet police states and paramilitary insurgencies in Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. In addition to his role as head of the Stasi, Mielke was also a General in the National People's Army (Nationale Volksarmee), and a member of the SED's ruling Politburo. Dubbed \\"The Master of Fear\\" () by the West German press, Mielke was one of the most powerful and most hated men in East Germany. After German reunification in 1990, Mielke was prosecuted (1992), convicted, and incarcerated (1993) for the 1931 murders of Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. Released from prison early due to ill health in 1995, he died in a Berlin nursing-home in 2000.  Early life  K√∂llnisches Gymnasium Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as \\"Red Wedding\\" due to many residents' Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as \\"a poor, uneducated woodworker,\\" and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). After his remarriage to \\"a seamstress,\\" the elder Mielke and his new wife joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany and remained members when it was renamed the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). His son Erich claimed \\"My younger brother Kurt and two sisters were Communist sympathisers.\\"Koehler (1999), p. 44. Despite his family's poverty, Erich Mielke was academically gifted enough to be awarded a free scholarship in the prestigious K√∂llnisches Gymnasium, but was expelled on 19 February 1929, for being \\"unable to meet the great demands of this school.\\"Koehler (1999), pages 44‚Äì45. While attending the Gymnasium, Mielke joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1925, and worked as a reporter for the communist newspaper Rote Fahne from 1928 to 1931. During the Weimar Republic, the KPD was the largest communist party in Europe and was seen as the \\"leading party\\" of the communist movement outside the Soviet Union.Ralf Hoffrogge / Norman LaPorte (eds.): Weimar Communism as Mass Movement 1918‚Äì1933, London: Lawrence & Wishart, p. 2 Under Ernst Th√§lmann's leadership, the KPD was completely obedient to Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, and from 1928 the Party was both funded and controlled by the Comintern in Moscow. Until the end of the Republic, the KPD viewed the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which dominated German politics between 1918 and 1931, as their mortal enemy. In keeping with Stalin's policy towards Social Democracy, the KPD considered all SPD members to be \\"social fascists\\". The KPD also believed that all other political parties were \\"fascist\\" and regarded itself as \\"the only anti-fascist Party\\" in Germany. Nevertheless, the KPD closely collaborated with the Nazi Party during the early 1930s and both Parties intended to replace the democratically elected government of the Weimar Republic with a totalitarian single party state. Soon after joining the Party, Mielke joined the KPD's paramilitary wing, or Parteiselbstschutz (\\"Party Self Defense Unit\\"). At the time, the Parteiselbstschutz in Berlin was commanded by KPD Reichstag Representatives Hans Kippenberger and Heinz Neumann. According to John Koehler, \\"Mielke was a special protege of Kippenberger's having taken to his paramilitary training with the enthusiasm of a Prussian Junker. World War I veterans taught the novices how to handle pistols, rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. This clandestine training was conducted in the sparsely populated, pastoral countryside surrounding Berlin. Mielke also pleased Kippenberger by being an exceptional student in classes on the arts of conspiratorial behavior and espionage, taught by comrades who had studied at the secret M-school of the GRU in Moscow.\\"Koehler (1999), page 38. According to John Koehler, members of the Parteiselbstschutz \\"served as bouncers at Party meetings and specialized in cracking heads during street battles with political enemies.\\" Besides the ruling SPD and it's paramilitary Reichsbanner forces, the arch-enemies of the Parteiselbstschutz were the Stahlhelm, which was the armed wing of the Monarchist German National People's Party (DVNP), Trotskyites, and \\"radical nationalist parties.\\" According to Koehler, the KPD's Selbstschutz men \\"always carried a Stahlrute, two steel springs that telescoped into a tube seven inches long, which when extended became a deadly, fourteen-inch weapon. Not to be outdone by the Nazis, these street-fighters were often armed with pistols as well.\\"The Stasi, p. 38. In a 1931 biography written for the Cadre Division of the Comintern,Koehler (1999), pages 43‚Äì44. Mielke recalled, \\"We took care of all kinds of work; terror acts, protecting illegal demonstrations and meetings, arms-trafficking, etc. The last work, which was accomplished by a Comrade and myself, was the B√ºlowplatz Affair\\" ().\\"Der Man der alle liebte\\", by Die Zeit, 15 November 2007. (In German). B√ºlowplatz murders =Planning= Walter Ulbricht, mastermind of the Anlauf-Lenck murders, General Secretary of the East German SED (1949‚Äì1971). Karl-Liebknecht-Haus, B√ºlowplatz the KPD's headquarters from 1926 to 1933. Today it is the Berlin headquarters of the Left Party. During the last days of the Weimar Republic, the KPD had a policy of assassinating two Berlin police officers in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police.Koehler (1999), page 33. On 2 August 1931, KPD Members of the Reichstag Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger received a dressing down from Walter Ulbricht, the Party's leader in the Berlin- Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger's failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht snarled, \\"At home in Saxony we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.\\"John Koehler, The Stasi, p. 36. Enraged by Ulbricht's words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate Paul Anlauf, the forty-two- year-old Captain of the Berlin Police's Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed Schweinebacke, or \\"Pig Face\\" by the KPD. According to John Koehler, \\"Of all the policemen in strife-torn Berlin, the reds hated Anlauf the most. His precinct included the area around KPD headquarters, which made it the most dangerous in the city. The captain almost always led the riot squads that broke up illegal rallies of the Communist Party.\\"The Stasi, p. 36. On the morning of Sunday 9 August 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a last briefing to the hit-team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Mielke and Erich Ziemer were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, Max Matern gave a Luger pistol to fellow lookout Max Thunert and said, \\"Now we're getting serious... We're going to give Schweinebacke something to remember us by.\\"The Stasi, pp. 38‚Äì39. Kippenberger then asked Mielke and Ziemer, \\"Are you sure that you are ready to shoot Schweinebacke?\\"John Koehler, The Stasi, p. 39. Mielke responded that he had seen Captain Anlauf many times during police searches of Party Headquarters. Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire B√ºlow-Platz. He further reminded them that Captain Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, whom the KPD had nicknamed, Hussar. Kippenberger concluded, \\"When you spot Schweinebacke and Hussar, you take care of them.\\"The Stasi, p. 39. Mielke and Ziemer were informed that, after the assassinations were completed, a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions. That evening, Captain Anlauf was lured to B√ºlow-Platz by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the Prussian Parliament. According to John Koehler, \\"As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-plebiscite campaign. At one point in this particular campaign, Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels even shared a speaker's platform with KPD agitator Walter Ulbricht. Both parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.\\"The Stasi, pp. 39‚Äì40. =Murder at the Babylon Cinema= The \\"Babylon Cinema,\\" the site of the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck, as it appears today. The funeral of Captains Anlauf and Lenck was attended by thousands of Berliners. At eight o'clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer waited in a doorway as Captain Anlauf, Sergeant Willig, and Captain Franz Lenck walked toward the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of B√ºlowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra√üe. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream, \\"Schweinebacke!\\"The Stasi, p. 41. As Captain Anlauf turned toward the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Sergeant Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his Luger pistol and fired a full magazine at the assailants. Captain Franz Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over and cradled the head of Captain Anlauf, who had taken two bullets in the neck. As his life drained away, the Captain gasped, \\"Wiedersehen... Gruss...\\" (\\"So Long... Goodbye...\\"). Meanwhile, Mielke and Ziemer made their escape by running into the theater and out an emergency exit. They tossed their pistols over a fence, where they were later found by Homicide Detectives from the elite Mordkommission. Mielke and Ziemer then returned to their homes.Koehler (1999), pages 41‚Äì42. According to Koehler, \\"Back at B√ºlowplatz, the killings had triggered a major police action. At least a thousand officers poured into the square, and a bloody street battle ensued. Rocks and bricks were hurled from the rooftops. Communist gunmen fired indiscriminately from the roofs of surrounding apartment houses. As darkness fell, police searchlights illuminated the buildings. Using megaphones, officers shouted, 'Clear the streets! Move away from the windows! We are returning fire!' By now the rabble had fled the square, but shooting continued as riot squads combed the tenements, arresting hundreds of residents suspected of having fired weapons. The battle lasted until one o'clock the next morning. In addition to the two police officers, the casualties included one Communist who died of a gunshot wound and seventeen others who were seriously wounded.\\"Koehler (1999), page 42. Captain Anlauf's wife had died three weeks earlier of kidney failure.Koehler (1999), page 41. The KPD's murder of Captain Anlauf thus left their three daughters as orphans. The Captain's oldest daughter was forced to drastically rush her planned wedding in order to keep her sisters from being put in an orphanage.Koehler (1999), page 415. Note 7. Captain Franz Lenck was survived by his wife. Senior Sergeant Max Willig was hospitalized for fourteen weeks, but made a full recovery and returned to active duty. In recognition for Willig's courage, the Berlin Police promoted him to Lieutenant.Koehler (1999), page 415. Note 6. After the murders, the act was celebrated at the Lichtenberger Hof, a favorite beer hall of the Rotfrontk√§mpferbund, where Mielke boasted: \\"Today we celebrate a job that I pulled!\\" () =Fugitive= \\"Wanted\\" poster, September 1933. \\"Help with the Search for the Red Murderers.\\" Mielke is top right. According to John Koehler, \\"Kippenberger was alarmed when word reached him that Sergeant Willig had survived the shooting. Not knowing whether the sergeant could talk and identify the attackers, Kippenberger was taking no chances. He directed a runner to summon Mielke and Ziemer to his apartment at 74 Bellermannstrasse, only a few minutes walk from where the two lived. When the assassins arrived, Kippenberger told them the news and ordered them to leave Berlin at once. The parliamentarian's wife Thea, an unemployed schoolteacher and as staunch a Communist Party member as her husband, shepherded the young murderers to the Belgian border. Agents of the Communist International (Comintern) in the port city of Antwerp supplied them with money and forged passports. Aboard a merchant ship, they sailed for Leningrad. When their ship docked, they were met by another Comintern representative, who escorted them to Moscow.\\"The Stasi, pages 42‚Äì43. Beginning in 1932, Mielke attended the Comintern's Military Political school under the alias Paul Bach. He later graduated from the Lenin School shortly before being recruited into the OGPU. =Trial= German policemen lay a wreath on the monument to Captains Anlauf and Lenck during the Day of the German Police, 16 January 1937. Despite the fact that Captains Anlauf and Lenck were members of the SPD, the Nazi salute is given by many of those present. In 1951, Mielke ordered the demolition of the monument. According to Koehler, \\"In mid-March 1933, while attending the Lenin School, Mielke received word from his OGPU sponsors that Berlin police had arrested Max Thunert, one of the conspirators in the Anlauf and Lenck murders. Within days, fifteen other members of the assassination team were in custody. Mielke had to wait six more months before the details of the police action against his Berlin comrades reached Moscow. On 14 September 1933, Berlin newspapers reported that all fifteen had confessed to their roles in the murders. Arrest warrants were issued for ten others who had fled, including Mielke, Ziemer, Ulbricht, Kippenberger, and Neumann.\\"Koehler (1999), page 45. Koehler also stated, \\"Defenders of Mielke later claimed that confessions had been obtained under torture by the Nazi Gestapo. However, all suspects were in the custody of the regular Berlin city criminal investigation bureau, most of whose detectives were SPD members. Some of the suspects had been nabbed by Nazi SA men and probably beaten before they were turned over to police. In the 1993 trial of Mielke, the court gave the defense the benefit of the doubt and threw out a number of suspect confessions.\\"Koehler, The Stasi, page 416. On 19 June 1934, the 15 conspirators were convicted of first degree murder. The three deemed most culpable, Michael Klause, Max Matern, and Friedrich Br√∂de were sentenced to death. Their co-defendants received sentences ranging from nine months to fifteen years incarceration at hard labor. Klause's sentence was commuted to life in prison based upon his cooperation. Br√∂de hanged himself in his cell. As a result, only Matern was left to be executed by beheading on 22 May 1935. Matern was subsequently glorified as a martyr by KPD and East German propaganda. Ziemer was officially killed in action while fighting on the Republican-side during the Spanish Civil War. Mielke, however, would not face trial for the murders until 1993.  Career in Soviet intelligence  =The Great Terror= Picture of Felix Dzerzhinsky during a 1936 parade in Red Square. Although Moscow's German Communist community was decimated during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge,Stephane Coutois, et al. (1999), The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression, Harvard University Press. Pages 301‚Äì303. Mielke survived and was promoted. In a handwritten autobiography prepared after World War II, Mielke recalled, \\"During my stay in the S.U. (Soviet Union), I participated in all Party discussions of the K.P.D. and also in the problems concerning the establishment of socialism and in the trials against the traitors and enemies of the S.U.\\" Among the German communists executed as a result of these \\"discussions\\" were Mielke's former mentors Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger. Mielke further recalled, \\"I was a guest on the honor grandstand of Red Square during the May Day and October Revolution parades. I became acquainted with many comrades of the Federation of World Communist Parties and the War Council of the Special Commission of the Comintern. I will never forget my meeting with Comrade Dimitrov, the Chairman of the Comintern, whom I served as an aide together with another comrade. I saw Comrade Stalin during all demonstrations at Red Square, especially when I stood on the grandstand. I mention these meetings because all these comrades are our models and teachers for our work.\\"Koehler (1999), page 52. During his time in the USSR, Mielke also developed a lifelong reverence for Felix Dzerzhinsky, the Polish aristocrat who founded the Soviet secret police. Mielke also began an equally permanent habit of calling himself a Chekist.Koehler (1999), page 31. In a citation written decades later, Mielke described his philosophy of life, \\"The Chekist is the political combatant. He is the loyal son of... the workers' class. He stands at the head of the battle to strengthen the power of our workers' and peasants' state.\\"Koehler (1999), page 66. =Spanish Civil War= The flag of the International Brigades was the Spanish Republican flag with the three-pointed star of the Popular Front in the center From 1936 to 1939, Mielke served in Spain as an operative of the Servicio de Investigaci√≥n Militar, the political police of the Second Spanish Republic.John Koehler, \\"The Stasi,\\" p. 48. While attached to the staff of, \\"veteran GRU agent,\\"Koehler (1999), page 55. and future Stasi minister Wilhelm Zaisser, Mielke used the alias Fritz Leissner. Bernd Kaufmann, the director of the Stasi's espionage school later said, \\"The Soviets trusted Mielke implicitly. He earned his spurs in Spain.\\" At the time, the S.I.M. was heavily staffed by agents of the Soviet NKVD, whose Spanish rezident was General Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov. According to author Donald Rayfield, \\"Stalin, Yezhov, and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Koltsov were open to infection by the heresies, especially Trotsky's, prevalent among the Republic's supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Franco. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.\\"Donald Rayfield, Stalin and his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him, Random House, 2004. pp. 362‚Äì363. In a 1991 interview,Koehler (1999), pages 416‚Äì417. Walter Janka, a fellow German communist exile and company commander in the International Brigade, recalled his encounters with Mielke. During the winter of 1936, Janka was summoned by the SIM and interrogated by Mielke. Mielke demanded to know why Janka had voluntarily traveled to Spain rather than being assigned there by the Party. When he told Mielke to get lost, the SIM demoted Janka to the ranks and then expelled him from the International Brigade. Years later, Janka recalled, \\"While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the Fascists, Mielke served in the rear, shooting Trotskyites and Anarchists.\\" Upon the defeat of the Spanish Republic, Mielke fled across the Pyrenees Mountains to France, where he was interned at Camp de Rivesaltes, Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. Mielke, however, managed to send a message to exiled KPD members and, in May 1939, escaped to Belgium. Although the Public Prosecutor of Berlin learned of Mielke's presence and filed for his extradition, the Belgian Government refused to comply, regarding the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as \\"a political crime.\\"Wilfriede Otto, Erich Mielke. Biographie. Aufstieg und Fall eines Tschekisten. Dietz-Verlag, Berlin 2000, . Pages 82‚Äì86. The NKVD and the SIM's witch hunt for both real and imagined anti-Stalinists had serious consequences. It horrified numerous Pro-Soviet Westerners who had been witnesses, including John Dos Passos, Arthur Koestler and George Orwell, and caused them to permanently turn against the USSR.Diggins, John Patrick, \\"'Organization is Death': John Dos Passos,\\" and \\"Visions of Order: Dos Passos,\\" in Up From Communism, 1975, Columbia University Press, then Harper & Row, pp. 74‚Äì117, and pp. 233‚Äì268. Mielke's belief that anti-Soviet Marxists had collaborated with Franco and stabbed the Republic in the back continued to shape his attitudes for the rest of his life. In a 1982 speech before a group of senior Stasi officers, he said, \\"We are not immune from villains among us. If I knew of any already, they wouldn't live past tomorrow. Short shrift. It's because I'm a Humanist, that I'm of this view.\\"Funder (2003), page 57. In the same speech, Mielke also said, \\"All this blithering over to execute or not to execute, for the death penalty or against-- all rot, Comrades. Execute! And, when necessary, without a court judgment.\\" =World War II= Belarusian partisans in the forest near Polotsk, Byelorussian SSR September 1943. During World War II, Mielke's movements remain mysterious. In a biography written after the war, he claimed to have infiltrated Organisation Todt under the alias Richard Hebel,The Stasi, page 51. but historian John O. Koehler considers this unlikely. Koehler admits, however, \\"Mielke's exploits must have been substantial. By war's end, he had been decorated with the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Great Patriotic War First Class, and twice with the Order of Lenin. It is likely that he served as an NKVD agent, at least part of the time with guerrilla units behind German lines, for he knew all the partisan songs by heart and sang them in faultless Russian.\\"The Stasi, page 50. Occupied Germany = Komissariat-5= Former Soviet military and NKGB Headquarters in Karlshorst. Now the German-Russian Museum. In April 1945, Mielke returned to the Soviet Zone of Occupied Germany aboard a special Soviet aircraft that also carried fellow German Communists Walter Ulbricht, Wilhelm Zaisser, Ernst Wollweber, and many of the future leaders of the East Germany.Koehler (1999), page 50. That same month, Mielke's future handler, NKGB General Ivan Serov, travelled to Germany from Warsaw and, from his headquarters in the Berlin suburb of Karlshorst, divided the Soviet Zone into \\"Operative Sectors.\\" Anne Applebaum (2012),Irom Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956, pages 80-81. On 10 July 1945, Marshal Georgy Zhukov signed SMA Order No. 2, which legalized the re-establishment of \\"anti-fascist\\" political parties like the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).Koehler (1999), page 51. On 15 July 1945, Mielke walked into the KPD's headquarters and volunteered his services. In an autobiography written for the KPD, Mielke confessed his involvement in the 1931 murders of Berlin Police Captains Anlauf and Lenck, but lied when he wrote that he had been tried for the murders, found guilty, and sentenced to death in absentia. The reality was that Mielke's, \\"name was mentioned in the 1934 trials but he was never tried.\\" In the same memoir, Mielke concealed his past and present involvement with the NKVD and NKGB. He wrote that he had fought on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, but claimed to have been released from the French internment camps and to have worked in Belgium for an underground Communist newspaper under the code name \\"Gaston.\\" He also claimed to have infiltrated Organization Todt. According to Koehler, \\"As might be expected, Mielke's account of his past was approved by the Soviets. Had Serov not been part of the conspiracy, Mielke would have been instantly arrested or at least subjected to an intense internal investigation because of his membership in the Nazi Organisation Todt, which used thousands of slave laborers. But he was cleared in record time and by the end of June the Soviets had installed him as a station commander of the newly formed Volkspolizei (Vopo), the People's Police.\\" On 16 August 1947, Serov ordered the creation of Kommissariat 5, the first German political police since the defeat of Nazi Germany.John Koehler, The Stasi, page 52. According to Anne Applebaum, however, not everyone approved of the plan. In Moscow, Soviet Interior Minister Viktor Abakumov argued that a new secret police force would be demonized by Western governments and the media, which would paint the K-5 as a, \\"new Gestapo.\\" Furthermore, Abakumov, like, Stalin, intensely distrusted German Communists and alleged that there, \\"were not enough German cadres who have been thoroughly checked.\\" Even so, recruitment into the K-5 began almost immediately. It is possible that, as Norman Naimark suspects, that the NKGB had realized that their officers poor knowledge of the German language was causing massive resentment. Anne Applebaum (2012),Irom Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956, page 81. Wilhelm Zaisser, who had been Mielke's commanding officer in Republican Spain, was appointed the K-5's head. Mielke was installed as his deputy. According to John Koehler, \\"The K-5 was essentially an arm of the Soviet secret police. Its agents were carefully selected veteran German communists who had survived the Nazi-era in Soviet exile or in concentration camps and prisons. Their task was to track down Nazis and anti-communists, including hundreds of members of the Social Democratic Party. Mielke and his fellow bloodhounds performed this task with ruthless precision. The number of arrests became so great that the regular prisons could not hold them. Thus, Serov ordered the establishment or re- opening of eleven concentration camps, including the former Nazi death camps of Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen.\\"Koehler, The Stasi, page 52. According to Anne Applebaum, \\"One of the few documents from that era to survive (most were removed by the KGB or perhaps destroyed, in 1989 or before) mentions a departmental training meeting and included a list of attendees. Topping the list is a group of Soviet advisers. In this sense, K-5 did resemble the political police in the rest of Eastern Europe: as in Hungary, Poland, and the USSR itself, this new political police force was initially extra-governmental, operating outside the ordinary rule of law.\\" Anne Applebaum (2012),Irom Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe 1944-1956, page 81. According to Edward N. Peterson, \\"Not surprisingly, K-5 acquired a reputation as bad as that of Stalin's secret police and worse than that of the Gestapo. At least with the Nazis, albeit fanatically racist, their victims did not suddenly disappear into the GULAG.\\"Peterson (2002), pages 19‚Äì20. =The Amalgamation= Communist Wilhelm Pieck and Social Democrat Otto Grotewohl when their parties merged in 1946. Despite the K-5's mass arrests of members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet Zone, the number of SPD members continued to grow. By March 1946, SPD members outnumbered KPD members by more than 100,000. Fearing that they would lose the elections scheduled for the autumn, the leadership of the KPD asked for and received Stalin's permission to merge the two Parties. When the SPD's leadership agreed only to schedule a vote for the rank and file to decide, permission was denied by the Soviet occupation authorities. The K-5 then began mass arrests of SPD members who refused to support the merger. On 22 April 1946, the remaining leaders of the SPD in the Soviet Zone announced that they had united with the KPD to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The SPD in the western zones of Occupied Germany responded by forming the SPD East Bureau in order to support and finance those Social Democrats who refused to accept the merger. Those who joined or worked with the East Bureau were, however, in serious danger of arrest by the K-5 and trial by Soviet military tribunals. By 1950, more than 5,000 SPD members and sympathisers had been imprisoned in the Soviet Zone or transferred to the GULAG. More than 400 were either executed or died during their imprisonments.Koehler (1999), pages 126‚Äì127. John Koehler has written that, prior to the spring of 1946, many Germans in the Soviet Zone, \\"merely shrugged at the wave of arrests, believing that the victims were former Nazi officials and war criminals.\\" But then came the mass arrests of Social Democrats who opposed the merger, who, \\"were joined by people who had been denounced for making anti-communist or anti-Soviet remarks, among their number hundreds who were as young as fourteen years. Although these arrests were made by Germans purporting to be officials of the criminal police, the existence of the K-5 political police eventually was exposed. Mielke, meanwhile, had risen to the post of vice-president of the German Administration for Interior Affairs ‚Äì the equivalent of the NKVD ‚Äì and continued his manipulations from behind the scenes.\\"Koehler (1999), page 53. =Investigation= The Kammergericht In January 1947, two retired Berlin policemen recognized Mielke at an official function. Informing the head of the criminal police in West Berlin, the policemen demanded that Mielke be arrested and prosecuted for the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck.Koehler, The Stasi, page 53. Wilhelm K√ºhnast, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin, was immediately informed and ordered a search of the Kammergericht archives. To his astonishment, the files of the 1931 murders had survived the wartime bombing of Germany. Finding ample evidence of Mielke's involvement, K√ºhnast ordered the arrest of the communist policeman. According to John Koehler, \\"At that time, the city administration, including the police, was under the control of the Allied Control Commission, which consisted of U.S., British, French, and Soviet military officers. All actions by city officials, including the judiciary, were to be reported to the Commission. The Soviet representative alerted the MGB. Action was swift. Marshal Vasily Sokolovsky, who had replaced Zhukov, protested, and his representatives at the Commission launched a vicious campaign to discredit K√ºhnast.\\" The Soviet representatives falsely claimed that K√ºhnast, a jurist with an impeccable anti-Nazi record, had been an official of Roland Freisler's People's Court.Koehler, The Stasi, pages 53‚Äì54. Taking the Soviets at their word, the Western Allies removed K√ºhnast from his position and placed him under house arrest. During the Berlin airlift, K√ºhnast fled from his home in East Berlin and was granted political asylum in the American Zone.Koehler, The Stasi, page 54. Meanwhile, the Soviet authorities confiscated all documents relating to the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. According to Koehler, \\"The Soviets handed the court records to Mielke. Instead of destroying the incriminating papers, he locked them in his private safe, where they were found when his home was searched in 1990. They were used against him in his trial for murder.\\"Koehler (1999), page 417. = Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission = In 1948, Mielke was appointed as security chief of the German Economic Commission (), the precursor to the future East German government. Mielke's task was to investigate the theft and sale of state property on the black market. He was also charged with intercepting the growing number of refugees fleeing to the French, British, and American Zones. Those his security forces caught while attempting to defect were used as slave labor in the uranium mines that were providing raw material for the Soviet atomic bomb project.Koehler (1999), page 54. German Democratic Republic =Independence= In 1949, the Soviet Military Administration ceded its legal functions to the newly created German Democratic Republic. On 14 January 1950, Marshal Vasili Chuikov announced that all Soviet \\"internment camps\\" on German soil had been closed. Soon after, the DWK was absorbed into the newly created Ministry for State Security, which East Germans immediately dubbed the \\"Stasi\\". With the approval of the Soviets, Mielke's commanding officer from Spain and in the K5, Wilhelm Zaisser, was appointed as the Stasi's head. Mielke was appointed to his staff with the rank of State Secretary. Mielke was also granted a seat in the SED's ruling Politburo. According to John Koehler, \\"In the five years since the end of World War II, the Soviets and their vassals had arrested between 170,000 and 180,000 Germans. Some 160,000 had passed through the concentration camps, and of these about 65,000 had died, 36,000 had been shipped to the Soviet Gulag, and another 46,000 had been freed.\\" In 1949, as a response to the remilitarization of East Germany and the Soviet blockade of West Berlin, the United States, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Portugal formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. In 1950, as a response to the outbreak of the Korean War, West Germany was also permitted to join NATO, which was then upgraded into a military alliance.Koehler (1999), pages 57‚Äì58. According to Koehler, however, \\"As the Cold War intensified, living conditions in Soviet- occupied East Germany showed little improvement beyond the postwar level of bare subsistence. The new government of the DDR ‚Äì a mere puppet of the Kremlin ‚Äì relied more and more on the Stasi to quell discontent among factory workers and farmers. Ulbricht, claiming that the social unrest was fomented by capitalist agents, once ordered Mielke to personally visit one large plant and 'arrest four or five such agents' as an example to the others. The Stasi deputy 'discovered' the agents in record time.\\"Koehler (1999), page 58. =The Field show trials= Also in 1949, Noel Field, an American citizen who had spied for the NKVD from inside the U.S. State Department, the Office of Strategic Services, and the CIA, fled from his posting in Switzerland to Communist Czechoslovakia after his cover was blown by fellow mole Whittaker Chambers. On 11 May 1949, the Czechoslovakian secret police, or StB, in obedience to a direct order from KGB chief Lavrenti Beria, arrested Field in Prague. Field was then handed over to the Hungarian √ÅVO. After his interrogation in Budapest, Fields was used as a witness at show trials of senior Soviet Bloc Communists who, like L√°szl√≥ Rajk and Rudolf Sl√°nsk√Ω, stood accused of having spied for the United States. The real reason for the trials was to replace homegrown Communists in Eastern Europe with those who would be blindly loyal to Joseph Stalin and to blame the division of Germany on the intrigues of U.S. intelligence. At the Rajk show trial, the prosecutor declared, \\"Noel Field, one of the leaders of American espionage, specialized in recruiting spies from among left-wing elements.\\" In August 1950, six senior SED members, including Willi Kreikemeyer, the director of Deutsche Reichsbahn and head of Berliner Rundfunk, were accused of \\"special connections with Noel Field, the American spy.\\" All were either imprisoned or shot. John Koehler writes, \\"Similar purges were conducted in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, where Field appeared as a witness in show trials that resulted in some death sentences. The Soviets simply distrusted all Communists who had sought exile in the West. All the while, Mielke remained untouched and continued to serve as the deputy secret police chief. His survival reinforced the belief that he had spent the war years in the Soviet Union instead of France and Belgium as he had claimed in the 1945 questionnaire.\\" In June 1950, Erica Wallach, Noel Field's adopted daughter, decided to search for him. From Paris, she telephoned Leo Bauer, the editor-in-chief of Berliner Rundfunk. The call was monitored by agents of the Soviet Ministry for Internal Affairs, and Bauer's handler instructed him to invite Mrs. Wallach to East Berlin, where she was immediately arrested. Mielke personally interrogated her and, at one point, offered Mrs. Wallach immediate release if she named the members of her fictitious spy network. She was condemned to death by a Soviet military tribunal in East Berlin and shipped to the Lubianka prison in Moscow for her execution. After Joseph Stalin's death in on 5 March 1953, Erica Wallach's sentence was reduced to hard labor in Vorkuta, a region of the Gulag located above the Arctic Circle. She was released during the Khrushchev thaw in October 1955. At first, she was unable to join her husband and daughters in the U.S. because of the U.S. State Department's concern over her former membership in the Communist Party of Germany. It took the personal intervention of CIA Director Allen Dulles to reunite Erica Wallach with her family in 1957. Wallach's memoir of her experiences, Light at Midnight, was published in 1967. =The Death of Stalin= Stalin's casket on howitzer carriage draught by horses, caught on camera by US assistant army attach√© Major Martin Manhoff from the American embassy balcony After Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin died inside his Kuntsevo Dacha on 5 March 1953, the Central Committee of the East German Socialist Unity Party met in a special session and eulogized the dictator as the \\"great friend of Germany who was always an advisor of and help to our people.\\" Two months later, on 5 May 1953, the SED's General Secretary, Walter Ulbricht, and the rest of the leadership celebrated the 135th birthday of Karl Marx by increasing work quotas by 10%. They also decided to rename Chemnitz Karl-Marx-Stadt and to institute the Order of Karl Marx as the GDR's highest award.Koehler (1999), pages 58‚Äì59. Two weeks later, Mielke accused \\"a group of Party officials\\" of \\"plotting against the leadership\\", which \\"resulted in more expulsions from the Politburo and the Central Committee.\\" =The East German uprising of 1953= A Soviet tank rolling into East Berlin during the East German uprising of 1953. Meanwhile, discontent among factory workers about the 10% increase of work quotas without a corresponding wage hike boiled over. On 16 June 1953, nearly one hundred construction workers gathered before work for a protest meeting at Stalinallee, in East Berlin. Words spread rapidly to other construction sites and hundreds of men and women joined the rally, which marched to the House of Ministries. The protesters chanted slogans for five hours, demanding to speak to Walter Ulbricht and Otto Grotewohl. Only Heavy Industry Minister Fritz Selbmann and Professor Robert Havemann, president of the GDR Peace Council, emerged. Their speech, however, was answered with jeers and the Ministers retreated into the heavily armed building. The regular and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei were summoned from their barracks, but made no move to attack the protesters, who returned to Stalinallee, where a general strike was called.Koehler (1999), page 59. Following West Germany's Federal Minister for All-German Questions Jakob Kaiser's admonition in a late night broadcast to East Germans to shy away from provocations, RIAS, starting with its 11 pm news broadcast, and from then on in hourly intermissions, repeated the workers' demand to continue the strike the next day, calling specifically for all East Berliners to participate in a demo at 7am on the 17th at Strausberger Platz.Ostermann, Christian F.; Malcolm Byrne. Uprising in East Germany, 1953. Central European University Press. Page 163 The following day, 17 June 1953, more that 100,000 protesters took to the streets of East Berlin. More than 400,000 protesters also took to the streets in other cities and towns throughout the German Democratic Republic. Everywhere, the demands were the same: free elections by secret ballot. Outside of Berlin, the main centres of the protests included the industrial region around Halle, Merseburg, and Bitterfeld, as well as middle-size towns like Jena, G√∂rlitz, and Brandenburg. No more than 25,000 people participated in strikes and demonstrations in Leipzig, but there were 32,000 in Magdeburg, 43,000 in Dresden, 53,000 in Potsdam ‚Äì and in Halle, a figure close to 100,000. In West Berlin, the American radio station RIAS and several other West German stations reported on the protests and on plans for a general strike. As East Germans listened to the broadcasts, 267,000 workers at State-owned plants in 304 cities and towns joined the general strike. In 24 towns, outraged East Germans stormed the Stasi's prisons and freed between 2,000 and 3,0000 political prisoners. In response to orders, the Soviet Occupation Forces, the Stasi and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei went on the attack. Bloody street battles ensued and hundreds of policemen defected to the side of the protesters. Both police and Stasi stations were overrun and some government offices were sacked. The Party leadership retreated into a fortified compound in the Pankow district of East Berlin. At noon, the Soviet authorities terminated all tram and metro traffic into the Eastern sector and all but closed the sector borders to West Berlin to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the city centre. An hour later, they declared martial law in East Berlin.Ostermann, 164 The repression took place outside East Berlin police HQ ‚Äì where Soviet tanks opened fire on \\"the insurgents\\". According to John Koehler, \\"... by late afternoon, Soviet tanks accompanied by Infantry and MVD troops had rolled into East Berlin and other cities in the Soviet Zone. This made the people even angrier. At Berlin's Potsdamer Platz, which bordered on the American Sector, irate protesters ignored machine gun fire and the menacing barrels of tank guns. They ripped cobblestones from the streets and hurled them at the tanks.\\"Koehler (1999), pages 59‚Äì60. Fighting between the Red Army (and later GDR police) and the demonstrators persisted into the afternoon and night. In some cases, the tanks and the soldiers fired directly into the crowds. Overnight, the Soviets (and the Stasi) started to arrest hundreds of people. Ultimately, up to 10,000 people were detained and at least 20, probably as many as 40, people were executed, including Red Army soldiers who refused to obey orders. With the SED leadership effectively paralysed at the Soviet headquarters in Karlshorst, control of the city passed to the Soviets.Ostermann, 169 Deutsche Bundespost Berlin stamp In in honor of the uprising, West Germany established 17 June as a national holiday, called Day of German Unity. The extension of the Unter den Linden boulevard to the west of the Brandenburg Gate, formerly called Charlottenburger Chaussee, was also renamed Stra√üe des 17. Juni (\\"17 June Street\\") in honor of the uprising. According to John Koehler, \\"Provisional prison camps were set up to hold the thousands of Stasi victims. Nearly 1,500 persons were sentenced in secret trials to long prison terms. On 24 June, Mielke issued a terse announcement that one Stasi officer, nineteen demonstrators, and two bystanders had been killed during the uprising. He did not say how many were victims of official lynching. The numbers of the wounded were given as 191 policemen, 126 demonstrators, and 61 bystanders.\\"Koehler (1999), page 60. Also according to Koehler, \\"Calm returned to the streets of the Soviet Zone, yet escapes to the West continued at a high rate. Of the 331,390 who fled in 1953, 8,000 were members of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, the barracked people's police units, which were actually the secret cadre of the future East German Army. Also among the escapees were 2,718 members and candidates of the SED, the ruling Party.\\" The Khrushchev thaw =Purges= Svetlana, and Nestor Lakoba (obscured) Alarmed by the uprising, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union and head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, personally travelled from Moscow to East Berlin. He conferred with Stasi Minister Wilhelm Zaisser and with Mielke, his deputy, both of whom he had known since the early 1930s. During both conversations, Beria demanded to know why the Stasi had failed to recognize the extreme discontent of the population and inform the Party leadership, which could then have prevented the uprising by taking extremely repressive measures in advance. Both Zaisser and Mielke answered Beria's questions circumspectly, and were accordingly left in their posts. In response to the uprising, Beria decided to replace several hundred MVD officers, including Major General Ivan Fadeykin, the MVD resident of East Germany. The Stasi, according to John Koehler, \\"generally remained untouched except for the arrests and dismissals, for dereliction of duty, of a handful of officers in the provinces. One high- ranking Stasi officer shot himself.\\" Following Beria's return to Moscow, however, he was arrested on 26 June 1953, in a coup d'√©tat led by Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Beria was tried on charges of 357 counts of rape and high treason. He was sentenced to death and shot by Red Army Colonel-General Pavel Batitsky on 23 December 1953. In an interview to Neues Deutschland, the official party newspaper of East Germany, on 30 June 1953, the Party's Minister of Justice, Max Fechner, declared that, \\"illegal arrests,\\" had been made and that being a member of a strike committee or suspicion of being a ringleader was not in itself grounds for arrest and conviction. Meanwhile, when the East German Politburo met on 8 July, it seemed that Ulbricht would be deposed as Party General Secretary. Zaisser conceded that the whole Politburo was responsible for the \\"accelerated construction of socialism\\" and of the subsequent fallout. But he also added that to leave Ulbricht as Premier, \\"would be opposed catastrophic for the New Course\\".Ostermann, 168 By the end of the meeting, only two Politburo members still supported Ulbricht's leadership: Free German Youth League chief Erich Honecker and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision then and there with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled for later that month. Meanwhile, Mielke informed a Party commission looking for scapegoats that his boss, Stasi Minister Wilhelm Zaisser, was calling for secret negotiations with West Germany and that, \\"he believed the Soviet Union would abandon the DDR.\\"Koehler (1999), page 61. By late July, Ulbricht was completely certain that he had the support of the new Soviet Premier, Nikita Khrushchev. Therefore, he expelled his main opponents, Zaisser, Hernstadt and Ackermann, from the Politburo, and thus strengthened his position further.Ostermann, 179 SED Minister of Justice Max Fechner was personally arrested by Mielke and replaced by Hilde Benjamin, who was known to East German citizens as \\"Red Hilde\\", \\"The Red Freisler,\\" and as, \\"The Red Guillotine,\\" for her role as a judge in the SED's show trials. Fechner was convicted of being, \\"an enemy of the Party and the State,\\" and served three years in Bautzen Prison. Wilhelm Zaisser was replaced as head of the Stasi by Ernst Wollweber and Mielke remained on staff as his deputy.  Tenure as Stasi head  Erich Mielke's Office, Stasi Museum, Berlin. Mielke headed the Stasi from 1957 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. There was, under the East German system, no provision for parliamentary oversight. However, starting in 1971 Mielke was required to provide a detailed intelligence briefing to party secretary Erich Honecker each Tuesday, directly following the weekly Politburo meeting. (Before 1971, under Walter Ulbricht, Mielke was not involved in routine intelligence briefings to the leadership which, instead, were provided directly to Ulbricht by Intelligence Chief Markus Wolf.) =Internal discipline= During his tenure, Mielke enforced \\"political and personal discipline reminiscent of the early French Foreign Legion\\". New recruits were required to take a solemn oath pledging \\"to fight alongside the state security organs of all socialist countries against all enemies of socialism\\" on pain of \\"the severest punishment under the Republic's laws and the contempt of the workers.\\"Koehler (1999), page 147. Recruits were also required to sign a security pledge vowing never to make unauthorized visits to any \\"capitalist countries\\" and to report on any members of their families who did so.Koehler (1999), pages 147‚Äì148. Violations of the oath resulted in expulsion from the Stasi and blacklisting from all but the most menial jobs. Serious violations were tried before secret tribunals and led an estimated 200 Stasi agents to be shot. Colonel Rainer Wiegand once said, \\"There was only one way to leave the MfS without being haunted for the rest of your life. You either retired or you died.\\"Koehler (1999), page 148. =Domestic activities= Erich Mielke, 1959. Under Erich Mielke's leadership, the Stasi employed 85,000 full-time domestic spies and 170,000 civilian informants () (IMs). East Germans coined a term to describe the Stasi's pervasive surveillance of the population \\"All-Covered\\" (). For this reason, Anna Funder has referred to East Germany as, \\"the most perfected surveillance state of all time.\\" According to John Koehler, \\"...the Stasi's tentacles probed every aspect of life. Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants. Without exception, one tenant in every building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the Volkspolizei...In turn, the police officer was the Stasi's man. If a relative or friend came to stay overnight, it was reported. Schools, universities and hospitals were infiltrated from top to bottom. German academe was shocked to learn that Heinrich Fink, professor of theology and vice- chancellor of East Berlin's Humboldt University, had been a Stasi informer since 1968. After Fink's Stasi connections came to light, he was summarily fired. Doctors, lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, and sports figures were co-opted by Stasi officers, as were waiters and hotel personnel. Tapping about 100,000 telephone lines in East Germany and West Berlin around the clock was the job of 2,000 officers... Churchmen, including high officials of both Protestant and Catholic denominations, were recruited en masse as secret informants. Their offices and confessionals were infested with eavesdropping devices. Even the director of Leipzig's famous Thomas Church choir, Hans- Joachim Rotzsch, was forced to resign when he was unmasked as a Spitzel, the people's pejorative for a Stasi informant.\\"Koehler (1999), page 9. In an interview with journalist Anna Funder, an ex-Stasi officer recalled, \\"Most often, people we approached would inform for us. It was very rare that they would not. However, sometimes we felt that we might need to know where their weak points were, just in case. For example, if we wanted a pastor, we'd find out if he'd had an affair, or had a drinking problem‚Äîthings that we could use as leverage. Mostly though, people said yes.\\"Anna Funder, Stasiland: True Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall, Granta Books, 2004. Page 198. On Mielke's orders, and with his full knowledge, Stasi officers also engaged in arbitrary arrest, kidnapping, brutal harassment of political dissidents, torture, and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of citizens. In a 1991 interview, Jewish Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said, \\"The Stasi was much, much worse than the Gestapo, if you consider only the oppression of its own people. The Gestapo had 40,000 officials watching a country of 80 million, while the Stasi employed 102,000 to control only 17 million.\\" =Activities abroad= Markus Wolf. During Mielke's tenure, the Stasi's operations beyond East Germany were overseen by Markus Wolf and the Hauptverwaltung Aufkl√§rung (MfS-HVA). Mielke and Wolf provided money, training, and surveillance equipment to help build pro-Soviet secret police forces in Fidel Castro's Cuba,Seduced by Secrets: Inside the Stasi's Spy-Tech World.

In what John Koehler has dubbed, \\"The Invisible Invasion\\", some West German citizens collaborated out of Marxist beliefs, but others were recruited through blackmail, greed, career frustrations, or sexual favors from Stasi operatives.Koehler (1999), pages 149‚Äì201. Another tactic was for Stasi military advisers assigned to African and Middle Eastern countries to request the arrest of West German tourists. Local police would then turn the prisoner over to the Stasi agent, who would offer the West German a choice between espionage or incarceration.Koehler (1999), page 362. Senior politicians from the Social Democratic Party of Germany,Koehler (1999), pages 151‚Äì163, 187‚Äì189. the Free Democratic Party of Germany,Koehler (1999), pages 189‚Äì190. and the Christian Democratic UnionKoehler (1999), page 190. were exposed and, when still alive, prosecuted. Mielke and Wolf also seriously compromised West Germany's police departments,Koehler (1999), pages 192‚Äì195 foreign and domestic intelligence services,Koehler (1999), pages 163‚Äì187, 192‚Äì193. diplomatic corps,Koehler (1999), pages 193‚Äì195, 243‚Äì248. military-industrial complex,Koehler (1999), pages 195‚Äì198. and journalistic profession.Koehler (1999), pages 198‚Äì200. The Stasi compromised the United States militaryKoehler (1999), pages 203‚Äì243. and diplomaticKoehler (1999), pages 248‚Äì249. presence in West Germany. The most damaging American to spy for the Stasi was United States Army Sergeant James Hall III,Koehler (1999), pages 225‚Äì236. who volunteered his services to Soviet and East German intelligence in November 1981. Sergeant Hall sold the Stasi 13,088 pages of classified documents,Spurenvernichtung im Amt, Der Spiegel, 26 June 1999 including detailed information about Project Trojan, a worldwide electronic network with the ability to pinpoint armored vehicles, missiles and aircraft by recording their signal emissions during wartimeKoehler (1999), page 227. and the complete National SIGINT Requirements List (NSRL), a 4258-page document about NSA operations at home and abroad. In 1988, Sergeant Hall was tricked into confessing his espionage career to an undercover FBI Special Agent named Dmitri Droujinsky, a Russian-American who was posing as an agent of the KGB. When news of Sergeant Hall's arrest became public, one Washington intelligence official called the breach, \\"the Army's Walker Case.\\"Koehler (1999), pages 235‚Äì236. =Collusion with Nazism= Former SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann during his trial in Jerusalem, 1961. Beginning in 1960, Mielke and Wolf used false flag recruitment to secretly organize and finance Neo-Nazi organizations, which they then instructed to vandalize Jewish religious and cultural sites throughout West Germany. During the Jerusalem trial of Adolf Eichmann, Stasi agents sent letters to West German Neo-Nazis and Waffen-SS veterans, urging them to speak out and to raise money for Eichmann's defense attorney. This was done in order to lend credibility to Communist propaganda about the allegedly Fascist and neo-Nazi orientation of the Federal Republic of Germany.Neo-Nazism: a threat to Europe? Jillian Becker, Institute for European Defence & Strategic Studies. P. 16. According to German historian Michael Wolffsohn, \\"There is no doubt that in the 1960s as now, there were Nazis who were unreconstructed, unchangeable and evil, but without the help of East Germany, these Nazis were incapable of a national, coordinated campaign. That was true of right-wing extremist criminals in the 1980s as well. The East German Communists used anything they could against West Germany, including the... fears by Western countries and Jews that a new Nazism could be growing in West Germany. There is... evidence that the East Germans continued to use Anti-Semitism as a tool against West Germany in the 1970s and perhaps right up until 1989.\\"\\"E. Germany Ran Antisemitic Campaign in West in '60s.\\". The Washington Post, 28 February 1993. In a 1991 interview with John Koehler, Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said of the Stasi, \\"They not only terrorized their own people worse than the Gestapo, but the government was the most Anti-Semitic and Anti-Israeli in the entire Eastern Bloc. They did nothing to help the West in tracking down Nazi criminals; they ignored all requests from West German judicial authorities for assistance. We have just discovered shelves of files on Nazis stretching over four miles. Now we also know how the Stasi used those files. They blackmailed Nazi criminals who fled abroad after the war into spying for them. What's more, the Stasi trained terrorists from all over the world.\\"John Koehler, The Stasi: The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police, page 27, 414. Footnote 35. =Support for paramilitary and terrorist groups= During a 1979 visit to the GDR by senior PLO member Salah Khalaf, Mielke said, \\"We are paying great attention to the Palestine resistance and the other revolutionary forces fighting against the policies of the United States and against the provocations of the Israeli aggressor. Together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, we will do everything to support this just battle.\\"Koehler (1999), pages 367‚Äì368. With this in mind, Mielke ordered the Stasi to finance, arm, and train, \\"urban guerrillas,\\" from numerous countries. According to former Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand, Mielke's ties to violent paramilitary groups were overseen by Markus Wolf and Department Three of the MfS-HVA.Koehler (1999), pages 362‚Äì363. Members of the West German Baader- Meinhoff Group,Koehler (1999), pages 387‚Äì401. the Chilean Manuel Rodr√≠guez Patriotic Front,Koehler (1999), pages 311‚Äì315. and Umkhonto we Sizwe, the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress,Koehler (1999), pages 316‚Äì318. were brought to East Germany for training in the use of military hardware, insurgent tactics, and, \\"the leadership role of the Party.\\"Koehler (1999), page 313. Similar treatment was meted out to Palestinians from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Abu Nidal, and Black September.Koehler (1999), pages 359‚Äì386. Other Stasi agents worked as military advisers to Soviet-backed African guerrilla organizations and the governments they later formed. They included the Namibian SWAPO and the Angolan MPLA during the South African Border War, the FRELIMO during the Mozambican War of Independence and civil war, and Robert Mugabe's ZANLA during the Rhodesian Bush War.Koehler (1999), page 317. Colonel Wiegand revealed that Mielke and Wolf provided bodyguards from the Stasi's counter-terrorism division for Venezuelan-born PLO terrorist Carlos the JackalKoehler (1999), pages 368‚Äì371. and Black September leader Abu DaoudKoehler (1999), pages 363‚Äì367. during their visits to the GDR. Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 Munich massacre and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, \\"a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary,\\" and that there was no proof that he was a terrorist.Koehler (1999), pages 365‚Äì366. During the 1980s, Wiegand secretly blackmailed a Libyan diplomat into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand's informant told him that the La Belle bombing and other terrorist attacks against American and West German citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED's Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.Koehler (1999), pages 325‚Äì357. According to John Koehler, \\"Murder, kidnapping, extortion, bank robbery, and arson were felonies under the East German criminal code. However, if these offenses were committed under the banner of the 'anti-imperialist struggle,' the communist system would look the other way. Moreover, it had assigned the Stasi to make sure that terrorists were properly trained for murder and mayhem. There was no limits to the East German regime's involvement with terrorism, so long as it could be ideologically justified.\\"Koehler (1999), page 387. The Peaceful Revolution The SED dispatched plainclothes officers to arrest demonstrators (depicted in October 1989, prior to die Wende). According to John Koehler, \\"Increasingly concerned over the growing popular opposition, Stasi Minister Mielke early in 1989 ordered the creation of a special elite unit for crushing disturbances. Its personnel were carefully selected members of the counterespionage and counterterrorism directorate. They were equipped with special batons similar to electric cattle prods but much more powerful. In a secret speech to top- ranking Stasi officers on 29 June, Mielke warned that, 'hostile opposing forces and groups have already achieved a measure of power and are using all methods to achieve a change in the balance of power. Former Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand told me he was horrified when Mielke compared the situation with that of China two months earlier. Chinese students in Beijing had begun massive protests in April and in May, during a student demonstration in Tiananmen Square, security troops had opened fire on them killing hundreds. 'Mielke said our situation was comparable and we had to be ready to counter it with all means and methods,' Wiegand recalled. 'Mielke said that the Chinese leadership had succeeded in smothering the protests before the situation got out of hand.'\\"John Koehler, The Stasi, pages 403‚Äì404. Despite Mielke's attempts to suppress them, East Germany's protesters grew more emboldened with every arrest. =40th anniversary of the GDR= The 40th Anniversary of the GDR, 7 October 1989. As the fortieth anniversary of the GDR approached, Mielke ordered, \\"We must stop the internal enemy. At the least hint of a disturbance of the celebration, isolate and arrest them.\\"Peterson (2002), page 202. One former Stasi Major recalled, \\"We mixed inconspicuously with the demonstrators, accompanied by our IMs. Hundreds of us stood at the sides of the street in order to stop any activity before it got started. We barely got any sleep toward the end. Never did I sense that the people were afraid of the MfS. The Stasi was more afraid of the people than the people were of them.\\"Peterson (2002), pages 202‚Äì203. According to Koehler, \\"Despite the unrest, the regime celebrated its fortieth with a huge, pompous ceremony in Berlin on 7 October, while tens of thousands of outside the ornate building of the State Council. The People's Police cordons were utterly ineffectual. As Stasi Minister Erich Mielke drove up and was greeted by General G√ºnter Kratsch, the counterintelligence chief, Mielke screamed at police: \\"Club those pigs into submission!\\"Koehler (1999), page 405. ()Peterson (2002), page 203. The police ignored Mielke's ranting.Koehler, The Stasi, page 405. As more and more East Germans were arrested for protesting the 40th anniversary celebrations, many of them sang The Internationale in Vopo and Stasi custody to imply that they, rather than their captors, were the real working class and the real revolutionaries. According to Anna Funder, \\"There was a sea of red flags, a torchlight procession, and tanks. The old men on the podium wore light-grey suits studded with medals. Mikhail Gorbachev stood next to Honecker, but he looked uncomfortable among the much older Germans. He had come to tell them that it was over, to convince the leadership to adopt his reformist policies. He had spoken openly about the danger of not 'responding to reality.' He pointedly told the Politburo that, 'life punishes those who come too late.' Honecker and Mielke ignored him, just as they ignored the crowds when they chanted, \\"Gorby, help us! Gorby, help us!\\"Funder (2003), page 64. =Plan X= Ranis Castle in Thuringia was among the locations selected for an internment camp under Plan X. In Stasi documents, it was referred to as \\"Rosebush\\" ().Koehler (1999), page 142. On 8 October 1989, Mielke and Honecker ordered the Stasi to implement \\"Plan X\\"‚Äîthe SED's plan to arrest and indefinitely detain 85,939 East Germans during a state of emergency. According to John Koehler, Plan X had been in preparation since 1979 and was, \\"a carbon copy of how the Nazi concentration camps got their start after Hitler came to power in 1933.\\"Koehler (1999), page 143. By 1984, 23 sites had been selected for \\"isolation and internment camps.\\" Those who were to be imprisoned in them ran into six categories; including anyone who had ever been under surveillance for anti-state activities, including all members of peace movements which were not under Stasi control.Koehler (1999), pages 142‚Äì143. According to Anna Funder, \\"The plans contained exact provisions for the use of all available prisons and camps, and when those were full for the conversion of other buildings: Nazi detention centers, schools, hospitals, and factory holiday hostels. Every detail was foreseen, from where the doorbell was located on the house of each person to be arrested to the adequate supply of barbed wire and the rules of dress and etiquette in the camps...\\"Funder (2003), page 62. However, when Mielke sent the orders, codenamed \\"Shield\\" (), to each local Stasi precinct to begin the planned arrests, he was not obeyed. Terrified of an East German version of the mass lynchings of Hungarian secret police agents during the 1956 Revolution, Stasi agents throughout the GDR fortified their office- buildings and barricaded themselves inside.Funder (2003), pages 63‚Äì64. =Toppling Honecker= Mielke receives an award from Erich Honecker 8 February 1980. Even as orders were going out to implement Plan X, Mielke had already thrown his support behind the anti-Honecker faction in the SED's Politburo. Although he was of the same generation as Honecker and had matured in an environment where following orders was the rule, he was sober enough and politically savvy enough to realize this approach no longer worked. During a session on 10 October 1989, Mielke delivered a report attacking Honecker's desire to violently suppress the demonstrations rather than offer concessions. In what Edward N. Peterson has called \\"a remarkable disclaimer of responsibility for the violence,\\" Mielke declared that Honecker's orders to him \\"were built on false situation judgments.\\" He added that Honecker's commands on 7 and 8 October \\"were false and undifferentiated condemnations of those who think differently. Despite this evaluation, there was never any instructions to use violence against persons. There is nothing in our basic principles to consider a demonstration as part of a possible counterrevolutionary coup.\\"Peterson (2002), pages 204‚Äì205. Mielke also claimed that \\"the Party judged the situation falsely. We tried to tell them the true situation, but enough was not done.\\" Mielke argued in favor of solving the demonstrations politically and giving \\"every DDR citizen the right to travel.\\"Peterson (2002), page 205. On 17 October 1989, Mielke and the rest of the GDR's Politburo met to follow Gorbachev's demand, voiced in August, for Honecker be removed as General Secretary of the SED and State Council chairman.Peterson (2002), pages 208‚Äì209. Suspecting that Honecker's personal bodyguards might try to arrest the members of the Central Committee when they met to vote Honecker out in favour of Egon Krenz, Mielke saw to it that Stasi agents who were loyal to him were stationed near the meeting room. While deliberations were underway, Mielke told Honecker that \\"we simply cannot start shooting with tanks,\\" and tried to impress upon Honecker that it was \\"the end\\".Sarotte, p. 88 After the vote to oust Honecker passed, Mielke \\"got nasty,\\" and accused Honecker of corruption. Honecker responded that Mielke should not open his mouth so much.Peterson (2002), page 209. Mielke responded by putting the last nail into Honecker's coffin. He announced that the MfS had a file on the now-ousted leader. It contained proof of Honecker's corrupt business practices, sexual activities, and how, as a member of the underground Communist Party of Germany during the Nazi years, he had been arrested by the Gestapo and had named names. To the shock of both the Politburo and the Stasi, Krenz's first televised addresses failed to win popular support. Despite his assurances that the SED was at last ready to embrace Gorbachev's policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, Krenz's approval ratings remained extremely low.Buckley (2004), page 175. Former Politburo member G√ºnter Schabowski later recalled, \\"We made a palace revolution without offering a real alternative... We had not quickly and thoroughly enough whittled away from Stalin's methods.\\" =Defeat= On 7 November 1989, Mielke resigned, along with eleven out of eighteen members of the SED's Council of Ministers, in response to the increasing disintegration of the GDR. Two days later, Schabowski announced on television that the East-West border was open without restriction.Buckley (2004), page 163. According to Anna Funder, there was panic at Stasi Headquarters in Berlin-Lichtenberg, \\"Stasi officers were instructed to destroy files, starting with the most incriminating‚Äìthose naming westerners who spied for them, and those that concerned deaths. They shredded the files until the shredders collapsed. Among other shortages in the East, there was a shredder shortage, so they had to send agents out under cover to West Berlin to buy more. In Building 8 alone, the citizens' movement found over a hundred burnt out shredders.Funder (2003), page 67. According to William F. Buckley, Jr., \\"In the weeks after 9 November, Stasi offices were stormed in various cities around East Germany. Stasi commissars in three of those cities committed suicide. But not one was lynched or executed.\\"Buckley (2004), page 186. =Televised humiliation= Mielke addressing the SV Dynamo, 25 March 1983. On 13 November 1989, Mielke was summoned to deliver a briefing about the protests to the GDR parliament, or Volkskammer. Formerly a \\"rubber stamp parliament,\\" the disintegration of the SED's power had allowed the Volkskammer to begin exercising real authority over the GDR. Therefore, Mielke, as the head of the Stasi (known as the \\"shield and sword of the [SED] party\\"), was summoned before the newly empowered parliament to justify his position in government. As his speech was broadcast live, Mielke began by using overly bombastic, flag-waving language, saying \\"We have, comrades, dear assembly members, an extraordinarily high amount of contact with all working people\\" ().. To his shock, the Volkskammer responded with boos, whistles, and catcalls. His face grief-stricken and pale, Mielke then tried to defuse the situation, \\"Yes, we have such contact, let me tell you-let me tell you why. I am not afraid to stand here and to give you an honest answer\\" (). Mielke continued, speaking of the \\"triumph\\" of the socialist economy, continuing all the while to address the members of the Volkskammer as \\"Comrades\\" (). In response, Volkskammer member Dietmar Czok of the Christian Democratic Union, rose from his seat and raised his hand. The Volkskammer's President, G√ºnther Maleuda, interrupted Mielke and urged Czok to speak. With his voice dripping with contempt, Czok told Mielke, \\"As a point of order, let me remind you that there are more people sitting in this Chamber than just your Comrades!\\" (). In response, many in the Volkskammer burst into applause, cheers, and shouts of \\"We are not your Comrades!\\" () Trying to appear magnanimous, Mielke responded, \\"This is a natural, Humanistic question! This is just a question of formality.\\" (), leading to further shouts of displeasure from the members of the Volkskammer. In a last ditch effort, Mielke \\"raised his arms like an evangelist,\\"Koehler (1999), page 407. and cried, \\"I love all ‚Äì all Humanity! I really do! I set myself before you!\\" ()Video Footage: Erich Mielke before the \\"Volkskammer,\\" 13 November 1989. (in German). Everyone in the room, including staunch SED members, burst out laughing. John Koehler later wrote, \\"Mielke was finished.\\" Mielke's address to the Volkskammer remains the most famous broadcast in the history of German television. Anna Funder has written, \\"When they think of Mielke, East Germans like to think of this.\\"Funder (2003), page 68. =The Fall= On 17 November 1989, the Volkskammer renamed the MfS the Amt f√ºr Nationale Sicherheit (AfNS ‚Äì Office for National Security). The following day, Mielke's tenure in office ended when the Volkskammer appointed Generalleutnant Wolfgang Schwanitz as the new director of the AfNS. On 1 December 1989, the Volkskammer nullified the clause of the GDR constitution that enshrined the SED's \\"leading role\\" in the government and formally ending Communist rule in East Germany. Two days later, the SED announced that Mielke's party membership had been permanently revoked. Years later, he lamented, \\"Millions have died for nothing. Everything we fought for ‚Äì it has all amounted to nothing.\\" He also said, \\"If the party had given me the task, then there would perhaps still be a GDR today. On that you can rely.\\"\\"Erich Mielke, Powerful Head of Stasi, East Germany's Vast Spy Network, Dies at 92,\\" The New York Times, 26 May 2000. Prosecution =Indictments= Baader-Meinhoff Group's bombing attack on Ramstein Air Base, 31 August 1981. On 7 December 1989, Erich Mielke was arrested and placed in solitary confinement for embezzlement of public funds in order to improve his hunting estate.Funder (2003), page 69. He was charged with \\"Damaging the People's Economy\\" (Sch√§digung der Volkswirtschaft).Koehler (1999), page s 407‚Äì408. On 7 January 1990, he was further charged with high treason and conspiring with Erich Honecker to bug the telephones and open the mail of every one of East Germany's citizens.Koehler (1999), page 408.Ex-E. German Official Charged With Fraud and Embezzlement, Los Angeles Times, 28 April 1991. Meanwhile, the Federal Constitutional Court announced that Mielke had also been indicted for having ordered two terrorist attacks by the Baader- Meinhoff Group against United States military personnel who were stationed on West German soil. The first was the car bomb attack against the United States Air Force at Ramstein Air Base on 31 August 1981. The second was the attempted murder with an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket of United States Army General Frederick Kroesen, his wife, and the West German police officer who was driving their armored Mercedes at Heidelberg on 15 September 1981.\\"World IN BRIEF : GERMANY : Ex-Security Chief Accused in Attack\\", Los Angeles Times, 27 March 1991. After German reunification in October 1990, Mielke was also indicted for ordering the shootings of defectors at the Berlin Wall. He was also charged with misuse of office, breach of trust, and incitement to pervert the course of justice. =B√ºlowplatz trial= Pl√∂tzensee Prison, where Erich Mielke served his pre-trial detention, 1989‚Äì1993. In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the first degree murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig.\\"E. German Stasi Chief on Trial; Political Error Seen : Justice: The spectacle seems an embarrassment. The murder charges predate communism's rise,\\" Los Angeles Times, 11 February 1992. The evidence for Mielke's guilt was drawn from the original police files, the 1934 trial transcripts, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke had admitted that, \\"the B√ºlowplatz Affair,\\" had been his reason for fleeing Germany. All had been found in Mielke's house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the files for purposes of \\"blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.\\"Berlin Journal; Silent Still, the Old Man Who Trafficked in Secrets The New York Times, 11 March 1993. Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified about how Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the B√ºlowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965.Koehler (1999), pages 1‚Äì3. During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber.\\"Ex-Chief of E. German Secret Police Freed : Europe: Court releases Erich Mielke. He served time for 1931 killings‚Äîbut not for any crime from Communist era.\\" Los Angeles Times, 2 August 1995. When a journalist for Der Spiegel attempted to interview him in Pl√∂tzensee Prison, Mielke responded, \\"I want to go back to my bed\\"\\"Besuch im Gef√§ngnis, Der Spiegel, 31 August 1992. (). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution. After twenty months of one-and-a-half-hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years' imprisonment. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he \\"will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.\\"\\"Erich Mielke, Powerful Head of Stasi, East Germany's Vast Spy Network, Dies at 92.\\" The New York Times, 26 May 2000. =Imprisonment= Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge adjourned the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally competent to stand trial. During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television. In 1995, parole officers and Mielke's attorneys argued that he was \\"totally confused\\" and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany's oldest prison inmateTam Eastley, On the Stasi Trail in Berlin, The Guardian, 2 March 2012. and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days.Koehler (1999), page 410. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was \\"not interested in chasing an 87-year-old man anymore\\" and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended. According to Koehler, \\"[Mielke's] bank account, which held more than 300,000 Marks (about US$187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a 15,000 acre hunting preserve. After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two-room, 600-square- foot flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US$512) a month.\\" Death Mielke' grave. Erich Mielke died on 21 May 2000, aged 92, in a Berlin nursing home. After being cremated at the Billig-Crematorium in Meissen,Billig-Crematorium von Meissen (In German). an urn containing Mielke's ashes was buried in an unmarked grave at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. An estimated 100 people reportedly attended the funeral. Erich Mielke's grave is outside the memorial section established at the entrance in 1951 by East German leaders for communist heroes.Obituary: \\"Erich Mielke, Powerful Head of Stasi, East Germany's Vast Spy Network, Dies at 92\\" Binder, David, The New York Times, 26 May 2000 Within hours of his funeral, the flowers and wreaths left at Mielke's grave were ripped to shreds by persons unknown. Legacy Writing in 2003, Australian journalist Anna Funder declared, \\"The name Mielke has now come to mean 'Stasi.' Victims are dubiously honored to find his signature in their files: on plans for someone to be observed 'with all possible methods', on commands for arrest, for kidnapping, instructions to judges for sentencing, orders for 'liquidation'. The honor is dubious because... he signed so many.\\"Funder (2003), page 56. In 2012, the museum at the former Stasi headquarters opened Mielke's office as a permanent exhibit. Soon after, The Guardian correspondent Tam Eastley visited the exhibit and numerous sites in Berlin connected to Mielke's life, times, and legacy. When she visited Mielke's grave, Eastley found that it had become a shrine for adherents of Ostalgie. Personal life Erich Mielke was a fitness enthusiast, a non-smoker, and drank very little. He was a keen hunter and owned a large area of ground where he would hunt animals with other East German and visiting Soviet officials. During the late 1940s, when Mielke was working as security chief of the DWK, he began a relationship with Gertrud Mueller, a seamstress. On 18 December 1948, shortly after the birth of their son Frank Mielke, Erich and Gertrud married in a civil ceremony.Koehler (1999), pages 54‚Äì55. According to the newspaper Bild, the Mielkes adopted an orphaned girl named Ingrid, who was born in 1950. Like her adopted brother Frank, Ingrid Mielke attended the Wilhelm Pieck School. She ultimately became a Captain in the Stasi and married a Stasi Lieutenant named Norbert Knappe. As of 1999, the Knappes had both refused to grant an interview to Bild reporters. In popular culture Erich Mielke has appeared as a character in both films and novels set in the GDR. * Volker Schl√∂ndorff's The Legend of Rita (2000), which focuses on Stasi collusion with the West German far-left terrorist organization Rote Armee Fraktion. In conversation with fictional Stasi officer Erwin Hull (Martin Wuttke), Mielke (Dietrich K√∂rner) expresses admiration for the RAF's campaign against the United States, West Germany, and the State of Israel, which he compares with his own activities against the Weimar Republic and the Nazis. The RAF members are then brought to a training camp, where Stasi agents instruct them in the use of grenade launchers and other kinds of military hardware. Mielke's name is never disclosed and Agent Hull addresses him only as, \\"Comrade General.\\" () * Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's The Lives of Others (2006), which focuses on the Stasi's surveillance and repression of the East German population. In the film, a previously loyal GDR playwright named Georg Dreymann (Sebastian Koch) publishes an anonymous article in the West German magazine Der Spiegel which accuses East Germany's Minister of Culture of having persecuted a blacklisted stage director until he hanged himself. Soon after the article goes to press, Mielke's voice is heard over the telephone giving a dressing down to fictional Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur). Addressed only as \\"Genosse Armeegeneral\\" (Mielke was the only person to ever hold that rank in the Stasi), Mielke threatens to throw Grubitz in front of a firing squad if he fails to identify and arrest the article's author. * In Philip Kerr's novel Field Grey (2010), Mielke first appears in 1931 Berlin, when protagonist Bernie Gunther saves him from being murdered by Nazi Brownshirts. The novel then flashes forward to 1954, when Gunther is recruited into a CIA plot to abduct Mielke from East Berlin.Book Review: Philip Kerr's 'Field Gray', The Washington Post, 24 April 2011. Honours and awards Mielke received a large number of awards and commemorative medals from organisations within the German Democratic Republic and from allied states.

According to W.H. Thorpe, the term was devised by C. Lloyd Morgan (1852‚Äì1936) after trying out similar phrases \\"trial and failure\\" and \\"trial and practice\\".Thorpe W.H. The origins and rise of ethology. Hutchinson, London & Praeger, New York. p26. Under Morgan's Canon, animal behaviour should be explained in the simplest possible way. Where behavior seems to imply higher mental processes, it might be explained by trial-and-error learning. An example is a skillful way in which his terrier Tony opened the garden gate, easily misunderstood as an insightful act by someone seeing the final behavior. Lloyd Morgan, however, had watched and recorded the series of approximations by which the dog had gradually learned the response, and could demonstrate that no insight was required to explain it. Edward Lee Thorndike was the initiator of the theory of trial and error learning based on the findings he showed how to manage a trial-and-error experiment in the laboratory. In his famous experiment, a cat was placed in a series of puzzle boxes in order to study the law of effect in learning.Thorndike E.L. 1898. Animal intelligence: an experimental study of the association processes in animals. Psychological Monographs #8. He plotted to learn curves which recorded the timing for each trial. Thorndike's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results, which was later refined and extended by B. F. Skinner's operant conditioning. Trial and error is also a method of problem solving, repair, tuning, or obtaining knowledge. In the field of computer science, the method is called generate and test (Brute force). In elementary algebra, when solving equations, it is guess and check. This approach can be seen as one of the two basic approaches to problem- solving, contrasted with an approach using insight and theory. However, there are intermediate methods which for example, use theory to guide the method, an approach known as guided empiricism. This way of thinking has become a mainstay of Karl Popper's falsificationist methodology in philosophy of science. Methodology The trial and error approach is used most successfully with simple problems and in games, and it is often the last resort when no apparent rule applies. This does not mean that the approach is inherently careless, for an individual can be methodical in manipulating the variables in an attempt to sort through possibilities that could result in success. Nevertheless, this method is often used by people who have little knowledge in the problem area. The trial-and-error approach has been studied from its natural computational point of view X. Bei, N. Chen, S. Zhang, On the Complexity of Trial and Error, STOC 2013 =Simplest applications= Ashby (1960, section 11/5) offers three simple strategies for dealing with the same basic exercise-problem, which have very different efficiencies. Suppose a collection of 1000 on/off switches have to be set to a particular combination by random-based testing, where each test is expected to take one second. [This is also discussed in Traill (1978/2006, section C1.2]. The strategies are: *the perfectionist all-or-nothing method, with no attempt at holding partial successes. This would be expected to take more than 10^301 seconds, [i.e., 2^1000 seconds, or 3¬∑5√ó(10^291) centuries] *a serial-test of switches, holding on to the partial successes (assuming that these are manifest), which would take 500 seconds on average * parallel-but-individual testing of all switches simultaneously, which would take only one second Note the tacit assumption here that no intelligence or insight is brought to bear on the problem. However, the existence of different available strategies allows us to consider a separate (\\"superior\\") domain of processing ‚Äî a \\"meta-level\\" above the mechanics of switch handling ‚Äî where the various available strategies can be randomly chosen. Once again this is \\"trial and error\\", but of a different type. =Hierarchies= Ashby's book develops this \\"meta-level\\" idea, and extends it into a whole recursive sequence of levels, successively above each other in a systematic hierarchy. On this basis, he argues that human intelligence emerges from such organization: relying heavily on trial-and- error (at least initially at each new stage), but emerging with what we would call \\"intelligence\\" at the end of it all. Thus presumably the topmost level of the hierarchy (at any stage) will still depend on simple trial-and-error. Traill (1978/2006) suggests that this Ashby-hierarchy probably coincides with Piaget's well-known theory of developmental stages. [This work also discusses Ashby's 1000-switch example; see ¬ßC1.2]. After all, it is part of Piagetian doctrine that children learn by first actively doing in a more-or-less random way, and then hopefully learn from the consequences ‚Äî which all has a certain to Ashby's random \\"trial-and-error\\". =Application= Traill (2008, espec. Table \\"S\\" on p.31) follows Jerne and Popper in seeing this strategy as probably underlying all knowledge-gathering systems ‚Äî at least in their initial phase. Four such systems are identified: *Natural selection which \\"educates\\" the DNA of the species, *The brain of the individual (just discussed); *The \\"brain\\" of society-as-such (including the publicly held body of science); and *The adaptive immune system. =Intention= In the Ashby- and-Cybernetics tradition, the word \\"trial\\" usually implies random-or- arbitrary, without any deliberate choice. Among non-cyberneticians, however, \\"trial\\" will often imply a deliberate subjective act by some adult human agent (e.g., in a court-room, or laboratory), which has sometimes led to confusion. Of course the situation becomes even more confusing if one accepts Ashby's hierarchical explanation of intelligence, and its implied ability to be deliberate and to creatively design ‚Äî all based ultimately on non-deliberate actions. The lesson here seems to be that one must simply be careful to clarify the meaning of one's own words, and indeed the words of others. [Incidentally it seems that consciousness is not an essential ingredient for intelligence as discussed. One of the greatest inventors with 1093 patents was Thomas Alva Edison (TAE). One of his most famous sayings is usually quoted as: \\"Genius is 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration.\\" Edison and his assistants would try, for example, 500 ways to invent something and when not successful, they would try another 500 ways. When an experiment was not successful, he was happy to admit that he now knew the things that did not work. Trial and error were Edison's most successful means of the invention. Most today believe Edison did not follow a scientific theory to invent but invented by Trial And Error (TAE). Today, the approach of voodoo programming is a usage where code is composed of trial and error until something which produces the desired output is found. Features Trial and error has a number of features: *solution-oriented: trial and error makes no attempt to discover why a solution works, merely that it is a solution. *problem-specific: trial and error makes no attempt to generalize a solution to other problems. *non- optimal: trial and error is generally an attempt to find a solution, not all solutions, and not the best solution. *needs little knowledge: trials and error can proceed where there is little or no knowledge of the subject. It is possible to use trial and error to find all solutions or the best solution, when a testably finite number of possible solutions exist. To find all solutions, one simply makes a note and continues, rather than ending the process, when a solution is found, until all solutions have been tried. To find the best solution, one finds all solutions by the method just described and then comparatively evaluates them based upon some predefined set of criteria, the existence of which is a condition for the possibility of finding a best solution. (Also, when only one solution can exist, as in assembling a jigsaw puzzle, then any solution found is the only solution and so is necessarily the best.) Examples Trial and error has traditionally been the main method of finding new drugs, such as antibiotics. Chemists simply try chemicals at random until they find one with the desired effect. In a more sophisticated version, chemists select a narrow range of chemicals it is thought may have some effect using a technique called structure-activity relationship. (The latter case can be alternatively considered as a changing of the problem rather than of the solution strategy: instead of \\"What chemical will work well as an antibiotic?\\" the problem in the sophisticated approach is \\"Which, if any, of the chemicals in this narrow range will work well as an antibiotic?\\") The method is used widely in many disciplines, such as polymer technology to find new polymer types or families. Trial and error is also commonly seen in player responses to video games - when faced with an obstacle or boss, players often form a number of strategies to surpass the obstacle or defeat the boss, with each strategy being carried out before the player either succeeds or quits the game. Sports teams also make use of trial and error to qualify for and/or progress through the playoffs and win the championship, attempting different strategies, plays, lineups and formations in hopes of defeating each and every opponent along the way to victory. This is especially crucial in playoff series in which multiple wins are required to advance, where a team that loses a game will have the opportunity to try new tactics to find a way to win, if they are not eliminated yet. The scientific method can be regarded as containing an element of trial and error in its formulation and testing of hypotheses. Also compare genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning ‚Äì all varieties for search which apply the basic idea of trial and error. Biological evolution can be considered as a form of trial and error. Random mutations and sexual genetic variations can be viewed as trials and poor reproductive fitness, or lack of improved fitness, as the error. Thus after a long time 'knowledge' of well-adapted genomes accumulates simply by virtue of them being able to reproduce. Bogosort, a conceptual sorting algorithm (that is extremely inefficient and impractical), can be viewed as a trial and error approach to sorting a list. However, typical simple examples of bogosort do not track which orders of the list have been tried and may try the same order any number of times, which violates one of the basic principles of trial and error. Trial and error is actually more efficient and practical than bogosort; unlike bogosort, it is guaranteed to halt in finite time on a finite list, and might even be a reasonable way to sort extremely short lists under some conditions. Jumping spiders of the genus Portia use trial and error to find new tactics against unfamiliar prey or in unusual situations, and remember the new tactics. Tests show that Portia fimbriata and Portia labiata can use trial and error in an artificial environment, where the spider's objective is to cross a miniature lagoon that is too wide for a simple jump, and must either jump then swim or only swim.

Led by vocalists, guitarists and songwriters Gary Louris and Mark Olson, its country rock sound was influential on many bands who played the Twin Cities circuit during the 1980s and 1990s like Uncle Tupelo, the Gear Daddies and the Honeydogs. They have released eleven studio albums with and without Olson who left the band in 1995, including five on the American Recordings label. On hiatus from 2005 to 2009, the 1995 lineup of the band reunited, releasing the album, Mockingbird Time, in September 2011. After the tour, Olson again left the band. After another hiatus in 2013, the 1997 lineup led by Louris reunited to play shows in 2014 to support the reissue of three albums released between 1997 and 2003. The band has remained active touring and recording since, including the release of the albums Live at The Belly Up in 2015, Paging Mr. Proust, produced by Peter Buck in 2016, Back Roads and Abandoned Motels in 2018 and XOXO in 2020. History =Founding years and early success (1985‚Äì1995)= The Jayhawks was formed in 1985 by Mark Olson (acoustic guitar and vocals), Gary Louris (electric guitar and vocals), Marc Perlman (bass) and Norm Rogers (drums). Their first album, The Jayhawks, was released by Bunkhouse Records, a small independent label, in 1986. Their music at the time, mostly written by Olson, showed a strong roots/country rock influence. Rogers left and was replaced by Thad Spencer, and the band worked for the next years on demo tapes in search of a major label recording contract. During this period, Louris left the band briefly (following a car accident) and Dan Gaarder replaced him. Louris returned, and the collected demos from 1986 to 1989 were brought together to create Blue Earth, released on the Minneapolis label Twin Tone in 1989. On this album Louris shared more of the songwriting with Olson. After touring the U.S. in support of Blue Earth, Spencer left the band and was replaced in 1988 by Ken Callahan, who stayed with the band until 1993. In 1991, Dave Ayers, the head of A&R; for Twin Tone, was on a phone call with A&R; representative George Drakoulias of Def American while Blue Earth played in the background. Drakoulias asked about the music and eventually met with and signed the band to the label later that year. In 1992 the Jayhawks had their major label release, Hollywood Town Hall, on Def American. The album was produced by Drakoulias and recorded primarily in Los Angeles and at Pachyderm Recording Studio in Minnesota. Though Louris's fuzzy guitar was at the forefront, a clear folksy influence was also emerging in Olson and Louris's songwriting. The album was successful, powered by the single \\"Waiting for the Sun\\", and it brought the Jayhawks a wider fan base. Adding Karen Grotberg on keyboards and vocals, the band toured extensively. That year Olson, Louris and Perlman, along with Olson's longtime friend and future collaborator in the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers, Mike Russell, were recruited by Joe Henry as the backing band for his album \\"\\"Short Man's Room\\" and its 1993 followup, \\"Kindness of the World.\\" In 1995 they went into the studio to produce Tomorrow the Green Grass on the renamed American Recordings label. The lead track, \\"Blue\\", was a Top 40 hit in Canada (peaking at No. 33), but the record's production had been very expensive and the album failed to sell as expected in the U.S. Among the album's songs is \\"Miss Williams' Guitar,\\" a love song for Olson's then-girlfriend, singer-songwriter Victoria Williams (the pair later married, but divorced in February 2006). Drummer, singer and songwriter Tim O'Reagan joined the band for the 1995 tour; session drummer Don Heffington had played on the album. =Middle years (1995‚Äì2004)= By the end of 1995, Olson unexpectedly left the band to spend more time with Williams (with whom he would later form the Original Harmony Ridge Creekdippers). The band continued to record as the Jayhawks, adding Kraig Johnson on guitar. Johnson, another Minneapolis musical fixture, had played in the seminal SST band Run Westy Run, Iffy and Golden Smog. The Jayhawks released Sound of Lies in 1997, with Louris composing most of the songs and allowing all of his influences a share in the proceedings. The result mixed straight rock (the ironic \\"Big Star\\"), psychedelic, acoustic (the title track) and even some dub elements, taking the band far from its country- influenced origins. Smile (2000), produced by Bob Ezrin, had more of a pop music feel (which utilized new sounds for the band, like drum loops and synthesizers), jarring some of the band's long-time fans. The New York Times positively reviewed the album, but in a nod to the band's lack of widespread recognition, titled the review \\"What If You Made a Classic and No One Cared?\\" Though still a member through the recording of the album, Grotberg left the band before the Smile tour and was replaced by Jen Gunderman. The song \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\\" appeared in a Ralph Lauren commercial, the second soundtrack released from Dawson's Creek Songs from Dawson's Creek Volume 2, and the 2001 film All Over the Guy. Rainy Day Music (2003), was stripped down, more acoustic, and generally seen as a return to their alt-country roots (\\"Tailspin,\\" \\"Stumbling Through the Dark,\\" \\"You Look So Young\\"). The band now consisted of founding members Louris and Perlman, along with drummer O'Reagan and touring band member ex-Long Ryder Stephen McCarthy, from Richmond, Virginia, who also played with Johnny Hott and the Piedmont Surprise. McCarthy added pedal steel, lap steel, banjo, guitar and backing vocals to the album and subsequent live shows. This lineup toured in 2003 and early 2004, including their first appearance on PBS's long-running series Austin City Limits. The band's final show was in Valencia, Spain. In addition to their studio albums, the Jayhawks released Live from the Women's Club, an all- acoustic live recording of Louris, Perlman and O'Reagan from 2002. It was sold only at concerts as an \\"Official Jayhawks Bootleg.\\" It includes the demo of the original version of \\"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\\", called \\"Someone Will\\", and a cover of David Wiffen's \\"(Lost My) Driving Wheel\\", originally popularized by Tom Rush.On Tom Rush (Columbia, 1970). A follow-up, Live from the Women's Club 2, contains the rest of the concert, including a cover of Tim Hardin's \\"Reason to Believe\\" and a rendition of \\"Jennifer Save Me\\" from Golden Smog, the alt/country supergroup of which Louris was a founding member (and which Perlman later joined). =Hiatus (2004‚Äì2009)= Both old and new Jayhawks members progressed to solo efforts and side projects, and the band as a whole was generally considered to be broken up and not expected to produce new material soon. However, the band members appeared to have kept in touch, tour together in their other projects, and reunited on occasion. Olson and Louris toured together in the winter of 2005 and spring of 2006, billed as \\"From the Jayhawks: An Evening with Mark Olson & Gary Louris, Together Again.\\" In September 2008, the 1995 lineup of Louris, Olson, O'Reagan, Grotberg and Perlman reunited briefly for the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. In January 2009, Olson and Louris released an acoustic album, Ready for the Flood. = Aftermath (2009‚Äìpresent) = The Jayhawks in 2012 In April 2009, Billboard reported that the Jayhawks had reunited. The band's mid-1990s lineup played two shows that summer, one at Barcelona's Primavera Sound Festival on May 30 and one at Minneapolis's Basilica Block Party on July 10. Band co-leader Louris told Billboard that the reunion would be a part-time thing: \\"I think the plan is that we're going to play festivals. Next year, we're hoping to play Bonnaroo and things like that. We'll see if it grows from there.\\" In July 2009, Sony Legacy and American Recordings released Music from the North Country, The Jayhawks Anthology, a project supervised by Louris. The standard CD features highlights from the band's studio albums, while a deluxe version adds rarities, B-sides, and unreleased material, as well as a DVD of the band's music videos. On May 18, 2010, the initial release The Jayhawks was digitally remastered from reel-to-reel and reissued on Lost Highway Records. The re-release features an eleven-page booklet designed by Olson. In fall 2010, the Jayhawks returned to the recording studio, planning to have a new album out by spring or early summer 2011. In January 2011, Legacy Recordings reissued collector's editions of both Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass, each featuring outtakes and B-sides. Tomorrow the Green Grass features a second disc, entitled The Mystery Demos, featuring tracks from two recording sessions with Olson and Louris in 1992. Prior to the release of The Mystery Demos, several of the featured tracks had been re-recorded and released on various Jayhawks related albums, such as Olson's solo release, The Salvation Blues and the Olson‚ÄìLouris collaboration Ready for the Flood. To celebrate the release of the reissues, the Jayhawks‚ÄîLouris, Olson, Perlman, Grotberg, and O'Reagan‚Äîlaunched a concert mini-tour in January 2011, with shows in Toronto (January 18), New York City (January 20 and 21), Philadelphia (January 22), Chicago (January 27 and 28), and Minneapolis (January 29). For the January 20 show at New York's Webster Hall, the band performed Hollywood Town Hall in its entirety, followed by the complete Tomorrow the Green Grass the following evening.The Hawks Are Out, by Daniel Alleva, The Aquarian Weekly, January 19, 2011. In 2011 the band reunited again and recorded a new studio album. The lineup consisted of Olson, Louris, Perlman, Grotberg, and O'Reagan, and, as Louris said, \\"Our goal is to make the best Jayhawks album that's ever been done\\". Eighteen songs were recorded, 16 of them new, but only 12 made it to the final release. The album, Mockingbird Time, was released September 20. From 2009 to 2012 this lineup performed over 100 shows in North America and Europe before once again going on hiatus in the fall of 2012. 2014 saw new activity from the band once again. The final phase of the career- spanning reissue project started in 2009 commenced in the summer of 2014 with the reissue (on CD and LP) of the three albums the band made after Olson left in 1995: Sound of Lies (1997), Smile (2000) and Rainy Day Music (2003). The reissues, on American Recordings/UME, feature bonus tracks, new liner notes and fresh remastering from original analog sources by Vic Anesini. Deluxe two- LP vinyl editions were also released; this was the first vinyl release in the U.S. of Smile and the first time vinyl copies of Sound of Lies and Rainy Day Music had been available after having been long out of print. Most of the 1997 touring lineup (Louris, Perlman, O'Reagan, Grotberg and Johnson) toured in 2014 and 2015 to support the reissues, concentrating on material from the 1997‚Äì2004 era of the band that had largely gone unplayed in concert for over a decade. The band released Live at the Belly-Up, a digital-only album on April 7, 2015. First Avenue The band announced in September 2015 that they were recording a new studio album with the 2014‚Äì2015 lineup. The album was recorded in Portland, Oregon, with Peter Buck from R.E.M and Tucker Martine producing. In January 2016 The Jayhawks announced on their Tumblr account that their new album would be titled Paging Mr. Proust and it was released on April 29, 2016 on Thirty Tigers. Kraig Johnson left the band again before the release of Paging Mr. Proust. Jeff \\"Chet\\" Lyster was added as a touring member on guitar, pedal steel and background vocals prior to the 2016 tour. The band collaborated with Ray Davies, formerly of The Kinks, for an album released in April, 2017 titled Americana, based on Davies' experiences in the USA. The Jayhawks also backed Wesley Stace on his 2017 album Wesley Stace's John Wesley Harding. Norm Rogers, the band's drummer from 1984 to 1988, died on February 19, 2018. 2018 saw The Jayhawks backing Ray Davies again on his album Our Country - Americana Act II (released June 2018) as well as releasing their own album Back Roads and Abandoned Motels (July 2018). The band also recorded \\"What Would I Dreamer Do?\\" for the compilation album Forever Words, setting lyrics by Johnny Cash to music for the first time. On July 13, 2018 the Jayhawks released Back Roads and Abandoned Motels on Sony Legacy Recordings label, featuring new fifth member John Jackson, who co-produced the album and served previously as a touring member on some tour dates since 2014. The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

Christ and His Resurrection, fresco in Chora Church, Istanbul. An aureola or aureole (diminutive of Latin aurea, \\"golden\\") is the radiance of luminous cloud which, in paintings of sacred personages, surrounds the whole figure. In Romance languages, the noun Aureola is usually more related to the disc of light surrounding the head of sacred figures and that in English is called Halo or Nimbus. In art In the earliest periods of Christian art it was confined to the figures of the persons of the Christian Godhead, but it was afterwards extended to the Virgin Mary and to several of the saints. The aureola, when enveloping the whole body, generally appears oval or elliptical in form, but occasionally depicted as circular, vesica piscis, or quatrefoil. When it appears merely as a luminous disk round the head, it is called specifically a halo or nimbus, while the combination of nimbus and aureole is called a glory. The strict distinction between nimbus and aureole is not commonly maintained, and the latter term is most frequently used to denote the radiance round the heads of saints, angels or Persons of the Trinity. This is not to be confused with the specific motif in art of the Infant Jesus appearing to be a source of light in a Nativity scene. These depictions derive directly from the accounts given by Saint Bridget of Sweden of her visions, in which she describes seeing this.G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I,1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 76-78 & figs, =Development= The nimbus in Christian art first appeared in the 5th century, but practically the same motif was known from several centuries earlier, in pre-Christian Hellenistic art. It is found in some Persian representations of kings and gods, and appears on coins of the Kushan kings Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasudeva, as well as on most representations of the Buddha in Greco-Buddhist art from the 1st century AD. Its use has also been traced through the Egyptians to the ancient Greeks and Romans, representations of Trajan (arch of Constantine) and Antoninus Pius (reverse of a medal) being found with it. Roman emperors were sometimes depicted wearing a radiant crown, with pointed rays intended to represent the rays of the sun. According to Islamic tradition, the Prophet Mohammed may not be depicted representationally; however some religious artists have indicated his presence in historical scenes using an empty, flaming aureole as a placeholder. In the circular form the nimbus constitutes a natural and even primitive use of the idea of a crown, modified by an equally simple idea of the emanation of light from the head of a superior being, or by the meteorological phenomenon of a halo. The probability is that all later associations with the symbol refer back to an early astrological origin (compare Mithras), the person so glorified being identified with the sun and represented in the sun's image; so the aureole is the Hvareno of Mazdaism. From this early astrological use, the form of \\"glory\\" or \\"nimbus\\" has been adapted or inherited under new beliefs. =Mandorla= Christ in Majesty shown within a mandorla shape in a medieval illuminated manuscript. A mandorla is a vesica piscis shaped aureola which surrounds the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary in traditional Christian art. It is commonly used to frame the figure of Christ in Majesty in early medieval and Romanesque art, as well as Byzantine art of the same periods. The term refers to the almond like shape: \\"mandorla\\" means almond nut in Italian. In icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the Resurrection, Transfiguration, and the Ascension. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church's use of Apophatic theology, as described by Dionysius the Areopagite and others. As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness, except by darkness. In a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at Sant Climent de Ta√ºll, the inscription \\"Ego Sum Lux Mundi\\" (\\"I Am the Light of the World\\") is incorporated in the Mandorla design.Conjunt iconogr√†fic de Sant Climent de Ta√ºll The tympanum at Conques has Christ, with a gesture carved in romanesque sculpture, indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the Moon. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the Sun. Image In one special case, at Cervon (Ni√®vre), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers. At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers -the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. Here one is tempted to seek for reference in the symbolism of the nine branched Chanukkiyah candelabrum. In the 12th century a great school of Judaic thought radiated from Narbonne, coinciding with the origins of the Kabbalah. Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of Book of Revelation (22:16) Image (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete Hebrew Bible, the Leningrad Codex, one finds the Star of David imbedded in an octagon.) In the symbolism of Hildegarde von Bingen the mandorla refers to the Cosmos. Aureole (atmospheric phenomenon) In meteorology, an aureole is the inner disk of a corona, an optical phenomenon produced by the diffraction of light from the Sun or the Moon (or, occasionally, other bright light sources) by individual small water droplets and sometimes tiny ice crystals of a cloud or on a foggy glass surface.Calvert, J. B., The Corona, University of Denver, 2 August 2003. Access date 11 Feb. 2107Cowley, Les, Corona, Atmospheric Optics. Access date 11 Feb. 2107 The aureole is often (especially in case of the Moon) the only visible part of the corona and has the appearance of a bluish-white disk which fades to reddish-brown towards the edge.

It stands on the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border, adjacent to the town of Douglas, Arizona. The municipality covers an area of 3,631.65 km2 (1,402.2 sq mi). In the 2010 census the town had a population of 79,138 people, making it the seventh- largest community in the state, and a literacy rate of 96.3%. 89% of the homes in the city have electricity, 94% have running water, and 86% are connected to the sewer system. The city's most important economic activities, in descending order, are industry, commerce and farming. The city is the location of the CFE Agua Prieta power plant. History Agua Prieta city began at the end of the 19th century as railroads were built between Douglas, Arizona, and Nacozari, Sonora, to transport minerals and goods. As a result, the first settlers of the city, then just a few blocks, were those employed by the U.S. mining company Phelps Dodge Corporation, which was based in Douglas, Arizona. One can say that the town was \\"founded\\" in 1899, but it was not until a \\"contract\\" was made in 1903 between officials and private citizens, to the name Camou, that area \\"pertaining\\" to those citizens was made a Commissary of Fronteras county. Agua Prieta city did not became an \\"independent head of municipality,\\" with its current name and location, until August 28, 1916. Rodolfo L. M√°rquez was the new municipality's first president. It rose to the status of villa (town) on May 8, 1933, and it was \\"officially\\" placed in its current category of city relatively recently, on November 6, 1942.  Climate  The climate is cold semi-arid (K√∂ppen: BSk). In a latitude over the geographic subtropics, located in a plateau and in the interior of the continent gives a cold winter but at the same time a climatic pattern often dry and with great thermal amplitude during the day. And on the other hand the summer is very hot due to the absence of cloud cover and the air dry with average in the afternoon well above 30 ¬∞C. Most of the time there is no precipitation, but a considerable amount of rain falls between July and August. Culture Los Apson was one of the most successful musical bands during the second half of the 60s; all original members originated from (A)gua (P)rieta, (Son)ora, hence their name. They led the phenomenon known in Mexico as the \\"northern invasion\\". Along with the British influence, Los Apson was one of the main decisive elements that brought new nuances to the Mexican musical movement. Sports The main sport in Agua Prieta is baseball, closely followed by soccer and basketball. Agua Prieta's professional baseball team is the Toros de Agua Prieta. In 2012, Agua Prieta had its first ever Olympian when Luis Alberto Rivera represented Mexico in the long jump at the XXX Olympic Games in London, UK. Economy Agua Prieta II is the first integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) power plant in Mexico ‚Äì one of the first power plants of its type in the world ‚Äì and it is being equipped with the SPPA-E3000 low-voltage switchgear solution from Siemens Mexico Energy. Agua Prieta II is a combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) that has been extended with a solar field and parabolic trough collectors. In this type of power plant, the steam generated by the solar field is fed into the water-steam cycle of the CCPP to increase steam turbine output and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The power plant in Mexico will have an output of approximately 465 Megawatts (MW) with a contribution from the solar field of 12 MW, it will supply electricity to northwest Mexico. The end customer is the Mexican state power provider Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad, which already operates two plants of the same type in Morocco and Algeria. Agua Prieta is home to several maquiladoras, including Levolor, Commercial Vehicle Group, Takata, Velcro, Standex-Meder Electronics, and Alstyle Apparel & Activewear (Gildan).Our Communities ‚Äì Douglas Politics The Plan of Agua Prieta was a political manifesto signed in the city of Agua Prieta on April 23, 1920 by the governor of Sonora, Adolfo de la Huerta, and Plutarco El√≠as Calles in support of √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, with the principal objective of bringing an end to the presidency of Venustiano Carranza, who was forced to flee Mexico City and was killed a month later. The Plan of Agua Prieta used as its political banner the 1917 Constitution, with which Carranza had not complied. It also advocated the convening of elections, appointed Huerta as supreme commander of the Constitutionalist Army, and dictated the rules for electing a provisional president, resulting in Huerta being named president by Congress in June. Agua Prieta played an important role in the Mexican Revolution. Plutarco El√≠as Calles and L√°zaro C√°rdenas, two future presidents of Mexico, both lived in the town during its early years. In 1914, the Hotel Central, a now-demolished hotel in the center of the city, was the seat of Carranza's constitutional government. In 1915, Pancho Villa made a night attack on Agua Prieta that was repelled by the forces of Plutarco El√≠as Calles, assisted by large searchlights (possibly powered by American electricity). The Plan de Agua Prieta, a manifesto which called for the rejection of the government headed by Venustiano Carranza, was signed in a curiosity shop near the international border in 1920. The army headed by √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n eventually deposed Carranza. =List of Mayors= 1952‚Äì1954 Don Jesus Siqueiros PRI 22px 1964-1967 Antonio B.

It is located on the northern border of the Mexican state of Sonora. The city is abutted on its north by the city of Nogales, Arizona, across the U.S.-Mexico border. History The independent Nogales Municipality, which included the town of Nogales, was established on July 11, 1884.date of the publication of Law No. 29, which had been signed the previous day by the then Governor of Sonora, Luis Emeterio Torres. The Nogales Municipality covers an area of 1,675 km¬≤. Nogales was declared a city within the Municipality on January 1, 1920. =Batalla del 27 de agosto de 1918 ~ Battle of Ambos Nogales= The international trade that existed between the two cities greatly propelled the economic development of Nogales, Sonora, and the greater Northern Sonora region, but that did not prevent significant problems from forming in the area after the outbreak of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Panoramic view of the city of Nogales, Mexico, circa 1905 On August 27, 1918, at about 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the U.S. Customs house. After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the U.S. Border Patrol did not exist until 1924). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regimental soldiers and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated and several soldiers were killed and others wounded on both sides. The mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Pe√±aloza was killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane. The tomb of Felix B. Penaloza (Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, in August 1918) at the Panteon de los Heroes, Heroica Nogales, Sonora, Mexico Due in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops it was claimed they led into battle. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales prior to the August 27, 1918 battle documented the departure of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels.General DeRosey C. Cabell, ‚ÄúReport on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918,‚Äù Battle of Nogales 1918 Collection, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ). See also DeRosey C.

Furthermore, an investigation by Army officials from Fort Huachuca, Arizona, could not substantiate accusations of militant German agents in the Mexican border community and instead traced the origins of the violence to the abuse of Mexican border crossers in the year prior to the Battle of Ambos Nogales. The main result of this battle was the building of the first permanent border fence between the two cities of Nogales.‚ÄúMilitary Commanders Hold Final Conference Sunday,‚Äù Nogales Evening Daily Herald (Nogales, AZ), September 2, 1918; Daniel Arreola, ‚ÄúLa Cerca y Las Garitas de Ambos Nogales: A Postcard Landscape Exploration,‚Äù Journal of the Southwest, vol. 43 (Winter 2001), pp. 504-541 Though largely unheard of in the U.S. (and even within most of Mexico), the municipal leaders of Nogales, Sonora, successfully petitioned the Mexican Congress in 1961 to grant the Mexican border city the title of \\"Heroic City\\", leading the community's official name, Heroica Nogales, a distinction shared with the Sonoran cities of Guaymas, Caborca, and Ures, and a number of other cities in Mexico. =Escobarista Rebellion= Early in March 1929, the Escobarista Rebellion exploded in Nogales, sponsored by Obregonistas, supporters of Mexican president √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, who had been assassinated on July 17, 1928. General Manuel Aguirre, commanding the rebellious 64th Regiment, took power without firing a shot, causing federales from Naco to send a daily airplane to attack the rebels. It dropped a few bombs over Nogales without doing any damage, while the rebels fought back with machine guns from the roofs without doing any damage to the airplane. There was only one casualty, a woman who was scared by a bomb explosion and had a heart attack. That same month, a hooded man appeared at night driving a tank on Morley Street on the U.S. side, then entered Mexico to help the federales in Naco. It seems that the tank had been bought in 1927 for fighting the Yaquis, but U.S. officials prohibited it from leaving the U.S., and it had been kept in a warehouse in Nogales, Arizona. Climate Nogales has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSk) with hot summers and cool winters, often presenting freezing temperatures. Demographics , the census reported that the City of Nogales had a population of 159,103 people, representing approximately 50% growth from 1990. By the 2005 census the official population of the city was 189,759, and that of Nogales Municipality was 193,517. At the latest census in 2010, the official numbers were 212,533 for the City of Nogales, and 220,292 for the Municipality. The city and the municipality both rank third in the state in population, after Hermosillo and Ciudad Obreg√≥n. The municipality includes many outlying but small rural communities. The only other localities with over 1,000 inhabitants are La Mesa (2,996) and Centro de Readaptaci√≥n Social Nuevo (2,203) . Nogales is served by Nogales International Airport. The population growth is in part due to the influx of industry that has come since the opening of the maquiladora industry through the National Industrialization Program, decades before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). During the 90s, this economic context was, in part, held by an important Sonora state social policy by the Secretary of Urban Infrastructure and Ecology, Vernon Perez Rubio, accomplishing the city's total coverage on drinking water, with a 20-year guaranteed service.Sonora State Government. Newsletter from the Sonora State Diffusion Board, Puerto Pe√±asco County. Volume CLV, Number 40, Secc. V. 18 May 1995, Hermosillo, Sonora. Manufacturing now accounts for 55% of the city's gross domestic product, and services are growing as well, most of this caused by the growing jobs in the city. Nogales has experienced enormous population growth which covers the hills along the central narrow north-south valley. Dispersed among the houses, the visitor will find a mixture of factories, stores, etc. In 2006, the southern half of the city experienced a modern urbanization development including shopping malls, wide avenues, and modern housing conglomerations. Monuments At the center of Nogales, there is the Plaza de Benito Ju√°rez. Here there is a statue with two leading figures designed by Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just. This is a tribute to Mexican President Benito Ju√°rez, and the other is the \\"Monument to Ignorance\\", where a naked man who represents the Mexican people is fighting with a winged creature that represents ignorance. Economy =Transportation= The primary commercial artery is Mexico Federal Highway 15, which links the state with the U.S. as well as major cities in Mexico. In aviation, the city is served by the Aeropuerto internacional de Nogales, which, had no commercial airline service. =Tourism= Due to its location, Nogales is one of the most important ports of entry for U.S. tourists. The downtown area consists of bars, hotels, restaurants, and a large number of curio stores, which sell a large variety of artesanias (handicrafts, leather art, handmade flowers, clothes) brought from the deeper central and southern states of Mexico. Local dishes commonly available in restaurants include many types of antojitos (Mexican food) such as enchiladas, tacos, burritos with carne machaca (dried meat), menudo and tamales. =Manufacturing= Maquiladoras, or manufacturing plants, employ a large percentage of the population. Nogales' proximity to the U.S. and the abundance of inexpensive labor make it an efficient location for foreign companies to have manufacturing and assembly operations. Some of the companies that have established maquiladoras in Nogales include: Continental AG, The Chamberlain Group, Walbro, General Electric, Javid LLC.  Production and export  Approximately 92 establishments produce foreign exports. Sixty- five of these establishments are located in seven industrial parks, which employ approximately 25,400 workers, around 50 percent of the total employed population of the municipality. Also important to the economy is livestock for both foreign export and cattle breeding.  Agriculture  Produce is one of Mexico's largest exports to the United States and the Mariposa Port of entry, at Nogales, is the most widely used route for produce destined for the U.S. It is estimated that over 80 percent of Americas produce passes through Nogales each year. The produce industry requires facilities for the storage, packing, transport and logistics of these goods and provides many with employment on both sides of the border. November through March represent peak harvesting season and it is during these months when jobs are abundant and importation is at its highest.  Municipal government  The Nogales Municipality was governed by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for its entire history until the 2006 elections, when power shifted to the National Action Party (PAN).

The Salyut program followed this with five more successful launches of seven more stations. The final module of the program, Zvezda (DOS-8), became the core of the Russian Orbital Segment of the International Space Station and remains in orbit. Salyut 1 was modified from one of the Almaz airframes, and was made out of five components: transfer compartment, main compartment, two auxiliary compartments, and Orion 1 Space Observatory. Salyut 1 was visited by Soyuz 10 and Soyuz 11. The hard-docking of Soyuz 10 failed and the crew had to abort this mission. The Soyuz 11 crew achieved successful hard docking and performed experiments in Salyut 1 for 23 days. However, they were killed by asphyxia caused by failure of a valve just prior to Earth reentry, and were the only known people to have died above the K√°rm√°n line. Salyut 1's mission was later terminated, and it reentered on 11 October 1971.  Background  Salyut 1 originated as a modification of the military Almaz space station program then in development. After the landing of Apollo 11 on the Moon in July 1969, the Soviets began shifting the primary emphasis of their crewed space program to orbiting space stations, with a possible lunar landing later in the 1970s if the N-1 booster became flight- worthy. Leonid Brezhnev cancelled the lunar landing program in 1974. One other motivation for the space station program was a desire to one-up the United States Skylab program then in development. The basic structure of Salyut 1 was adapted from the Almaz with a few modifications and would form the basis of all Soviet space stations through Mir. Civilian Soviet space stations were internally referred to as DOS (the Russian acronym for \\"Long-duration orbital station\\"), although publicly, the Salyut name was used for the first six DOS stations (Mir was internally known as DOS-7). Several military experiments were nonetheless carried on Salyut 1, including the OD-4 optical visual ranger, the Orion ultraviolet instrument for characterizing rocket exhaust plumes, and the highly classified Svinets radiometer.  Construction and operational history  Construction of Salyut 1 began in early 1970, and after nearly a year it was shipped to the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Some remaining assembly work had yet to be done, and this was completed at the launch center. The Salyut programme was managed by Kerim Kerimov, chairman of the state commission for Soyuz missions. Launch was planned for 12 April 1971, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight on Vostok 1, but technical problems delayed it until 19 April 1971. The first crew launched later in the Soyuz 10 mission, but they ran into troubles while docking and were unable to enter the station; the Soyuz 10 mission was aborted and the crew returned safely to Earth. A replacement crew launched in Soyuz 11 and remained on board for 23 days. This was the first time in the history of spaceflight that a space station had been crewed, and a new record time was set in space. This success was, however, short-lived when the crew was killed during reentry, as a pressure-equalisation valve in the Soyuz 11 reentry capsule had opened prematurely, causing the crew to asphyxiate. They were the first and, as of 2020, the only humans to have died in space. After this accident, all missions were suspended while the Soyuz spacecraft was redesigned. The station was intentionally destroyed by de-orbiting after six months in orbit, because it ran out of fuel before a redesigned Soyuz spacecraft could be launched to it.  Structure  At launch, the announced purpose of Salyut was to test the elements of the systems of a space station and to conduct scientific research and experiments. The craft was described as being in length, in maximum diameter, and in interior space with an on-orbit dry mass of . Of its several compartments, three were pressurized, and two could be entered by the crew. = Transfer compartment = The transfer compartment was equipped with the only docking port of Salyut 1, which allowed one Soyuz 7K-OKS spacecraft to dock. It was the first use of the Soviet SSVP docking system that allowed internal crew transfer, a system that is in use today. The docking cone had a front diameter and a aft diameter. = Main compartment = The second and main compartment was about in diameter. Televised views showed enough space for eight large chairs (seven at work consoles), several control panels, and 20 portholes (some obstructed by instruments). In Salyut 1, the interior design used various colors (light and dark gray, apple green, light yellow) for supporting the astronauts' orientation in weightlessness. = Auxiliary compartments = The third pressurized compartment contained the control and communications equipment, the power supply, the life support system, and other auxiliary equipment. The fourth and final unpressurized compartment was about 2 m in diameter and contained the engine installations and associated control equipment. Salyut had buffer chemical batteries, reserve supplies of oxygen and water, and regeneration systems. Externally mounted were two double sets of solar cell panels that extended like wings from the smaller compartments at each end, the heat regulation system's radiators, and orientation and control devices. Salyut 1 was modified from one of the Almaz airframes. The unpressurized service module was the modified service module of a Soyuz craft. = Orion 1 Space Observatory = The astrophysical Orion 1 Space Observatory designed by Grigor Gurzadyan of Byurakan Observatory in Armenia, was installed in Salyut 1. Ultraviolet spectrograms of stars were obtained with the help of a mirror telescope of the Mersenne system and a spectrograph of the Wadsworth system using film sensitive to the far ultraviolet. The dispersion of the spectrograph was 32 √Ö/mm (3.2 nm/mm), while the resolution of the spectrograms derived was about 5 √Ö at 2600 √Ö (0.5 nm at 260 nm). Slitless spectrograms were obtained of the stars Vega and Beta Centauri between 2000 and 3800 √Ö (200 and 380 nm). The telescope was operated by crew member Viktor Patsayev, who became the first man to operate a telescope outside the Earth's atmosphere.

Soyuz 10 failed to hard-dock with Salyut 1 and had to abort the mission. Soyuz 11 conducted experiments in Salyut 1 for 23 days, however the cosmonauts later died during reentry in their Soyuz capsule. = Soyuz 10 = Photo of Salyut 1 with Soyuz 10 spacecraft, taken from an unknown satellite. Soyuz 10 was launched on 22 April 1971 at 23:47 GMT, carrying cosmonauts Vladimir Shatalov, Aleksei Yeliseyev, and Nikolai Rukavishnikov. After taking 24 hours for space rendezvous and approach, Soyuz 10 soft-docked with Salyut 1 on 24 April 1971 at 01:47 GMT and remained for 5.5 hours. Hard-docking was unsuccessful due to technical malfunctions. The crew could not enter the station and had to come back to Earth on 25 April 1971. = Soyuz 11 = The Soyuz 11 crew with the Salyut station in the background, in a Soviet commemorative stamp Soyuz 11 was launched on 6 June 1971 at 04:55:09 GMT and took 3 hours and 19 minutes on 7 June 1971 to complete docking. The cosmonauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Viktor Patsayev, and Vladislav Volkov entered to Salyut 1 and their mission was announced as: * Checking the design, units, onboard systems, and equipment of the orbital piloted station. * Testing the station's manual and autonomous procedures for orientation and navigation, as well as the control systems for maneuvering the space complex in orbit. * Studying Earth's surface geology, geography, meteorology, and snow and ice cover. * Studying physical characteristics, processes, and phenomena in the atmosphere and outer space in various regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. * Conducting medico- biological studies to determine the feasibility of having cosmonauts in the station perform various tasks, and studying the influence of space flight on the human organism. On 29 June 1971, after 23 days and flying 362 orbits, the mission was cut short due to problems aboard the station, including an electrical fire. The crew transferred back to Soyuz 11 and reentered the Earth's atmosphere. The capsule parachuted to a soft landing at 23:16:52 GMT in Kazakhstan, but the recovery team opened the hatch to find all three crew members dead in their couches. An inquest found that a pressure relief valve had malfunctioned during reentry leading to a loss of cabin atmosphere. The crew were not wearing pressure suits, and it was decreed that all further Soyuz missions would require the use of them.  Reentry of Salyut 1  Salyut 1 was moved to a higher orbit in July‚ÄìAugust 1971 to ensure that it would not be destroyed prematurely through orbital decay. In the meantime, Soyuz capsules were being substantially redesigned to allow pressure suits to be worn during launch, docking maneuvers, and re-entry. The Soyuz redesign effort took too long however, and by September, Salyut 1 was running out of fuel. It was decided to conclude the station's mission and on 11 October 1971, the main engines were fired for a deorbit maneuver. After 175 days, the world's first space station burned up over the Pacific Ocean. The Pravda, on 26 October 1971, reported that 75% of Salyut 1's studies were carried out by optical means and 20% by radio-technical means, while the remainder involved magnetometric, gravitational, or other measurements. Synoptic readings were taken in both the visible and invisible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

It occupies the south-eastern corner of the North Island, east of metropolitan Wellington and south-west of the Hawke's Bay region. It is lightly populated, having several rural service towns, with Masterton being the largest. It is named after its largest lake, Lake Wairarapa. The region is commonly referred to as The Wairarapa, particularly when used after a preposition (e.g., locals will say they live in the Wairarapa, and travel to and from the Wairarapa).See for example \\"About the Wairarapa,\\" wairarapanz.com; \\"The Wairarapa,\\" Lonely Planet; and \\"Wairarapa region,\\" Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand. All retrieved 17 February 2019. Boundaries Wairarapa is shaped like a rectangle, about long (from Palliser Bay north to Woodville) and wide (from the Tararua Range east to the coast). The NgƒÅti Kahungunu tribe's boundary for the region is similar. Their tribal area begins at P≈çrangahau and ends at Turakirae. It is the southernmost of their three rohe (homelands) running down the eastern North Island from Wairoa. For the RangitƒÅne tribe, Wairarapa is part of a wider homeland that includes Manawatu and Horowhenua. The north‚Äìsouth divide was reinforced in 1989, when local authority boundaries changed. The new Tararua District Council covers northern Wairarapa and southern Hawke's Bay. Central and southern Wairarapa was divided into three district councils: Masterton, Carterton and South Wairarapa. The South Wairarapa District Council, based in Martinborough, is the local government authority for areas south of Carterton, encompassing the towns of Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough and the rural areas down to the Hutt. It is separated from Upper Hutt and Lower Hutt cities by the Rimutaka Ranges.. Carterton District Council based in Carterton is the fastest growing area in New Zealand and the Masterton District Council covers areas up to the Tararua District. In terms of national politics, after the proportional representation electoral system was introduced in 1996, the Wairarapa electorate expanded to include southern Hawke's Bay. The area from Mount Bruce north, extending through Eketahuna, Pahiatua, Woodville, Dannevirke, to just north of Norsewood is part of the Tararua District and is in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region, because it is in the catchment of the headwaters of the Manawatu River. The river runs westward between the two mountain ranges (Tararua Range to the south and Ruahine Range to the north) via the Manawatu Gorge, to pass through Palmerston North and reach the west coast of the North Island. The east coast contains settlements such as Tinui, Castlepoint, and Riversdale Beach, while the main southern rivers drain through or past Lake Wairarapa to discharge into Palliser Bay east of Cook Strait. History The name means \\"Glistening Waters\\", and is said to have been applied by an early MƒÅori explorer, Haunui, who saw the rivers and lake from the mountains to the west. During colonial times the region was also known colloquially as The Wydrop. Rangitane and NgƒÅti Kahungunu were the MƒÅori tribes (iwi) in the area when European explorers arrived in the 1770s. European settlement began in the early 1840s, initially on large grazing runs leased from MƒÅori, and with closer settlement from the 1850s. On 23 January 1855 the region was hit by the strongest earthquake recorded in New Zealand, which reached Magnitude 8.2 on the Richter Scale. There were five deaths. Economy The agricultural industries, including forestry, cropping, sheep, beef and dairy farming, are major land users. The area around Martinborough, in the south, is notable for its vineyards and wine, as are the outskirts of Masterton and Carterton. Beer has been brewed at Mangatainoka, near Pahiatua, since 1889. Deer farming is growing in importance. =Transport= The region is well served by different transport modes. The State Highway 2, via Rimutaka Hill Road connects the region to Wellington in the south and the Manawatu in the north. The Wairarapa railway line connects the region via the Rimutaka Tunnel to Wellington, and connects with the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line at Woodville. A commuter rail passenger service, the Wairarapa Connection from Masterton to Wellington is operated by Tranz Metro. Many residents, especially in the southern towns such as Featherston and Greytown, commute to work in Wellington, either by train or over the Rimutaka Ranges by car.

It was the first Almaz military space station to fly. Within two weeks of its launch, the station had lost attitude control and depressurised, leaving it unusable. Its orbit decayed and it re-entered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973, without any crews having visited it. Spacecraft Salyut 2 was an Almaz military space station. It was designated part of the Salyut programme in order to conceal the existence of the two separate space station programmes. Salyut 2 was long with a diameter of , and had an internal habitable volume of . At launch it had a mass of . A single aft-mounted docking port was intended for use by Soyuz spacecraft carrying cosmonauts to work aboard the station. Two solar arrays mounted at the aft end of the station near the docking port provided power to the station, generating a total of 3,120 watts of electricity. The station was equipped with 32 attitude control thrusters, as well as two RD-0225 engines, each capable of generating of thrust, for orbital manoeuvres. Launch Salyut 2 was launched from Site 81/23 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a three-stage Proton-K rocket, serial number 283-01. The launch took place at 09:00:00 UTC on 3 April 1973, and successfully placed Salyut 2 into low Earth orbit. Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 2 was assigned the International Designator 1973-017A, whilst NORAD gave it the Satellite Catalog Number 06398. The third stage (8S812) of the Proton-K rocket entered orbit along with Salyut 2. On 4 April, it was catalogued in a orbit, inclined at 51.4 degrees. Failure Three days after the launch of Salyut 2, the Proton's spent third stage exploded, due to pressure changes within the tanks. This explosion resulted in a cloud of debris, some of which followed a similar trajectory to the station. Ten days later this debris struck the station, damaging the hull and causing depressurization. Both solar panels were torn free, removing the ability of the station to generate power and control its attitude. Three pieces of debris from the station were catalogued, and had decayed from orbit by 13 May. The remainder of the station reentered the atmosphere on 28 May 1973 over the Pacific Ocean. An inquiry into the failure initially determined that a fuel line had burst, burning a hole in the station. The damage from the debris collision was only discovered later.

It was the second Almaz military space station, and the first such station to be launched successfully. It was included in the Salyut program to disguise its true military nature.Hall and Shayer (2003). Due to the military nature of the station, the Soviet Union was reluctant to release information about its design, and about the missions relating to the station.Zimmerman (2003). It attained an altitude of 219 to 270 km on launchBond (2002). and NASA reported its final orbital altitude was 268 to 272 km. Only one of the three intended crews successfully boarded and manned the station, brought by Soyuz 14; Soyuz 15 attempted to bring a second crew but failed to dock. Although little official information has been released about the station, several sources report that it contained multiple Earth-observation cameras, as well as an on-board gun. The station was deorbited, and re-entered the atmosphere on 24 January 1975. The next space station launched by the Soviet Union was the civilian station Salyut 4; the next military station was Salyut 5, which was the final Almaz space station. Background The first space station, Salyut 1 (also called DOS-1) had been launched by the Soviet Union in April 1971. Only one mission successfully docked with Salyut 1, which was Soyuz 11, whose three-person crew stayed aboard the station for 22 days in June 1971. After undocking from the station, the Soyuz 11 crew were killed just before reentry. At the time there were competing \\"civilian\\" and pure military Soviet space programs; Salyut 1, for example, was developed as a \\"civilian\\" program. Other civilian stations, called Long-term Orbital Stations (DOS), were considered successors of Salyut 1. These consisted of the unsuccessful DOS-2 in 1972, DOS-3 in 1974, and later the successful Salyut 4, Salyut 6, and Salyut 7. The space stations funded and developed by the military, known as Almaz stations, were roughly similar in size and shape to the civilian DOS stations. But the details of their design, which is attributed to Vladimir Chelomey, are considered to be significantly different from the DOS stations. The first Almaz station was Salyut 2, which launched in April 1973, but failed only days after reaching orbit, and hence it was never manned. Description Salyut 3 consisted of an airlock chamber, a large-diameter work compartment, and a small diameter living compartment, giving a total habitable volume of 90 m¬≥. It had two solar arrays, one docking port, and two main engines, each of which could produce 400 kgf (3.9 kN) of thrust. Its launch mass was 18,900 kg. The station came equipped with a shower, a standing sleeping station, as well as a foldaway bed. The floor was covered with Velcro to assist the cosmonauts moving around the station. Some entertainment on the station included a magnetic chess set, a small library, and a cassette deck with some audio cassette tapes. Exercise equipment included a treadmill and Pingvin exercise suit. The first water-recycling facilities were tested on the station; the system was called Priboy. =Earth- observation cameras= The work compartment was dominated by the Agat-1 Earth- observation telescope, which had a focal length of 6.375 metres and an optical resolution better than three metres, according to post-Soviet sources;See Zak's website, as well as Siddiqi p.593. Another NASA source, Portree p.69, states the focal length was 10 metres; but Portree's document preceded Siddiqi's by several years, during which time more information about the specifications was gathered. NASA historian Siddiqi has speculated that given the size of the telescope's mirror, it likely had a resolution better than one metre.Siddiqi p. 593. The telescope was used in conjunction with a wide-film camera, and was used primarily for military reconnaissance purposes.Siddiqi, p.593; also Portree, p.69. The cosmonauts are said to have observed targets set out on the ground at Baikonur. Secondary objectives included study of water pollution, agricultural land, possible ore-bearing landforms, and oceanic ice formation.Portree, p.69 The cosmonauts were able to develop film while on the station. Important or interesting images were printed, and then scanned by a TV imaging system for broadcast to Earth. They needed as little as 30 minutes to shoot, develop, and scan a photograph. Less important images were packed into a small Earth-return capsule, which could be ejected from the station. In addition to the Agat-1 camera, other cameras on board included a topographical camera, a star camera, and a Volga infrared camera with a resolution of 100 metres. Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, who visited the station as the commander of Soyuz 14, recalled that the station was equipped with 14 cameras. =On-board gun= The Salyut 3, although called a \\"civilian\\" station, was equipped with a \\"self-defence\\" gun which had been designed for use aboard the station, and whose design is attributed to Alexander Nudelman. Some accounts claim the station was equipped with a Nudelman-Rikhter \\"Vulkan\\" gun, which was a variant of the 23 mm Nudelman aircraft cannon, or possibly a Nudelman NR-30 30 mm gun.James Olberg, Space Power Theory, Ch. 2 Later Russian sources indicate that the gun was the virtually unknown (in the West) Rikhter R-23.–®–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥ –ê.–ë.

(2001) Istorya aviatsionnogo vooruzhenia Harvest. ) (History of aircraft armament) p. 162 These claims have reportedly been verified by Pavel Popovich, who had visited the station in orbit, as commander of Soyuz 14. Due to potential shaking of the station, in-orbit tests of the weapon with cosmonauts in the station were ruled out. The gun was fixed to the station in such a way that the only way to aim would have been to change the orientation of the entire station. Following the last manned mission to the station, the gun was commanded by the ground to be fired; some sources say it was fired to depletion, while other sources say three test firings took place during the Salyut 3 mission. Station operations Only one manned spacecraft, Soyuz 14, docked with Salyut 3. One other spacecraft, Soyuz 15, came within 40 metres of the station, but failed to dock due to a malfunctioning rendezvous system. =Launch= The station was launched on 25 June 1974 by a three-stage Proton launch vehicle. Salyut 3 was the first space station to maintain its constant orientation relative to the Earth's surface. To achieve that, as many as 500,000 firings of the attitude control thrusters had been performed. Its initial orbit was 219 km by 270 km above mean sea level, which was considered low. The suspicions of Western observers were raised by the low altitude, combined with the choice of crew from the Soviet Air Force, and the use of radio frequencies normally designated for military use. =Soyuz 14= On 4 July, a little over a week after Salyut 3 was launched, the manned spacecraft Soyuz 14 docked with the station, having been launched the previous day. The crew of Soyuz 14 consisted of commander Pavel Popovich and flight engineer Yury Artyukhin. The crew spent 15 days aboard the station. On 9 July, it was reported that the crew activated the Earth-observation cameras, and spent several days taking photos of various locations, including central Asia. They placed some film in the Earth return capsule. After undocking, Soyuz 14 safely landed on 19 July. =Soyuz 15= The spacecraft Soyuz 15 was launched on 26 August 1974, carrying a two-man crew consisting of commander Gennadi Sarafanov and flight engineer Lev Demin. They were intended to be the second crew to man Salyut 3, but they failed to dock, after their Igla rendezvous system on their Soyuz spacecraft malfunctioned, and they were unable to manually dock.Portree, p. 27 Due to the limited battery life of their Soyuz spacecraft, they deorbited and landed two days after launch. At the time of the spaceflight, Demin was 48 years old, earning him the record for the oldest person to fly in space up to that point. This record was broken the following year, with Deke Slayton's spaceflight as a part of the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project. =Unmanned operations= Following the failed docking of Soyuz 15, it was decided that the Igla docking system needed significant modifications. Due to the amount of time needed to make the changes, and the limited time Salyut 3 had left in orbit due to orbital decay, the next planned mission to the station was cancelled. The spacecraft which would have been used on the third mission to Salyut 3 was later used for the mission Soyuz 20 to Salyut 4 (a civilian space station). Following this decision, on 23 September 1974, the station's Earth return capsule was released. The ejected capsule was deorbited by small engines. NASA sources report that the parachute of Salyut 3's capsule opened at an altitude of 8.4 km. Other sources say the main parachute did not open, and the capsule was deformed upon landing, but that all the film was recoverable. Also following the decision to not send any more cosmonauts to the station, the on-board gun was commanded by the ground to be fired; some sources say it was fired to depletion, while other sources say three test firings took place at the end of the mission. The station was deorbited on 24 January 1975 over the Pacific Ocean. See also *TKS spacecraft Notes References * SP-2000-4408.

Launched in 1976 as part of the Salyut programme, it was the third and last Almaz space station to be launched for the Soviet military. Two Soyuz missions visited the station, each manned by two cosmonauts. A third Soyuz mission attempted to visit the station, but failed to dock, whilst a fourth mission was planned but never launched. Launch Salyut 5 was launched at 18:04:00 UTC on 22 June 1976. The launch took place from Site 81/23 the Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, and used a three-stage Proton-K 8K82K carrier rocket with the serial number 290-02. Upon reaching orbit, Salyut 5 was assigned the International Designator 1976-057A, whilst the North American Aerospace Defense Command gave it the Satellite Catalog Number 08911. Spacecraft Salyut 5 was an Almaz spacecraft, the last of three to be launched as space stations after Salyut 2 and Salyut 3. Like its predecessors, it was long, with a maximum diameter of . It had a habitable interior volume of , and a mass at launch of . The station was equipped with a single docking port for Soyuz spacecraft, with the Soyuz 7K-T being the configuration in service at the time. Two solar arrays mounted laterally at the same end of the station as the docking port provided it with power. The station was equipped with a KSI capsule to return research data and materials. Salyut 5 carried Agat, a camera which the crews used to observe the Earth. The German Kristall furnace was used for crystal growth experiments aboard the station. Operation Four manned missions to Salyut 5 were originally planned. The first, Soyuz 21, was launched from Baikonur on 6 July 1976, and docked at 13:40 UTC the next day. The primary objective of the Soyuz 21 mission aboard Salyut 5 was to conduct military experiments, however scientific research was also conducted, which included studying aquarium fish in microgravity and observing the sun. The crew also conducted a televised conference with school pupils. Cosmonauts Boris Volynov and Vitali Zholobov remained aboard Salyut 5 until 24 August, when they returned to Earth landing 200 km southwest of Kokchetav. The mission had been expected to last longer, however the atmosphere within Salyut 5 became contaminated with nitric acid fumes from a fuel leak, which affected the crew's psychological and physical condition, necessitating an emergency landing. On 14 October 1976, Soyuz 23 was launched carrying Vyacheslav Zudov and Valery Rozhdestvensky to the space station. During approach for docking the next day, a faulty sensor incorrectly detected an unexpected lateral motion. The spacecraft's Igla automated docking system fired the spacecraft's maneuvering thrusters in an attempt to stop the non-existent motion. Although the crew was able to deactivate the Igla system, the spacecraft had expended too much fuel to reattempt the docking under manual control. Soyuz 23 returned to Earth on 16 October without completing its mission objectives. The last mission to Salyut 5, Soyuz 24, was launched on 7 February 1977. Its crew consisted of cosmonauts Viktor Gorbatko and Yury Glazkov, who conducted repairs aboard the station and vented the air which had been reported to be contaminated. Scientific experiments were conducted, including observation of the sun. The Soyuz 24 crew departed on 25 February. The short mission was apparently related to Salyut 5 starting to run low on propellant for its main engines and attitude control system. The fourth planned mission, which would have been designated Soyuz 25 if launched, was intended to visit the station for two weeks in July 1977. It would have been crewed by cosmonauts Anatoly Berezovoy and Mikhail Lisun; the backup crew for the Soyuz 24 mission. The mission was cancelled for the above-mentioned shortage of propellant. The spacecraft which was constructed for the Soyuz 25 mission was reused for the Soyuz 30 mission to Salyut 6. Since it could not be refuelled, and no longer had the fuel to sustain manned operations, the KSI recoverable capsule was ejected and returned to Earth on 26 February. Salyut 5 was deorbited on 8 August 1977 and burned up as it reentered the Earth's atmosphere.

The battle was a strategic reverse for the Byzantine forces, who were ambushed when moving through a mountain pass. It was to be the final, unsuccessful effort by the Byzantines to recover the interior of Anatolia from the Seljuk Turks. Background Between 1158 and 1161 a series of Byzantine campaigns against the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of R√ªm resulted in a treaty favourable to the Empire, with the sultan recognising a form of subordination to the Byzantine emperor. Immediately after peace was negotiated the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan II visited Constantinople where he was treated by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as both an honoured guest and an imperial vassal. Following this event there was no overt hostility between the two powers for many years. It was a fragile peace, however, as the Seljuks wanted to push from the arid central plateau of Asia Minor into the more fertile coastal lands, while the Byzantines wanted to recover the Anatolian territory they had lost since the Battle of Manzikert a century earlier.Magdalino, pp. 76‚Äì78 During the long peace with the Seljuks Manuel was able to concentrate his military power in other theatres. In the west, he defeated Hungary and imposed Byzantine control over all the Balkans. In the east, he recovered Cilicia from local Armenian dynasts and managed to reduce the Crusader Principality of Antioch to vassal status. However, peace with Byzantium also allowed Killij Arslan to eliminate internal rivals and strengthen his military resources. When the strongest Muslim ruler in Syria Nur ad-Din Zangi died in 1174, his successor Saladin was more concerned with Egypt and Palestine than the territory bordering the Empire. This shift in power gave Kilij Arslan the freedom to destroy the Danishmend emirates of eastern Anatolia and also eject his brother Shahinshah from his lands near Ankara. Shahinshah, who was Manuel's vassal, and the Danishmend emirs fled to the protection of Byzantium. In 1175 the peace between Byzantium and the Sultanate of R√ªm fell apart when Kilij Arslan refused to hand over to the Byzantines, as he was obliged to do by treaty, a considerable proportion of the territory he had recently conquered from the Danishmends.Magdalino, pp. 78 and 95‚Äì96 March Emperor Manuel I Komnenos The army gathered at Lopadion by Manuel was supposedly so large that it spread across ten miles, and marched towards the border with the Seljuks via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma and Antioch. Arslan tried to negotiate but Manuel was convinced of his superiority and rejected a new peace.. He sent part of the army under Andronikos Vatatzes towards Amasia while his larger force marched towards the Seljuk capital at Iconium (Konya). Both routes were through heavily wooded regions, where the Turks could easily hide and set up ambushes; the army moving towards Amasia was destroyed in one such ambush. The Turks later displayed Andronikos's head, impaled on a lance, during the fighting at Myriokephalon.. The Turks also destroyed crops and poisoned water supplies to make Manuel's march more difficult. Arslan harassed the Byzantine army in order to force it into the Meander valley, and specifically the mountain pass of Tzivritze near the fortress of Myriokephalon. Once at the pass Manuel decided to attack, despite the danger from further ambushes, and also despite the fact that he could have attempted to bring the Turks out of their positions to fight them on the nearby plain of Philomelion, the site of an earlier victory won by his grandfather Alexios. The lack of forage, and water for his troops, and the fact that dysentery had broken out in his army may have induced Manuel to decide to force the pass regardless of the danger of ambush.; . Army numbers and organisation =Byzantines= All sources agree that the Byzantine force was of exceptional size. The historian John Haldon estimates the army at 25,000‚Äì30,000 men, while John Birkenmeier puts it at around 35,000 men.Birkenmeier, p. 132. The latter number is derived from the fact that sources indicated a supply train of 3,000 wagons accompanied the army, which was enough to support 30,000‚Äì40,000 men. Birkenmeier believes that the army contained 25,000 Byzantine troops with the remainder composed of an allied contingent of Hungarians sent by Manuel's kinsman B√©la III of Hungary and tributary forces supplied by the Principality of Antioch and Serbia.The Hungarian troops were commanded by Palatine Ampud, and Leustach R√°t√≥t, Voivode of Transylvania.Birkenmeier, p. 151. The Byzantine army was divided into a number of divisions, which entered the pass in the following order: a vanguard, largely of infantry (the other divisions being composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry); the main division (of eastern and western Tagmata); then the right wing (largely composed of Antiochenes and other Westerners), led by Baldwin of Antioch (Manuel's brother-in-law); the baggage and siege trains; the Byzantine left wing, led by Theodore Mavrozomes and John Kantakouzenos; the emperor and his picked troops; and finally the rear division under the experienced general Andronikos Kontostephanos.; . =Seljuks= No estimates of Seljuk numbers for the battle have been possible. Primary sources have provided figures for other Seljuk campaigns. In 1160, John Kontostephanos defeated a force of 22,000 Seljuk Turks and about 20,000‚Äì24,000 Turks invaded the Maeander river valley in 1177.Birkenmeier, p. 54. However, modern historians have estimated that the various Seljuk successor states (such as the Sultanate of Rum) could field at most 10,000‚Äì15,000 men.Nicolle, p.24 This is likely a closer estimate for the possible Seljuk strength at Myriokephalon considering the much larger and united Seljuk Empire fielded around 20,000‚Äì30,000 men at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.Haldon, p.85 The Sultanate of Rum was much smaller territorially than the Seljuk Empire and probably had smaller armies, for example, its army at the Battle of Dorylaeum in 1097 has been estimated at between 6,000‚Äì8,000 men. The Seljuk army consisted of two main sections: the askars of the sultan and of each of his emirs, and an irregular force of Turkoman tribesmen. The askari (Arabic for 'soldier') was a full-time soldier, often a mamluk, a type of slave-soldier though this form of nominal slavery was not servile. They were supported by payments in cash or though a semi- feudal system of grants, called iqta'. These troops formed the core of field armies and were medium to heavy cavalry; they were armoured, and fought in coherent units with bow and lance. In contrast, the Turkoman tribesmen were semi-nomadic irregular horsemen, who served under their own chieftains. They lived off their herds and served the sultan on the promise of plunder, the ransom of prisoners, for one-off payments, or if their pasturelands were threatened. These tribesmen were unreliable as soldiers, but were numerous, and were effective as light mounted archers, adept at skirmish tactics.Heath (1978), pp. 32-39 This image by Gustave Dor√© shows the Turkish ambush at the pass of Myriokephalon. This ambush destroyed Manuel's hope of capturing Konya. Battle The Byzantine vanguard was the first to encounter Arslan's troops, and went through the pass with few casualties, as did the main division. Possibly the Turks had not yet fully deployed in their positions.. These divisions sent their infantry up onto the slopes to dislodge the Seljuk soldiers, who were forced to withdraw to higher ground. The following divisions did not take this precaution, also they were negligent in not maintaining a defensive formation of closed ranks and they did not deploy their archers effectively. By the time the first two Byzantine divisions exited the far end of the pass, the rear was just about to enter; this allowed the Turks to close their trap on those divisions still within the pass. The Turkish attack, descending from the heights, fell especially heavily on the Byzantine right wing. This division seems to have quickly lost cohesion and been broken, soldiers fleeing one ambush often running into another. Heavy casualties were sustained by the right-wing and its commander, Baldwin, was killed.; . The Turks then concentrated their attacks on the baggage and siege trains, shooting down the draught animals and choking the roadway. The left- wing division also suffered significant casualties and one of its leaders, John Kantakouzenos, was slain when fighting alone against a band of Seljuk soldiers.. The remaining Byzantine troops were panicked by the carnage in front of them and the realisation that the Turks had also begun to attack their rear. The sudden descent of a blinding dust-storm did nothing to improve the morale or organisation of the Byzantine forces, though it must have confused the Seljuk troops also. At this point, Manuel seems to have suffered a crisis of confidence and reputedly sat down, passively awaiting his fate and that of his army.. The emperor was eventually roused by his officers, re- established discipline and organised his forces into a defensive formation; when formed up, they pushed their way past the wreck of the baggage and out of the pass. Debouching from the pass they rejoined the unscathed van and main divisions, commanded by John and Andronikos Angelos, Constantine Makrodoukas and Andronikos Lampardas. Whilst the rest of the army had been under attack in the pass the troops of the van and main divisions had constructed a fortified encampment. The rear division, under Andronikos Kontostephanos, arrived at the camp somewhat later than the emperor, having suffered few casualties.. The night was spent in successfully repulsing further attacks by Seljuk mounted archers. Niketas Choniates states that Manuel considered abandoning his troops but was shamed into staying by the scathing words of an anonymous soldier and the disapproval of a shocked Kontostephanos.. Manuel may have had the fate of Romanos Diogenes in mind and have had some apprehension of being captured. His situation was, however, very different to that of Diogenes. Unlike the case of the earlier emperor, Manuel's troops had not dispersed from the battlefield but had drawn together following their defeat and were still capable of defending themselves. However, this would appear to be hyperbole on the historian's part as Manuel would have placed himself in much greater danger by flight than if he remained in the midst of his army. The following day, the Turks circled the camp firing arrows; Manuel ordered two counterattacks, led by John Angelos and Constantine Makrodoukas respectively, but there was no renewal of a general action.. It is notable that the two generals leading the counterattacks commanded units which had suffered negligible losses the previous day. It is probable that the Byzantine counter-attacks achieved little because, once in open country, the Seljuks were reluctant to come to close combat with the more heavily armoured Byzantine cavalry, and the Byzantines were unwilling to pursue too far for fear of further ambushes. Outcome A map of the Byzantine Empire showing the location of Myriokephalon Both sides, it appears, had suffered casualties, though their extent is difficult to quantify. Modern historians have postulated that about half of the Byzantine army was engaged and around half of those became casualties... As the Byzantine army moved back through the pass after the battle it was seen that the dead had been scalped and their genitals mutilated, \\"It was said that the Turks took these measures so that the circumcised could not be distinguished from the uncircumcised and the victory therefore disputed and contested since many had fallen on both sides.\\". Presumably, the scalping took place because the Turks wore their hair in a distinctive style. Most importantly Manuel's siege equipment had been captured and destroyed. The Byzantines, without any means of attacking Iconium, were now no longer in a position to continue the campaign. Also the Seljuk Sultan was keen for peace to be restored as soon as possible; he sent an envoy named Gabras, together with gifts of a Nisaean warhorse and a sword, to Manuel in order to negotiate a truce.. The \\"Gabras\\" who acted as emissary was possibly Iktiyar ad-Din Hasan ibn Gabras, who was Kilij Arslan's vizier. He was a member of the Gabras family of Greek origin that had ruled Trebizond earlier in the 12th century. There were a number of prominent Greek aristocrats in Seljuk employ, including Manuel's first cousin John Tzelepes Komnenos. As a result of these negotiations, the Byzantine army was to be allowed to retreat unmolested on condition that Manuel destroy his forts and evacuate the garrisons at Dorylaeum and Sublaeum in the Byzantine-Seljuk borderlands.. However, despite Kilij Arslan's protestations of good faith, the retreat of the Byzantine army was harassed by the attacks of Turkoman tribesmen (over whom Kilij Arslan probably had very little control). This, taken with an earlier failure by the sultan to keep his side of a treaty signed in 1162, gave Manuel an excuse to avoid observing the terms of this new arrangement in their entirety. He therefore demolished the fortifications of the less important fortress of Sublaeum but left Dorylaeum intact.. Manuel himself compared his defeat to that of Manzikert, sending a message to Constantinople ahead of his army likening his fate to that of Romanos Diogenes. However, in the same message he: \\"Then extolled the treaties made with the sultan, boasting that these had been concluded beneath his own banner which had waved in the wind in view of the enemy's front line so that trembling and fear fell upon them.\\". It is notable that it was the sultan who initiated peace proposals by sending an envoy to Manuel and not the reverse. The conclusion that Kilij Arslan, though negotiating from a position of strength, did not consider that his forces were capable of destroying the Byzantine army is inescapable. A possible reason for Kilij Arslan's reluctance to renew the battle is that a large proportion of his irregular troops may have been far more interested in securing the plunder they had taken than in continuing the fight, thus leaving his army seriously weakened.. Aftermath Myriokephalon, although a significant defeat for the Byzantines, did not materially affect the capabilities of the Byzantine army. This is underlined by the notable victory the Byzantines won over the Seljuks at Hyelion and Leimocheir on the Meander River the following year. Ironically, this battle was a reverse of Myriokephalon, with a Seljuk army blundering into a classic ambush laid by the Byzantine general John Komnenos Vatatzes. Manuel continued to meet the Seljuks in smaller battles with some success, and concluded a probably advantageous peace with Kilij Arslan in 1179.; . However, like Manzikert, Myriokephalon was a pivotal event and following it the balance between the two powers in Anatolia gradually began to shift, and subsequently, Byzantium was unable to compete for dominance of the Anatolian interior.Brand, p. 12 Myriokephalon had more of a psychological impact than a military impact, as it proved that the Empire could not destroy Seljuk power in central Anatolia, despite the advances made during Manuel's reign. Essentially, the problem was that Manuel had allowed himself to be distracted by a series of military adventures in Italy and Egypt, instead of dealing with the more pressing issue of the Turks. This had given the Sultan many years in which to eliminate his rivals, enabling him to build up a force capable of facing the Byzantine army in the field. Without the years required to build up Seljuk military power, the battle could not have taken place. Furthermore, during the campaign, Manuel made several serious tactical errors, such as failing to scout out the route ahead effectively and ignoring the advice of his senior officers. These failings caused him to lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. However, in defence of Manuel's generalship it is clear that he organised his army in a very effective manner. The army was composed of a number of 'divisions', each of which was self-reliant and could act as a small independent army; it has been argued that it was this organisation which allowed the greater part of his army to survive the ambush inflicted on it.Birkenmeier, p. 132 An important facet of Manuel's dispositions was that the vanguard was composed of infantry. Infantry are far better troops than cavalry when operating in mountainous terrain and it appears that the infantry van was meant to dislodge any Seljuk soldiery from the high ground dominating the pass. They signally failed to sweep the Seljuks from the pass and this failure was a major cause of the Byzantine defeat. Added to this there seems to have been a failure in generalship by the commanders of the right and left wings, who did not deploy their troops as effectively as had the commanders of the two leading divisions.. After Manuel's death, the empire drifted into anarchy, and it was never again in a position to mount a major offensive in the east. The defeat of Myriokephalon marked the end of Byzantine attempts to recover the Anatolian plateau, which was now lost to the empire forever.Haldon, p. 144 See also *Komnenian army References Further reading =Primary sources= * =Secondary sources=  Heath, I.

He was variously a novelist, poet, newspaper columnist, and playwright. He is remembered best for creating the characters Archy and Mehitabel, supposed authors of humorous verse. During his lifetime he was equally famous for creating another fictitious character, \\"the Old Soak,\\" who was the subject of two books, a hit Broadway play (1922‚Äì23), a silent movie (1926) and a talkie (1937). Life Marquis was born and grew up in Walnut, Illinois. His brother David died in 1892 at the age of 20; his father James died in 1897. After graduating from Walnut High School in 1894, he attended Knox Academy, a now-defunct preparatory program run by Knox College, in 1896, but left after three months. From 1902 to 1907 he served on the editorial board of the Atlanta Journal where he wrote many editorials during the heated election between his publisher Hoke Smith and future Pulitzer Prize winner, Clark Howell (Smith was the victor). In 1909, Marquis married Reina Melcher, with whom he had a son, Robert (1915‚Äì1921) and a daughter, Barbara (1918‚Äì1931). Reina died on December 2, 1923. Three years later Marquis married the actress Marjorie Potts Vonnegut, whose first husband, actor Walter Vonnegut, was a cousin of American author, playwright and satirist Kurt Vonnegut Jr. She died in her sleep on October 25, 1936. Marquis died of a stroke in New York City, after suffering three other strokes that partly disabled him. On August 23, 1943, the United States Navy christened a Liberty ship, the , in his memory. Career Marquis began work for the New York newspaper The Evening Sun in 1912 and edited for the next eleven years a daily column, \\"The Sun Dial\\". During 1922 he left The Evening Sun (shortened to The Sun in 1920) for the New York Tribune (renamed the New York Herald Tribune in 1924), where his daily column, \\"The Tower\\" (later \\"The Lantern\\") was a great success. He regularly contributed columns and short stories to the Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and American magazines and also appeared in Harper's, Scribner's, Golden Book, and Cosmopolitan. Marquis's best-known creation was Archy, a fictional cockroach (developed as a character during 1916) who had been a free-verse poet in a previous life, and who supposedly left poems on Marquis's typewriter by jumping on the keys. Archy usually typed only lower-case letters, without punctuation, because he could not operate the shift key. His verses were a type of social satire, and were used by Marquis in his newspaper columns titled \\"archy and mehitabel\\"; mehitabel was an alley cat, occasional companion of archy and the subject of some of archy's verses. The archy and mehitabel pieces were illustrated by cartoonist George Herriman, better known to posterity as the author of the newspaper comic Krazy Kat. Other characters developed by Marquis included Pete the Pup, Clarence the ghost, and an egomaniacal toad named Warty Bliggins. Marquis was the author of about 35 books. He co-wrote (or contributed posthumously) to the films The Sports Pages, Shinbone Alley, The Good Old Soak and Skippy. The 1926 film The Cruise of the Jasper B was supposedly based on his 1916 novel of the same name, although the plots have little in common.

A lifelong member of the Actors Studio, in 1971, O'Connor found widespread fame as Archie Bunker (for which he won 4 Emmy Awards), the main character in the CBS television sitcoms All in the Family (1971‚Äì79) and its spinoff, Archie Bunker's Place (1979‚Äì83). O'Connor later starred in the NBC/CBS television crime drama In the Heat of the Night (1988‚Äì95), where he played the role of Sparta, Mississippi, police chief William \\"Bill\\" Gillespie. At the end of his career in the late 1990s, he played Gus Stemple, the father of Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt) on Mad About You. In 1996, O'Connor was ranked number 38 on TV Guides 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time. He won 5 Emmys and two Golden Globe Awards. Early life Carroll O'Connor, an Irish American, was the eldest of three sons. He was born on August 2, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, to Edward Joseph O'Connor, a lawyer, and his wife, Elise Patricia O'Connor. Both of his brothers became doctors: Hugh, who died in a motorcycle accident in 1961, and Robert, a psychiatrist in New York City. O'Connor spent much of his youth in Elmhurst and Forest Hills, Queens, the same borough in which his character Archie Bunker would later live.Severo, Richard. \\"Carroll O'Connor, Embodiment of Social Tumult as Archie Bunker, Dies at 76\\", The New York Times, June 22, 2001. Accessed November 18, 2007. \\"The O'Connors lived well, at first in the Bronx, later in a larger apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, and finally in a nice single-family home in Forest Hills, Queens, then an enclave for people of means.\\" O'Connor graduated from Newtown High School in Elmhurst. In 1941, he enrolled at Wake Forest University in North Carolina but dropped out when the United States entered World War II. During the war, he was rejected by the United States Navy and enrolled in the United States Merchant Marine Academy for a short time. After leaving that institution, he became a merchant seaman and served in the United States Merchant Marine during the war. After the war, O'Connor attended the University of Montana, where he worked at the Montana Kaimin student newspaper as an editor; in 1949 he resigned his editing position in protest to the pressure from the campus administration that led to the confiscation and destruction of an issue of the paper, which carried a cartoon depicting the Montana Board of Education as rats gnawing at a bag of university funds. At the University of Montana, he also joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. O'Connor did not take any drama courses as an undergraduate at the University of Montana, but he did act in student theater productions. He met Nancy Fields (born 1929), who later became his wife, when she was working as a makeup artist on a student play he was acting in. He later left that university to help his younger brother Hugh get into medical school in Ireland, where Carroll completed his studies at University College Dublin, where he studied Irish history and English literature, and began his acting career. After O'Connor's fianc√©e, Nancy Fields, graduated from the University of Montana in 1951 with degrees in drama and English, she sailed to Ireland to study at Trinity College Dublin and meet Carroll, who was visiting his brother, Hugh. The couple married in Dublin on July 28, 1951. In 1956, O'Connor returned to the University of Montana to earn a master's degree in speech. Prolific character actor After acting in theatrical productions in Dublin and New York during the 1950s, O'Connor's breakthrough came when he was cast by director Burgess Meredith (assisted by John Astin) in a featured role in the Broadway adaptation of James Joyce's novel Ulysses. O'Connor and Meredith remained close, lifelong friends. O'Connor made his television acting debut as a character actor on two episodes of Sunday Showcase. These two parts led to other roles on such television series as The Americans, The Eleventh Hour, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, The Fugitive, The Wild Wild West, Armstrong Circle Theatre, The Outer Limits, The Great Adventure, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Dr. Kildare, I Spy, That Girl, Premiere and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, among many others. O'Connor starred as an Eastern European villain in the first season of Mission Impossible, season one, episode 18 \\"The Trial\\". Late in his career, he appeared on several episodes of Mad About You as the father of Helen Hunt's character. =Considered roles= He was among the actors considered for the roles of the Skipper on Gilligan's Island and Dr. Smith in the TV show Lost in Space, and he was the visual template in the creation of Batman nemesis Rupert Thorne, a character who debuted at the height of All in the Family's success in Detective Comics No. 469 (published May 1976 by DC Comics). Early film roles O'Connor appeared in a number of studio films in the 1960s and early 1970s, including Lonely Are the Brave (1962), Cleopatra (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), What Did You Do in the War, Daddy? (1966), Hawaii (1966), Not with My Wife, You Don't! (1966), Warning Shot (1967), Point Blank (1967), The Devil's Brigade (1968), For Love of Ivy (1968), Death of a Gunfighter (1969), Marlowe (1969), Kelly's Heroes (1970) and Doctors' Wives (1971). In many of his roles he portrayed a military or police officer, in several a particularly blustery one. Television roles O'Connor was cast in the 1963 episode of Death Valley Days, \\"A Gun Is Not a Gentleman,\\" as U.S. Senator David C. Broderick, a California Democrat. In the storyline, Broderick, who has never used a gun, is challenged to a duel by former political ally, former California Supreme Court justice David S. Terry (Brad Dexter). Broderick was an abolitionist; Terry, pro-slavery. After he fatally shoots Broderick, Terry is tried, but the case is dismissed. =All in the Family= Publicity photo of O'Connor and Jean Stapleton in All in the Family, 1973 O'Connor was living in Italy in 1968 when producer Norman Lear first asked him to come to New York City and star in a series which he was creating for ABC with the title Justice For All, with O'Connor playing Archie Justice, a lovable yet controversial bigot. After three television pilots of the sitcom were produced between 1968 and 1970, the network that was supposed to broadcast it was changed to CBS, the last name of its main character was changed to Bunker, and its title was changed to All in the Family. The show was based on the BBC's Till Death Us Do Part, and Bunker was based on Alf Garnett, but he was somewhat less abrasive than the original British character. O'Connor's Queens background and his New York accent both influenced Lear to set the show in Queens. Wanting a well-known actor to play the lead, Lear approached Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney: both of them declined. O'Connor accepted the role because he did not expect the show to be a success, and he believed that he would be able to move back to Europe when it failed. In her book Archie & Edith, Mike & Gloria: the Tumultuous History of All in the Family, Donna McCrohan noted that O'Connor requested that Lear provide him with a return airplane ticket to Rome as a condition of his acceptance of the role, so he could return to Italy when the show failed. Instead, 'All in the Family' became the highest-rated show on American television for five consecutive seasons. O'Connor's own politics were liberal. He understood the Bunker character and played him not only with bombast and humor but with touches of vulnerability. The writing on the show was consistently left of center, but O'Connor, while personifying right wing views, also often deftly skewered the liberal pieties of the day. Bunker was famous for his English language malapropisms; O'Connor was in truth a highly educated and cultured man and taught English before he turned to acting. Archie Bunker's long-suffering wife Edith was played by Jean Stapleton, also from New York City, a Broadway actress whom Lear remembered from the play and film Damn Yankees. The show also starred unknown character actors, such as Rob Reiner as Archie's liberal son-in-law, Michael \\"Meathead\\" Stivic, and Sally Struthers as Archie and Edith's only child and Mike's wife, Gloria. The cast had a unique on- and off-camera chemistry, especially between O'Connor and Reiner, who became best friends. CBS was unsure whether the controversial subject matter of All in the Family would fit well into a sitcom. Racial issues, ethnicities, religions, class, education, women's equality, gun control, politics, inflation, the Vietnam War, energy crisis, Watergate and other timely topics of the 1970s were addressed. Like its British predecessor Till Death Us Do Part, the show lent dramatic social substance to the traditional sitcom format. Archie Bunker's popularity made O'Connor a top- billing star of the 1970s. O'Connor was afraid of being typecast for playing the role, but at the same time he was protective, not just of his character, but of the entire show. A contract dispute between O'Connor and Lear marred the beginning of the show's fifth season. Eventually O'Connor got a raise and appeared in the series until it ended. For his work as Archie Bunker, he was nominated for eight Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series; he won the award four times (1972, 1977, 1978 and 1979). At the end of the eighth season in 1978, Reiner and Struthers left the series to pursue other projects, but O'Connor and Stapleton still had one year left on their contracts. Rob Reiner said in a 2014 interview about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, \\"We did over 200 shows in front of a live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences like, what they don't like, how stories are structured. I would spend a lot of time in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me, and I took from all the people who were around.\\" He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: \\"Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad.\\" =Archie Bunker's Place= When All in the Family ended after nine seasons, Archie Bunker's Place continued in its place and ran for four additional years. Longtime friend and original series star Jean Stapleton kept her role as Edith Bunker, but she was limited to about a half dozen guest appearances in season one. In the second- season premiere, her character died of a stroke, leaving Archie to cope with the loss. The show was canceled in 1983. O'Connor was angered about the show's cancelation, maintaining that the show ended with an inappropriate finale. He vowed never to work in any type of show with CBS again, although he starred in In the Heat of the Night, which aired on CBS, in that show's last three seasons. =In the Heat of the Night= While coping with his son's drug problem, O'Connor starred as Sparta, Mississippi, Police Chief Bill Gillespie, a tough veteran cop on In the Heat of the Night. Based on the novel by John Ball and the 1967 movie of the same name, the series debuted on NBC in March 1988 and performed well. He cast his son Hugh O'Connor as Officer Lonnie Jamison. The headquarters of the Sparta Police Department was actually the library in Covington, Georgia. In 1989, while working on the set, O'Connor was hospitalized and underwent open heart surgery, which caused him to miss four episodes at the end of the second season (Actor Joe Don Baker took his place in those episodes as an acting police chief.) O'Connor would later serve as one of the executive producers for the series, starting with the third season. The series was transferred from NBC to CBS in 1992 and cancelled two years later after its seventh season. O'Connor reprised his role the following year for four two-hour In the Heat of the Night television films to critical acclaim. While on the series, O'Connor recorded \\"Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella\\" for the 1991 In the Heat of the Night Christmas CD Christmas Time's A Comin'. He was joined by Grand Ole Opry star mandolinist Jesse McReynolds, Nashville accordionist Abe Manuel Jr., and Nashville fiddlers Buddy Spicher and Randall Franks. CD Producer and series co-star Randall Franks created the arrangement which was co-produced by series co-star Alan Autry. He joined other members of the cast for a recording of \\"Jingle Bells\\" with vocals by Country Music Hall of Fame members Little Jimmy Dickens, Kitty Wells, Pee Wee King, The Marksmen Quartet, Bobby Wright, Johnnie Wright and Ken Holloway. According to MeTV, Carroll wrote several episodes under the pseudonym Matt Harris.

O'Connor is the only male actor to have won the lead acting Emmy Award in both the comedy and drama series categories. In July 1991, O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Reiner, and Sally Struthers were reunited to celebrate the 20th anniversary of All in the Family. Due to reruns which aired in syndication, TV Land, Antenna TV, and CBS, the show's popularity continued. In March 2000, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was given a St. Patrick's Day tribute by MGM. His caricature is displayed at Sardi's restaurant in New York City's Theater District. Personal life In 1962, while he was in Rome filming Cleopatra, O'Connor and his wife, Nancy Fields O'Connor,The Missoulian. November 13, 2014. Briggeman, Kim. \\"Missoula's Mrs. Archie Bunker - Nancy O'Connor - dies at 84 in Malibu\\" adopted a six-day-old boy, naming him Hugh after O'Connor's brother who had died a year earlier. At age 17, Hugh worked as a courier on the set of Archie Bunker's Place. O'Connor eventually created the role of Officer Lonnie Jamison on In the Heat of the Night for his son. In 1989, O'Connor was admitted to the hospital for heart bypass surgery and quit his 30-year smoking habit. On March 28, 1995, O'Connor's son Hugh took his own life after a long battle with drug addiction. Following his son's death, O'Connor appeared in public service announcements for Partnership for a Drug Free America and spent the rest of his life working to raise awareness about drug addiction. O'Connor also successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation allowing family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer's actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and rehabilitation costs and other economic and noneconomic damages. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Civil Liability Act in California, went into effect in 1997. It is also referred to as the Hugh O'Connor Memorial Law. The act is based on the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. The Model Drug Dealer Liability Act has been passed in 17 states and the Virgin Islands. A website devoted to the Act can be found at: www.ModelDDLA.com. Cases have been brought under the Act in California, Illinois, Utah, and other states. His son's suicide inspired O'Connor to start a crusade against the man who sold the drugs to Hugh. He called Harry Perzigian \\"a partner in murder\\" and a \\"sleazeball\\". Perzigian filed a defamation lawsuit against the actor. In 1997, a California jury decided in O'Connor's favor. In an interview on CNN's Larry King Live soon after the verdict, O'Connor said he would never be able to put his son's death behind him. \\"I can't forget it. There isn't a day that I don't think of him and want him back and miss him, and I'll feel that way until I'm not here any more,\\" he said. During the late 1990s, O'Connor established a small automotive restoration shop in Newbury Park, California. Called \\"Carroll O'Connor Classics\\", the shop contained many of O'Connor's personal vehicles and the cars once owned by his late son. Among the cars O'Connor owned were a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow sold to him by William Harrah, a Maserati 3500 GT, and a Dodge Challenger equipped with the 440-cubic inch V-8 that was the car he drove during production of All in the Family. In 1997, the O'Connors donated US$1 million (worth $ today) to their alma mater to help match a challenge grant to the University of Montana from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The university named a regional studies and public policy institute the O'Connor Center for the Rocky Mountain West. Afterward, O'Connor taught screenwriting at the university. In 1998, O'Connor underwent a second surgery to clear the blockage in a carotid artery, to reduce his risk of stroke. Death Carroll O'Connor's grave O'Connor died on June 21, 2001, in Culver City, California, from a heart attack due to complications from diabetes at age 76. His funeral Mass was celebrated at St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, and was attended by All in the Family cast members Rob Reiner, Sally Struthers, and Danielle Brisebois, as well as producer Norman Lear. Jean Stapleton, who had been a close friend of O'Connor's since the early 1960s, did not attend the service due to a commitment for a stage performance. O'Connor's best friend Larry Hagman and his family were also there, alongside the surviving cast of In the Heat of the Night, including Alan Autry and Denise Nicholas, who also attended the Mass. Actor Martin Sheen, then starring on The West Wing, delivered the eulogy. O'Connor's body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery with his son Hugh's cenotaph placed on his gravestone. In honor of O'Connor's career, TV Land moved an entire weekend of programming to the next week and showed a continuous marathon of All in the Family. During the commercial breaks, TV Land also showed interview footage of O'Connor and various All in the Family actors, producers with whom he had worked, and other associates. His wife, Nancy Fields O'Connor, died November 10, 2014, at age 84.

Founded in 1837, it was the first historically black institute. It is a member of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. The university offers bachelor's degrees. The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. History Melrose Cottage, built in 1805. Library Built on land donated by the prominent Cheyney family, the university was founded as the African Institute in February 1837 and renamed the Institute of Colored Youth (ICY) in April 1837, Cheyney University is the oldest African-American institution of higher learning. Unlike Lincoln University and some others HBCUs, Cheyney did not award degrees until 1914, when it adopted the curriculum of a normal school (teacher training). The African Institute was founded by Richard Humphreys, a Quaker philanthropist who bequeathed $10,000 (), one-tenth of his estate, to design and establish a school to educate people of African descent and prepare them as teachers. Born on a plantation on Tortola, an island in the British West Indies, Humphreys came to Philadelphia in 1764. Many Quakers were abolitionists, and he became concerned about the struggles of free people of color to make a living and gain education in a discriminatory society. News of a race riot against free blacks in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1829 inspired Humphreys to bequeath money in his will for higher education for free blacks. He charged thirteen fellow Quakers to design an institution \\"to instruct the descendents of the African Race in school learning, in the various branches of the mechanic Arts, trades and Agriculture, in order to prepare and fit and qualify them to act as teachers ...\\" Founded as the African Institute, the school was soon renamed the Institute for Colored Youth. In its early years, it provided training in trades and agriculture, as those were the predominant skills needed in the general economy. In 1902 the Institute was relocated to George Cheyney's farm, a 275-acre property west of Philadelphia. The name \\"Cheyney\\" became associated with the school in 1913. The school's official name changed several times during the 20th century. In 1983, Cheyney was taken into the State System of Higher Education as Cheyney University of Pennsylvania. The university has traditionally offered opportunities to many students from Philadelphia's inner city schools. Its alumni have close ties in the city and state. It became part of a 1980 civil rights lawsuit against the state government; it alleged that the state had unlawfully underfunded the historically black university. The suit was settled 19 years later in 1999. This was five years after the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights began investigating states \\"that once practiced segregation in higher education and were never officially found to have eliminated it.\\" In the settlement, the state agreed to provide $35 million to Cheyney over a five-year period, particularly for construction of needed buildings and academic development. By comparison, the university had an annual budget of about $23 million at the time. In November 2015, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education placed Cheyney University on probation. Three years later, the commission placed the university on \\"show cause\\" status which required the university to show cause by November 21, 2019, for showing compliance with the commission's standards or accreditation would not be renewed. The accreditation concerns were driven by the university's financial woes, a concern the university sought to address in part with increased fundraising. On November 21, 2019 the Middle States Commission on Higher Education reaffirmed Cheyney's accreditation as \\"...the institution is now in compliance with Standard VI (Planning, Resources, and Institutional Improvement) and Requirement of Affiliation 11.\\" The Middle States commission will continue to monitor financial stability of the university, with a report from Cheyney due to the commission on March 1, 2020. =Presidents= *Aaron A.

Burleigh Hall (1928) is named for Harry T. Burleigh, the first critically successful African American composer and a major international figure in the world of music in the 20th century. His works include ‚ÄúNobody Knows the Trouble I‚Äòve Seen‚Äù. Burleigh also provided insight for the composition of the Cheyney Alma Mater, written by Leslie Pinckney Hill. The building, which forms the eastern end of the historic Quadrangle, was 1842 to 1875. Cope was instrumental in helping to raise funds for the institute throughout his long and loyal tenure as a board member. Browne Hall Hugh M. Browne Hall (1938) was originally constructed as a home economics center, and is named for Hugh Mason Browne, who was principal of the school from 1903 to 1913. It subsequently served as Cheyney's reception center, and housing for several administrative offices. Current plans call for renovation after which it will house high achieving students. Dudley Hall Dudley Hall (1931), named for Mildred B. Dudley a pioneering music faculty member, was formerly named Pennsylvania Hall. Dudley Hall was originally a gymnasium and later the home of the music department. After a renovation it became a fine arts center and theatre for student productions. The Dudley theatre has seen performances by Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, in addition to highly regarded student productions. Carnegie Library Andrew Carnegie Hall (1909) is located on the quadrangle and is named for one of America's most famous philanthropists, the steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919). Carnegie had a passion for libraries and donated millions for the construction of libraries across the United States. Carnegie donated funding ($10,000) for the first library building constructed for the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) in 1909. The building served as library, cafeteria, and gymnasium and study area. In 1962 an addition was constructed for classroom use, and later housed the business department. After a renovation, the grand hall is now used for special receptions. Emlen Hall Emlen Hall (1904) is named for Samuel Emlen, Quaker board member, and the founder of the Emlen Institute in Philadelphia, from whose estate the ICY had earlier received considerable financial aid. Construction on Emlen was begun in 1904 and completed in 1905. Emlen was originally a dormitory for women; however, later it was used for staff housing, business support services, and the business school. Currently, it is used for housing for the Keystone Honor Academy Students. Only these honor students are offered the privilege to stay in the historic building. Humphreys Hall Richard Humphreys Hall (1903), located on the historic quadrangle, was the very first building constructed under the governance of the Quaker Board of Governors. Construction began in 1903, and the building was in use by 1904. Named in honor of Richard Humphreys (1750-1832), the Quaker philanthropist and founder of the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY), who's will, bequeathed the generous donation that enabled the establishment of the institution in 1837. Humphreys Hall has variously been used as a classroom building, industrial building, co-educational dormitory, and combination dining- room/kitchen. Originally called the ‚ÄúIndustrial Building‚Äù, it was dedicated ‚ÄúHumphreys Hall‚Äù in honor of Richard Humphreys in June 1906. After an extensive renovation, the new use of the building is to house Humphrey's Scholars. Biddle Hall Biddle Hall James G. Biddle Hall (1938), an administration building, is named for James G. Biddle who served on the Cheyney Board from 1912 until his death in 1947. When then-Cheyney Training School for Teachers was purchased by the Commonwealth, he became Chairman of the Board of Trustees appointed by the governor. The building previously housed the computer center and math and computer sciences department. After a later renovation, it currently houses offices for the President, Vice Presidents for Student Affairs, and Institutional Advancement, and an art gallery. On the Quad, it is located across from Browne Hall, is parallel to Humphries Hall and diagonal from Burleigh Hall. = Other buildings = Marian Anderson Music Center Marian Anderson Music Center (1970) is named for the internationally famous contralto from Philadelphia, who performed at Cheyney, and attended the center's dedication ceremony. The classroom building with accompanying auditorium also contains practice suites. The 36,000 square foot facility contains state-of-the-art acoustics and a wireless communication system installed. Marian Anderson (1897-1993) was one of the most celebrated contraltos of the twentieth century. Marcus A. Foster Student Alumni Center Marcus A. Foster Student Alumni Center (1970), is named in honor of Marcus Foster, a Cheyney alumnus (class of 1946), and renowned educator, who was assassinated while serving with distinction as superintendent of the Oakland, California, public school system. An addition was constructed in 1975, with accommodations for student and administrative offices, bookstore, lounges, and an auditorium. Currently, it also houses on the third floor a state-of-the-art computer lab, updated in 2016. Leslie Pinckney Hill Library Leslie Pinckney Hill Library (1974) was named for Dr. Leslie Pinckney Hill (1880-1960), the first president of Cheyney who led the school for thirty-eight years, from 1913 to 1951. The tri-level building is nearly four times the size of the original Carnegie Library that it replaced. Among its treasures are portraits by Laura Wheeler Waring. The library also houses the University Archives. It received an extensive renovation in 2016. Vaux Hall Vaux Hall (1960) was constructed as the industrial arts center. Named for two Quaker financial supporters of the Institute, George Vaux, Sr. and George Vaux, Jr. Both men furthered Humphreys' bequest for the Institute for Colored Youth, including the Emlen Trust via vigorous fundraising. Vaux Hall served metal technology, drafting and CAD applications, photography, radio and broadcast sciences and printing graphics technology which was a staple of Cheyney University through the early 1990s. Vaux continues in its importance today to the fine arts, and information technology. Wade Wilson Administration Center Wade Wilson Administration Center (1979) was named for Dr. Wade Wilson (1914-1988), an alumnus, former star athlete, and industrial arts professor. Dr. Wilson was the fourth president of Cheyney University, and served as president from 1968 to 1981. During his tenure as president Dr. Wilson was an active presence in the legislative arena on behalf of the university. The Wade Wilson building was built in 1980 and occupied in 1981 as the new location for the Office of the President. Later, other administrative offices were moved to the building. Currently, the building houses the offices of the Provost, the Office of the Vice President for Finance, the mailroom, registrar, Human Resources, Financial Aid, and related support offices. Athletics Cheyney University has one of the most storied basketball programs in NCAA Division II history. The men's basketball program is 7th all-time in NCAA win percentage, including 16 PSAC conference championships, four Final Fours, and one National Championship (1978). The women's basketball team in 1982 competed in the championship game of the inaugural NCAA Division I tournament despite being a Division II school. In 2009, Cheyney University hired the first ever NCAA men's and women's basketball coaches who are brother and sister. The men's coach was Dominique Stephens, a North Carolina Central University graduate and member of the NCAA Division II Basketball Championship team, and the women's coach was Marilyn Stephens, the Temple University Hall of Famer. During the 2007-08 through 2010-11 academic years, the university violated NCAA rules in the certification of initial, transfer and continuing eligibility involving all sports programs. During the four-year period, numerous student-athletes competed while ineligible due to improper certification. In amateurism certification alone, 109 student-athletes practiced, competed and received travel expenses and/or athletically related financial aid before the university received their amateurism certification status from the NCAA Eligibility Center. The committee also concluded that a former compliance director failed to monitor when she did not follow proper procedures in the certification of student-athletes‚Äô eligibility. The entire athletics program is on probation until August 2019.National Collegiate Athletic Association#Division II institutions on probation In spring 2018, the team will withdraw from Division II and play the following season as an independent, citing financial problems.

The Golden Legend (Latin: Legenda aurea or Legenda sanctorum) is a collection of hagiographies by Jacobus de Varagine that was widely read in late medieval Europe. More than a thousand manuscripts of the text have survived.Hilary Maddocks, \\"Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the L√©gende dor√©e\\", in Margaret M. Manion, Bernard James Muir, eds. Medieval texts and images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages 1991:2; a study of the systemization of the Latin manuscripts of the Legenda aurea is B.

Legenda Aurea: sept si√®cles de diffusion\\", 1986:19-24 It was likely compiled around the years 1259‚Äì1266, although the text was added to over the centuries.An introduction to the Legenda, its great popular late medieval success and the collapse of its reputation in the 16th century, is Sherry L. Reames, The Legenda Aurea: a reexamination of its paradoxical history, University of Wisconsin, 1985. Illustration for Golden Legend, 1493 Saint Margaret attracts the attention of the Roman prefect, by Jean Fouquet from an illuminated manuscript Initially entitled Legenda sanctorum (Readings of the Saints), it gained its popularity under the title by which it is best known. It overtook and eclipsed earlier compilations of abridged legendaria, the Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum attributed to the Dominican chronicler Jean de Mailly and the Epilogus in gestis sanctorum of the Dominican preacher Bartholomew of Trent. When printing was invented in the 1450s, editions appeared quickly, not only in Latin, but also in almost every major European language. Among incunabula, printed before 1501, Legenda aurea was printed in more editions than the Bible and was one of the most widely published books of the Middle Ages. During the height of its popularity the book was so well known that the term \\"Golden Legend\\" was sometimes used generally to refer to any collection of stories about the saints. It was one of the first books William Caxton printed in the English language; Caxton's version appeared in 1483 and his translation was reprinted, reaching a ninth edition in 1527. Written in simple, readable Latin, the book was read in its day for its stories. Each chapter is about a different saint or Christian festival. The book is considered the closest thing to an encyclopaedia of medieval saint lore that survives today; as such, it is invaluable to art historians and medievalists who seek to identify saints depicted in art by their deeds and attributes. Its repetitious nature is explained if Jacobus da Varagine meant to write a compendium of saintly lore for sermons and preaching, not a work of popular entertainment. Lives of the saints The book sought to compile traditional lore about saints venerated at the time of its compilation, ordered according to their feast days. Jacobus da Varagine for the most part follows a template for each chapter: etymology of the saint's name, a narrative about their life, a list of miracles performed, and finally a list of citations where the information was found. Each chapter typically begins with an etymology for the saint's name, \\"often entirely fanciful\\". An example (in Caxton's translation) shows his method: As a Latin author, Jacobus da Varagine must have known that Silvester, a relatively common Latin name, simply meant \\"from the forest\\". The correct derivation is alluded to in the text, but set out in parallel to fanciful ones that lexicographers would consider quite wide of the mark. Even the \\"correct\\" explanations (silvas, \\"forest\\", and the mention of green boughs) are used as the basis for an allegorical interpretation. Jacobus da Varagine's etymologies had different goals from modern etymologies, and cannot be judged by the same standards. Jacobus' etymologies have parallels in Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae, in which linguistically accurate derivations are set out beside allegorical and figurative explanations. Jacobus da Varagine then moves on to the saint's life, compiled with reference to the readings from the Roman Catholic Church's liturgy commemorating that saint; then embellishes the biography with supernatural tales of incidents involving the saint's life. =Medieval view of Muhammad= The chapter \\"St Pelagius, Pope and the History of the Lombards\\" begins with the story of St Pelagius, then proceeds to touch upon events surrounding the origin and history of the Lombards in Europe leading up to the 7th century when the story of Muhammad begins. The story then goes on to describe \\"Magumeth (Mahomet, Muhammad)\\" as \\"a false prophet and sorcerer\\", detailing his early life and travels as a merchant through his marriage to the widow, Khadija and goes on to suggest his \\"visions\\" came as a result of epileptic seizures and the interventions of a renegade Nestorian monk named Sergius. The chapter conveys the medieval Christian understanding of the beliefs of Saracens and other Muslims. It may be because of this long history that early copies of the entire work was sometimes referred to as Historia Lombardica. Legenda Aurea. =Miracle tales of relics= Many of the stories also conclude with miracle tales and similar wonderlore from accounts of those who called upon that saint for aid or used the saint's relics. Such a tale is told of Saint Agatha; Jacobus da Varagine has pagans in Catania repairing to the relics of St. Agatha to supernaturally repel an eruption of Mount Etna: > And for to prove that she had prayed for the salvation of the country, at > the beginning of February, the year after her martyrdom, there arose a great > fire, and came from the mountain toward the city of Catania and burnt the > earth and stones, it was so fervent. Then ran the paynims to the sepulchre > of S. Agatha and took the cloth that lay upon her tomb, and held it abroad > against the fire, and anon on the ninth day after, which was the day of her > feast, ceased the fire as soon as it came to the cloth that they brought > from her tomb, showing that our Lord kept the city from the said fire by the > merits of S. Agatha.\\"The Life of St. Agatha.\\" The Golden Legend or Lives of > the Saints. Compiled by Jacobus de Varagine. Trans. William Caxton. Ed. F. > S. Ellis. London: Temple Classics, 1900. Reproduced at > www.Aug.edu/augusta/iconography/goldenLegend, Augusta State University. Sources The life of St. Barbara, a virgin who turned to Christianity against the will of her pagan father, is mostly known from the Golden Legend. The Walters Art Museum Jacobus carefully lists many of the sources he used to collect his stories, with more than 120 total sources listed; among the three most important are Historia Ecclesiastica by Eusebius, Tripartate History by Cassiodorus, and Historia scholastica by Petrus Comestor. However, scholars have also identified other sources which Jacobus did not himself credit. A substantial portion of Jacobus' text was drawn from two epitomes of collected lives of the saints, both also arranged in the order of the liturgical year, written by members of his Dominican order: one is Jean de Mailly's lengthy Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum (Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints) and the other is Bartholomew of Trent's Epilogum in gesta sanctorum (Afterword on the Deeds of the Saints).Hilary Maddocks, \\"Pictures for aristocrats: the manuscripts of the L√©gende dor√©e\\", in Margaret M. Manion and Bernard James Muir, eds.,Medieval Texts and Images: studies of manuscripts from the Middle Ages 1991:2 note 4. The many extended parallels to text found in Vincent de Beauvais' Speculum historiale, the main encyclopedia that was used in the Middle Ages, are attributed by modern scholars to the two authors' common compilation of identical sources, rather than to Jacobus' reading Vincent's encyclopedia.Christopher Stace, tr., The Golden Legend: selections (Penguin), \\"Introduction\\" pp. xii‚Äìxvi, reporting conclusions of K. Ernest Geith, (Geith, \\"Jacques de Varagine, auteur ind√©pendant ou compilateur?\\" in Brenda Dunn-Lardeau, ed. Legenda aurea ‚Äì 'La L√©gende dor√©e 1993:17‚Äì32) who printed the comparable texts side by side. More than 130 more distant sources have been identified for the tales related of the saints in the Golden Legend, few of which have a nucleus in the New Testament itself; these hagiographic sources include apocryphal texts such as the Gospel of Nicodemus, and the histories of Gregory of Tours and John Cassian. Many of his stories have no other known source. A typical example of the sort of story related, also involving St. Silvester, shows the saint receiving miraculous instruction from Saint Peter in a vision that enables him to exorcise a dragon: > In this time it happed that there was at Rome a dragon in a pit, which every > day slew with his breath more than three hundred men. Then came the bishops > of the idols unto the emperor and said unto him: O thou most holy emperor, > sith the time that thou hast received Christian faith the dragon which is in > yonder fosse or pit slayeth every day with his breath more than three > hundred men. Then sent the emperor for S. Silvester and asked counsel of him > of this matter. S. Silvester answered that by the might of God he promised > to make him cease of his hurt and blessure of this people. Then S. Silvester > put himself to prayer, and S. Peter appeared to him and said: \\"Go surely to > the dragon and the two priests that be with thee take in thy company, and > when thou shalt come to him thou shalt say to him in this manner: Our Lord > Jesus Christ which was born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried and arose, > and now sitteth on the right side of the Father, this is he that shall come > to deem and judge the living and the dead, I commend thee Sathanas that thou > abide him in this place till he come. Then thou shalt bind his mouth with a > thread, and seal it with thy seal, wherein is the imprint of the cross.

Jacobus describes the story of Saint Margaret of Antioch surviving being swallowed by a dragon as \\"apocryphal and not to be taken seriously\\" (trans. Ryan, 1.369). Perception and legacy Legenda Aurea, 1499. The book was highly successful in its time, despite many other similar books that compiled legends of the saints. The reason it stood out against competing saint collections probably is that it offered the average reader the perfect balance of information. For example, compared to Jean de Mailly's work Summary of the Deeds and Miracles of the Saints, which The Golden Legend largely borrowed from, Jacobus added chapters about the major feast days and removed some of the saints' chapters, which might have been more useful to the Medieval reader. Many different versions of the text exist, mostly due to copiers and printers adding additional content to it. Each time a new copy was made, it was common for that institution to add a chapter or two about their own local saints. Today more than 1000 original manuscripts have been found, the earliest of which dates back to 1265. =Contemporary influences and translations= The Golden Legend had a big influence on scholarship and literature of the Middle Ages. According to research by Manfred G√∂rlach, it influenced the South English Legendary, which was still being written when Jacobus' text came out. It was also a major source for John Mirk's Festial, Osbern Bokenam's Legends of Hooly Wummen, and the Scottish Legendary. By the end of the Middle Ages, The Golden Legend had been translated into almost every major European language. The earliest surviving English translation is from 1438, and is cryptically signed by \\"a synfulle wrecche\\". In 1483, the work was re-translated and printed by William Caxton under the name The Golden Legende, and subsequently reprinted many times due to the demand. =16th- century rejection and 20th-century revival= The adverse reaction to Legenda aurea under critical scrutiny in the 16th century was led by scholars who reexamined the criteria for judging hagiographic sources and found Legenda aurea wanting; prominent among the humanists were two disciples of Erasmus, Georg Witzel, in the preface to his Hagiologium, and Juan Luis Vives in De disciplinis. Criticism among members of Jacobus' Dominican order were muted by the increased reverence towards the archbishop, which culminated in his beatification in 1815. The rehabilitation of Legenda aurea in the 20th century, now interpreted as a mirror of the heartfelt pieties of the 13th century, is attributed to T√©odor de Wyzewa, whose retranslation into French, and its preface, have been often reprinted. =Editions and translations = Saints Primus and Felician, from a 14th-century manuscript of the Golden Legend The critical edition of the Latin text has been edited by Giovanni Paolo Maggioni (Florence: SISMEL 1998). In 1900, the Caxton version was updated into more modern English by Frederick Startridge Ellis, and published in seven volumes. Jacobus da Varagine's original was translated into French around the same time by T√©odor de Wyzewa. A modern English translation of the Golden Legend has been published by William Granger Ryan, and (2 volumes).

It continues to be one of the leading radical voices in the anti-war movement. Many of the organization's founders had been jailed during World War I for refusing military service. From the Fellowship of Reconciliation many Jews, suffragists, socialists, and anarchists separated to form this more secular organization. Although the WRL was opposed to US participation in World War II, it did not protest against it; the WRL complied with the Espionage Act, ceased public protests, and did not solicit new members during this period.Bennett, p. 74. During World War II, many members were imprisoned as conscientious objectors.Bennett, p. 69ff In the 1950s, WRL members worked in the civil rights movement and organized protests against nuclear weapons testing and civil defense drills. In the 1960s, WRL was the first pacifist organization to call for an end to the Vietnam War. WRL also organized the first demonstration against the war with a September 21, 1963 vigil at the U.S. Mission to the UN, followed by an October 9, 1963 picket of Madame Ngo Dinh Nhu speaking at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City.WRL News, Nov-Dec 1963, p. 1 WRL was among the primary groups (along with Committee for Nonviolent Action, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Socialist Party, and the Student Peace Union) to organize coordinated nationwide protests against the Vietnam War on December 19, 1964.The Power of the People, ed. Robert Cooney & Helen Michalowski, New Society Publishers, Philadelphia, PA, 1987, p. 182 The organization's opposition to nuclear weapons was extended to include nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s. The WRL has also been active in feminist and anti-racist causes and works with other organizations to reduce the level of violence in modern culture. Current activities Presently, the War Resisters League is actively organizing against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as the impact of war at home. Much of its organizing is focused on challenging military recruiters and ending corporate profit from war. It publishes an annual peace calendar, the quarterly magazine WIN: Through Revolutionary Nonviolence, and other materials and is involved in a number of national peace and justice coalitions, including United for Peace and Justice and the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee. Since 1958, WRL has awarded almost annually the War Resisters League Peace Award to a person or organization whose work represents the League's radical nonviolent program of action. The War Resisters League annually publishes a pie chart showing how much of the U.S. federal budget actually covers current and past military expenses, listing the total as 54%: :\\"The figures are federal funds, which do not include trust funds ‚Äî such as Social Security ‚Äî that are raised and spent separately from income taxes....The government practice of combining trust and federal funds began during the Vietnam War, thus making the human needs portion of the budget seem larger and the military portion smaller. \\"Pie chart, warresisters.org.

Music listened to by Tanzanians today stretches from traditional African music or the string-based taarab to a distinctive hip hop known as bongo flava. National anthem The Tanzanian national anthem is Mungu Ibariki Africa (God Bless Africa), composed by South African composer Enoch Sontonga in 1897.Enoch Mankayti Sontonga, SAHistory.org.za, accessdate 2020-1-22 The tune is the ANC's official song and later became the national anthem of South Africa. The melody is also the national anthem of Zambia. In Tanzania, Swahili lyrics were written for this anthem. - Another patriotic song, going back to colonial times, is Tanzania, Tanzania. Gospel music/choral music Modern Gospel, in Swahili Muziki wa Injili, musicians include: * Christina Shusho ‚Äì Gospel singer * Jeniffer Mgend ‚Äì Gospel singer * Mr. Elliot Andy ‚Äì Choral music, university * Dionys Mbilinyi ‚Äì Choral music, church organist * John Mgandu ‚Äì Choral music, church organist * Sabinus Komba ‚Äì Choral music * Imani Sanga ‚Äì Choral music, church organist Bongo Flava/pop music Bongo Flava is one of the newer Tanzanian genres, developed in the 1990s, and is a fusion genre. At its inception, Bongo flava was more heavily influenced by US Hip-Hop and Reggae, fused with traditional Tanzanian music styles. Today however, the sound has somewhat changed, oscillating from its central point -music sung in Swahili- to include a variety of music cultures and styles, and can be described as a fusion of Afrobeats, R&B;, Reggaeton and Taraab. Its name denotes the Swahilisation of global music forms by incorporating Tanzanian musical and linguistic elements. By adding the 'Flava' (= flavour) of Bongo, the name was born. The current trend among Tanzanian music consumers has started changing from international popular music towards favouring products from their local artists who sing in Swahili, the national language. Popular artists include Bill Nass, Vanessa Mdee, Diamond Platnumz, Harmonize, Mbosso, DLOVE, Alikiba, Navy Kenzo, Lava Lava, Dully Sykes, Rayvanny, P-Funk Majani, Whozu, Marioo, Darassa, Nandy. Some of the best known producers include S2Kizzy, Abbah, Lizer classic, Bonga, Kimambo, Blaq and Nahreel. Traditional music The more than 100 ethnic groups of Tanzania have developed a large number of specific traditional musical and dance styles with corresponding instruments. The Zaramo people, for instance, perform traditional dance, such as \\"Mitamba Yalagala Kumchuzi\\" on tuned goblet drums, tuned cylindrical drums, and tin rattles. The multi- instrumentalist Hukwe Zawose, a member of the Gogo ethnic group, was the 20th century's most prominent exponent of Tanzanian traditional music. He specialized in the ilimba, a large lamellophone similar to the mbira. Saida Karoli is a famous traditionalist Tanzanian female singer and performer, who sings in Haya. Karoli's music is described as natural with mellow vocals and hypnotically rhythmicism. Her songs Ndombolo Ya Solo or Maria Salome were huge hits in Tanzania and the countries around; she was nominated at the 2005 and 2006 Tanzania Music Awards in the Best Folk Album category and for the Best Female Vocalist category. Mtindo A mtindo (pl. mitindo) is simply a rhythm, dance or style identified with a particular band. Sikinde, for example, is associated with Mlimani Park Orchestra, and is derived from the ngoma (musical events held by the Zaramo). Some bands maintain the same mtindo throughout their career, while others change with new personnel or popular preference. Taarab Taarab is a music genre popular in Tanzania and Kenya. It is influenced by the musical traditions of the African Great Lakes, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre's first star, Siti binti Saad. History of dance music The first popular music craze in Tanzania was in the early 1930s, when Cuban Rumba was widespread. Young Tanzanians organized themselves into dance clubs and their bands, like the Dar es Salaam Jazz Band, which was founded in 1932. Local bands at the time used brass and percussion instruments, later adding strings. Bands like Morogoro Jazz and Tabora Jazz were formed (despite the name, these bands did not play American style jazz). Competitions were commonplace, a legacy of native ngoma societies and colonial beni brass bands. Tanzania was influenced heavily after the 1960s with the influence of African and Latin music. Tanzanian soldiers brought back with them the music of these cultures, as well as Cuban and European music, when returning from World War II. These musical influences fused and brought together the Tanzanian people. Eventually the country and its people created its own style of music. This style, called \\"Swahili Jazz\\" is a mix of beats and styles of Cuban, European, Latin and African music. Swahili jazz gave Tanzania a sense of independence and togetherness as a country. Independence came in 1961, however, and three years later the state patronage system was set up, and most of the previous bands fell apart. Musicians were paid regular fees, plus a percentage of the gate income, and worked for a department of the government. The first such band is the Nuta Jazz Band, which worked for the National Union of Tanzania. The 1970s saw the popularization a laid-back sound popularized by Orchestre Safari Sound and Orchestre Maquis Original. These groups adopted the motto \\"Kamanyola bila jasho\\" (dance Kamanyola without sweating). Maquis hailed from Lubumbashi in southeastern Zaire, moving to Dar es Salaam in the early 70s. This was a common move at the time, bringing elements of soukous from the Congo basin. Kasalo Kyanga composed the 1985 hit \\"Karubandika\\", which was a popular dance song. Popular bands in the 60s, 70s and 80s included Vijana Jazz, who were the first to add electronic instruments to dansi (in 1987) and DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra, led by Michael Enoch. Rivalries between the bands sometimes led to chaos in the scene, as when Hugo Kisima lured musicians from Mlimani Park and disbanded the wildly popular Orchestra Safari Sound in 1985, forming the International Orchestra Safari Sound. International Orchestra Safari Sound was briefly popular, but the Orchestra Safari Sound was revitalized by Nguza Viking (formerly of maquis), who became bandleader in 1991; this new group lasted only a year. The most recent permutation of Tanzanian dance music is mchiriku. Bands like Gari Kubwa, Tokyo Ngma and Atomic Advantage are among the pioneers of this style, which uses four drums and a keyboard for a sparse sound. Loudness is very important to the style, which is usually blared from out-dated speakers; the resulting feedback is part of the music. The origin of the style is Zaramo wedding music. Hip hop After Tanzania gained its independence, the leaders of the country failed in their mission to produce a successful economy. Structural Adjustment Programs were put into place, which mimicked the same colonial practices that the country attempted to free itself from. Tanzanian youths turned to crime to survive. \\"It is not surprising that most Tanzanians viewed these conditions, especially the rise in crime, and the almost simultaneous rise or rap music, as a single phenomenon. The political establishment and older generation did not accept rap music or uhuni music- since it became synonymous with disruption and anti-social behavior. Yet for the younger generation, traditional Swahili music did not address contradictions of the ‚Äòliberalized‚Äô Tanzanian economy.\\"Lemelle, Sidney J. \\"‚ÄòNi wapi Tunakwenda‚Äô: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha.\\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Pres In 1991, Tanzania hosted a hip hop competition called \\"Yo Rap Bonanza.\\" While most rappers were performing American songs word for word; Saleh Ajabry, a Tanzanian, wrote his own Swahili lyrics to a song based on Vanilla Ice‚Äôs \\"Ice Ice Baby,\\" and won the competition.AFRICAN HIP HOP IN TANZANIA ‚Äì Highlights of a Conversation with Alex Perullo , 2005. Dar es Salaam's Kwanza Unit is the first Tanzanian hip hop crew, but technical limitations hindered commercial success. Mr. II and Juma Nature are the most famous Tanzanian rappers; Mr II's (then known as 2-Proud) \\"Ni Mimi\\" (1995) is the first major hit for the field. Groups like X Plastaz have moved away from American-style hip hop and incorporated Maasai vocal styles and other Tanzanian musics. Tanzanian hip hop is often called as Bongo Flava. Global popular culture, particularly U.S. hip hop, has played a major role in influencing Tanzanian culture since its independence. This is most evident among Tanzanian urban youth, who have absorbed global hip hop music and produced their own varieties. With the increased mediatization of Tanzania in the 1990s, Tanzanian urban youth have had more access to hip hop music, and the incorporation of global culture has become more prevalent and visible in urban Tanzania, not only in the music, but also in fashion, food, dance, and sports.Remes, Pieter. \\"Global Popular Musics and Changing Awareness of Urban Tanzanian Youth.\\" Yearbook for Traditional Music. Vol. 31 (1999), pp. 1‚Äì26. Hip hop has essentially provided Tanzanian urban youth and young adults with a means of expressing themselves and forming an identity, such as the conceptual identity of msafiri (the traveler), a classic subject borrowed from Swahili lore, and a recurrent theme in Dar hip hop.Lemelle, Sidney J. \\"‚ÄòNi wapi Tunakwenda‚Äô: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha.\\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 230-54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press. While Tanzania hip hop is influenced by American hip hop it is also distinctly localized. Whereas American Hip Hop is the product of black urban youth and heavily influenced by race, Tanzania bongo flava took root in the slightly better off part of the city with those that more access to the Western world. Furthermore, Tanzania hip hop artist saw themselves as distinct from American artists in that they focus more on economic issues and less on violence\\"\\" Rapper Sam Stigilydaa put it poignantly when he said, \\"American rappers talk about crazy things-drinking, drugs, violence against women, American blacks killing blacks. I hope African doesn't turn crazy\\"James Astil, \\"Tanzanian rap breaks free of past,' Guardian (London), 3 February 2001, P.18 Because of the massive hip hop artist and fan base in Northern Tanzania's Arusha city, today this is termed as East Africa's Hip hop capital. Artists such as spark Dog Malik, JCB, Watengwa, Chindo aka Umbwax, Donii, Wadudu wa dampo, Jambo Squad, Nako-to-nako, Weusi, Nahreel and many others who are heading Tanzania's hip-hop music are from this City. Reggae Mbaraka Mwinshehe is the most popular and original musician of Tanzania, also there is a greater influx of musicians from the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), who were entering the country as refugees and made residence in the country. But in recent years, mainly from the mid-nineties, new generation of musicians has emerged and are coming up with popular tunes which are Tanzanian in composition. Bands like Twanga Pepeta have managed to carve a new tune distinct from imported Zairean tunes, and are competing with Zairean bands in popularity and audience acceptance. Jah Kimbuteh is the first major reggae star in Tanzania, beginning his career with Roots and Kulture in 1985. Newer artists in the field include the Jam Brothers and Ras Innocent Nyanyagwa, who includes songs in Hehe and Swahili and uses indigenous rhythms. At present, Ras Nas is considered as one of the most known reggae musician from Tanzania. Ras Nas combines reggae, afro and dub poetry. His latest release \\"Dar-es- Salaam\\" contains eight tracks. Many musicians work in bands that play at a hotel, usually led by a keyboard and including a rock-based sound. The Kilimanjaro Connection is perhaps the most respected of these hotel bands, along with Bantu Group and Tanzanites. Distribution and access to music The mushrooming of FM music stations and reasonable production studios has been a major boost to the music industry in the country. Contemporary artists like Diamond Platnumz, Juma Nature, Lady Jaydee, Mr. Nice, Mr. II, Cool James, Dully Sykes, Professor Jay and many others command a huge audience of followers in the country and neighbouring countries. More information about Tanzanian music and events can be found on the various web portals that have sprung up recently. Tanzania has an enormously high growth rate for internet technologies, estimated at up to 500% per year. Because costs for computers are still quite high, many users share connections at internet cafes or at work.naomba.com business directory, tanzaniadirectory.info Movie and Sports information, and Arusha locality information all are part of an increasing number of websites dedicated to the region. Digital Tanzania music downloads are mostly done by free download websites and musicplatforms like iTunes, Google Music etc. Freddie Mercury Freddie Mercury, singer born in Tanzania Freddie Mercury, born Farouk Bulsara into the Indian Parsi community of Stone Town, Zanzibar, later moved to England and rose to worldwide fame as the lead singer, and a songwriter and instrumentalist, of the rock music group Queen. He died on 24 November 1991. Efforts to honour his life and work on the 60th anniversary of his birth were abandoned in September 2006 following the protests of a radical Islamic group on the archipelago, Uamsho, who said he had violated Islam with his openly gay lifestyle. Mercury and the Bulsara family were Parsis from India‚Äîfollowers of Zoroastrianism, not Muslims. The Mercury House, a former home of the Bulsara family, opened as a souvenir store in Stone Town, Zanzibar, in 2002. It opened as a museum to Freddie Mercury on 24 November 2019.

The first Immorality Act, of 1927, prohibited sex between whites and blacks, until amended in 1950 to prohibit sex between whites and all non-whites. The second Immorality Act, of 1957, continued this prohibition and also dealt with many other sex offences. The ban on interracial sex was lifted in 1985, but certain sections of the 1957 act dealing with prostitution remain in force as the \\"Sexual Offences Act, 1957\\". The 1927 act The Immorality Act, 1927 (Act No. 5 of 1927) sexual intercourse outside of marriage between \\"Europeans\\" (white people) and \\"natives\\" (black people). The penalty was up to five years' imprisonment for the man and four years' imprisonment for the woman. where races were decided upon by government officials, not pre-determined by the true ethnicity of the accused). The act also prohibited \\"procuring\\" women for interracial intercourse, and contained a proposal that described a punishment of up to six years of imprisonment specifically for coloured women who were thought to be provoking white males to have intercourse with them. The Immorality Amendment Act, 1950 (Act No. 21 of 1950) amended the 1927 act to forbid unmarried sexual intercourse between \\"Europeans\\" and anyone not \\"European\\". The prohibition was therefore extended to intercourse between white people and coloured or Asian people. Interracial marriages had been banned in 1949 by the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. Later legislation closely related to the Immorality Act also banned the marriage of interracial couples outside of South Africa, viewing foreign marriages as invalid and illegal. The 1957 act The Immorality Act, 1957 (Act No. 23 of 1957; subsequently renamed the Sexual Offences Act, 1957) repealed the 1927 and 1950 acts and replaced them with a clause prohibiting sexual intercourse or \\"immoral or indecent acts\\" between white people and anyone not white. It increased the penalty to up to seven years' imprisonment for both partners. The 1957 act also prohibited brothel- keeping, procuring, and living off the proceeds of prostitution; and it prohibited sexual intercourse with people under the age of sixteen. The Immorality Amendment Act, 1969 (Act No. 57 of 1969) amended the 1957 act to introduce or expand a number of offences. It prohibited the manufacturing or sale of any \\"article intended to be used to perform an unnatural sexual act\\" (i.e. sex toys). Despite the fact that sex between men was already prohibited under the common law crime of sodomy, the 1969 act made it a statutory crime for a man to have sex with another male under the age of nineteen. It also introduced section 20A, the infamous \\"three men at a party\\" clause, which prohibited any sexual activity between men at a party, where \\"party\\" was defined as any occasion where more than two people were present. The Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985 (Act No. 72 of 1985) repealed the provisions of the 1957 act that prohibited interracial sex, and repealed the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. This came as part of the repeal of many petty apartheid laws under the government of P. W. Botha. This act specifically deleted the definitions of \\"coloured\\" and \\"white\\" within the act, and repealed Section 16 of the 1957 act which barred interracial, extramarital sex.Wikisource:Immorality and Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Amendment Act, 1985 The Immorality Amendment Act, 1988 (Act No. 2 of 1988) renamed the Immorality Act, 1957 to the Sexual Offences Act, 1957. It criminalised, for the first time, a woman having sex with a person under the age of consent, for that purpose setting the age of consent at 16 for a boy and 19 for a girl. It also made it a crime to be a prostitute, where previously only certain acts related to prostitution (brothel-keeping, procuring, etc.) had been illegal. The legislation also noted that either gender could now be convicted of sexual offences. Repeal The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007 repealed most of the remaining provisions of the 1957 act. The only provisions still in force are those related to prostitution. The men-at-a-party offence (section 20A) was invalidated in 1998 by the Constitutional Court in the case of National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice. The increased age of consent of nineteen for same-sex sexual activity (as opposed to sixteen for opposite-sex sexual activity) was invalidated in 2008 in the case of Geldenhuys v National Director of Public Prosecutions, although by that time the discriminatory provisions had been repealed by the 2007 amendment act.

They gained wider recognition in 1982 by publishing the Hernandez brothers' Love and Rockets, and moved on to such critically acclaimed and award-winning series as Acme Novelty Library, Eightball, and Hate. The company moved operations to Greater Los Angeles in 1984. Catron acted as Fantagraphics' co-publisher until 1985 (also handling advertising and circulation for The Comics Journal from 1982‚Äì1985), when he left the company.Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999. = The Kirby Award and the Harvey Award = From 1985 to 1987, Fantagraphics coordinated and presented (through their magazine Amazing Heroes) The Jack Kirby Award for achievement in comic books, voted on by comic-book professionals. The Kirby Award was managed by Dave Olbrich, a Fantagraphics employee (and later publisher of Malibu Comics). In 1987, a dispute arose when Olbrich and Fantagraphics each claimed ownership of the awards. A compromise was reached, and starting in 1988, the Kirby Award was discontinued and two new awards were created:\\"Newswatch: Kirby Awards End In Controversy,\\" The Comics Journal #122 (June 1988), pp. 19‚Äì20. the Eisner Award, managed by Olbrich; and the Fantagraphics-managed Harvey Award, named for cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman. Since their inception, the Harvey Awards have been presented at various comic book conventions, such as the Chicago Comicon, the Dallas Fantasy Fair, WonderCon, the Pittsburgh Comicon, the MoCCA Festival, Baltimore Comic-Con and their current venue, the New York Comic Con. The Harvey Awards are no longer affiliated with Fantagraphics. = Relocation to Seattle = In 1989, Fantagraphics relocated from Los Angeles to its current location in the Maple Leaf neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. In 1990, the publisher introduced Eros Comix, a lucrative line of erotic comics which again saved the company from bankruptcy. Longtime employee Eric Reynolds joined Fantagraphics in 1993, first as news editor for The Comics Journal from 1993, before moving to marketing and promotion in 1996. Tom Spurgeon, later known as the publisher of The Comics Reporter, was editor of The Comics Journal from 1994 to 1999. = Financial ups and downs = In 1998, Fantagraphics was forced into a round of layoffs; and in 2003 the company almost went out of business, losing over $60,000 in the wake of the 2002 bankruptcy of debtor and book trade distributor Seven Hills Distribution.Dean, Michael. \\"Seven Hills Follows LPC into Limbo, Marvel Abandons Diamond for CDS,\\" The Comics Journal, Posted August 30, 2002. One employee quit during the subsequent downsizing while denouncing Fantagraphic's \\"disorganization and poor management.\\" Fantagraphics was saved by a restructuring and a successful appeal to comic book fandom that resulted in a huge number of orders. After restructuring, the company has had greater success with such hardcover collections as The Complete Peanuts, distributed by W. W. Norton & Company.

The best known modern genre originating in Ghana is Highlife. For many years, Highlife was the preferred music genre until the introduction of Hiplife and many others. Traditional music The traditional musicology of Ghana may be divided geographically between the open and vast savanna country of northern Ghana inhabited by Ghanaians of Gur and Mande speaking groups; and the fertile, forested southern coastal areas, inhabited by Ghanaians speaking Kwa languages such as Akan. *The northern musical traditions belong to the wider Sahelian musical traditions. It features a mix of melodic composition on stringed instruments such as the kologo lute and the gonjey fiddle, wind instruments such as flutes and horns, and voice; with polyrhythms clapped or played on the talking drum, gourd drums or brekete bass drums. The tradition of gyil music (balafon) is also common, especially in northwestern Ghana around Wa and Lawra. Music in the northern styles is mostly set to a minor pentatonic or chromatic scale and melisma plays an important part in melodic and vocal styles. There is a long history of either griot or praise-singing traditions. *The music of the coast is associated with social functions, and relies on complex polyrhythmic patterns played by drums and bells as well as harmonized song. Drums and dance are often linked, and the tradition of royal talking drums fontomfrom (distinct from the northern talking drum) means music is widely used for communication of both tangible and esoteric topics. The most well known of southern Ghanaian drum traditions is the kete and adowa drum and bell ensembles. Music can also be linked to traditional religions. An exception to this rule is the Akan tradition of singing with the Seperewa harp-lute which had its origins in the stringed harps of the north and west. Gold Coast period During the Gold Coast era lexie, the Gold Coast was a hotbed of musical syncretism. Rhythms especially from gombe and ashiko, guitar-styles such as mainline and osibisaba, European brass bands and sea shanties, were all combined into a melting pot that became high-life. Mid-20th century and the invention of Ghanaian pop Ghana became an independent nation in 1957. The music of Ghana often reflects a Caribbean influence, yet it still retains a flavour all its own. While pan-Ghanaian music had been developed for some time, the middle of the 20th century saw the development of distinctly Ghanaian pop music. High-life incorporated elements of swing, jazz, rock, ska and soukous. To a much lesser extent, Ghanaian musicians found success in the United States and, briefly, the United Kingdom with the surprise success of Osibisa's Afro-rock in the 1970s. =Guitar-bands in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s= In the 1930s, Sam's Trio, led by Jacob Sam (Kwame Asare), was the most influential of the high-life guitar-bands. Their \\"Yaa Amponsah\\", three versions of which were recorded in 1928 for Zonophone, was a major hit that remains a popular staple of numerous high-life bands. The next major guitar-band leader was E. K. Nyame, who sang in Twi. Nyame also added the double bass and more elements of the Western hemisphere, including jazz and Cuban music on the recommendation of his producer and manager E. Newman-Adjiri. In the 1960s, dance high-life was more popular than guitar-band high-life; most of the guitar bands began using the electric guitar until a roots revival in the mid-1970s. =Dance high-life in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s= Dance highlife evolved during World War II, when American jazz and swing became popular with the arrival of servicemen from the United States and United Kingdom. After independence in 1957, the socialist government began encouraging folk music, but highlife remained popular and influences from Trinidadian music. E. T. Mensah was the most influential musician of this period, and his band The Tempos frequently accompanied the president. The original bandleader of The Tempos was Guy Warren, who was responsible for introducing Caribbean music to Ghana and, later, was known for a series of innovative fusions of African rhythms and American jazz. Ebo Taylor, King Bruce, Jerry Hansen (musician) and Stan Plange also led influential dance bands during the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, however, pop music from Europe and the US dominated the Ghanaian scene until a mid-1970s roots revival. =1970s: Head revival= By the beginning of the 1970s, traditionally styled highlife had been overtaken by electric guitar bands and pop-dance music. Since 1966 and the fall of President Kwame Nkrumah, many Ghanaian musicians moved abroad, settling in the US, and UK. High-life bands arose like Sammy Kofi's (also known as Kofi Sammy). In 1971, the Soul to Soul music festival was held in Accra. Several legendary American musicians played, including Wilson Pickett, Ike and Tina Turner and Carlos Santana. With the exception of Mexican-American Santana, these American superstars were all black, and their presence in Accra was seen as legitimizing Ghanaian music. Though the concert is now mostly remembered for its role as a catalyst in the subsequent Ghanaian roots revival, it also led to increased popularity for American rock and soul. Inspired by the American musicians, new guitar bands arose in Ghana, including Nana Ampadu& the African Brothers, The City Boys and others. Musicians such as C. K. Mann, Daniel Amponsah and Eddie Donkor incorporated new elements, especially from Jamaican reggae. A group called Wulomei also arose in the 1970s, leading a cultural revival to encourage Ghanaian youths to support their own countryman's music. By the 1980s, the UK was experiencing a boom in African music as Ghanaian and others moved there in large numbers. The group Hi-Life International was probably the most influential band of the period, and others included Jon K, Dade Krama, Orchestra Jazira and Ben Brako. In the middle of the decade, however, British immigration laws changed, and the focus of Ghanaian emigration moved to Germany. The Ghanaian-German community created a form of highlife called Burger-highlife. The most influential early burgher highlife musician was George Darko, whose \\"Akoo Te Brofo\\" coined the term and is considered the beginning of the genre. Burgher highlife was extremely popular in Ghana, especially after computer-generated dance beats were added to the mix. The same period saw a Ghanaian community appear in Toronto and elsewhere in Canada. Pat Thomas is probably the most famous Ghanaian-Canadian musician. Other emigres include Ghanaian-American Obo Addy, the Ghanaian-Swiss Andy Vans and the Ghanaian-Dutch Kumbi Salleh. In Ghana itself during the 1980s, reggae became extremely popular. =Hip-life= By the late 1990s, a new generation of artists discovered the so-called Hiplife. The originator of this style is Reggie Rockstone, a Ghanaian musician who dabbled with hip-hop in the United States before finding his unique style. Hiplife basically was hiphop in the Ghanaian local dialect backed by elements of the traditional High-life. Ace music producer Hammer of The Last Two unveiled artistes including Obrafour, Tinny and Ex-doe who further popularized the Hiplife music genre respectively. Hiplife has since proliferated and spawned stars such as Reggie Rockstone, Sherifa Gunu, Ayigbe Edem, Samini and Sarkodie. Producers responsible for steering this genre to what it is today were Hammer of The Last Two, Ball J, EL and Jupitar Dancehall Artiste. Hip hop Ghanaian hip hop is a subculture and art movement which developed in Ghana during the late 1990s. The hiphop genre came into existence in Ghana through Reggie Rockstone, who is known as the hiplife father and other notable musicians such as Jayso and Ball J .It first came to Ghana as Hiplife where Reggie Rockstone introduced a fusion of hiphop beats with African sounds to create a whole new genre known as Gh hiphop.

It behaves as a fast-acting neurotoxin in insects. It is easily degraded on soil and plants but can be effective for weeks when applied to indoor inert surfaces. Exposure to sunlight, water and oxygen will accelerate its decomposition. Cypermethrin is highly toxic to fish, bees and aquatic insects, according to the National Pesticides Telecommunications Network (NPTN). It is found in many household ant and cockroach killers, including Raid, Ortho, Combat, and ant chalk. Uses Cypermethrin is used in agriculture to control ectoparasites which infest cattle, sheep, and poultry. Human exposure Cypermethrin is moderately toxic through skin contact or ingestion. It may cause irritation to the skin and eyes. Symptoms of dermal exposure include numbness, tingling, itching, burning sensation, loss of bladder control, incoordination, seizures and possible death. Pyrethroids may adversely affect the central nervous system. Human volunteers given dermal doses of 130Œºg/cm on the earlobe experienced local tingling and burning sensations. One man died after eating a meal cooked in a 10% cypermethrin/oil mix that was mistakenly used for cooking oil. Shortly after the meal, the victim experienced nausea, prolonged vomiting, stomach pains, and diarrhea which progressed to convulsions, unconsciousness and coma. Other family members exhibited milder symptoms and survived after hospital treatment. It may cause allergic skin reactions in humans. Excessive exposure can cause nausea, headache, muscle weakness, salivation, shortness of breath and seizures. In humans, cypermethrin is deactivated by enzymatic hydrolysis to several carboxylic acid metabolites, which are eliminated in the urine. Worker exposure to the chemical can be monitored by measurement of the urinary metabolites, while severe overdosage may be confirmed by quantitation of cypermethrin in blood or plasma.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 389-391. Study in animals Cypermethrin is very toxic to cats which cannot tolerate the therapeutic doses for dogs. This is associated with UGT1A6 deficiency in cats, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing cypermethrin. As a consequence, cypermethrin remains much longer in the cat's organs than in dogs or other mammals and can be fatal in large doses. In male rats cypermethrin was shown to exhibit a toxic effect on the reproductive system. After 15 days of continual dosing, both androgen receptor levels and serum testosterone levels were significantly reduced. These data suggested that cypermethrin can induce impairments of the structure of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis in male rats at high doses. Long-term exposure to cypermethrin during adulthood is found to induce dopaminergic neurodegeneration in rats, and postnatal exposure enhances the susceptibility of animals to dopaminergic neurodegeneration if rechallenged during adulthood. If exposed to cypermethrin during pregnancy, rats give birth to offspring with developmental delays. In male rats exposed to cypermethrin, the proportion of abnormal sperm increases. It causes genetic damage: chromosomal abnormalities increased in bone marrow and spleen cells when mice were exposed to cypermethrin. Cypermethrin is classified as a possible human carcinogen, because it causes an increase in the frequency of lung tumors in female mice. Cypermethrin has been linked to an increase in bone marrow micronuclei in both mice and humans. One study showed that cypermethrin inhibits ‚Äúgap junctional intercellular communication‚Äù, which plays an important role in cell growth and is inhibited by carcinogenic agents. Studies have shown that residue from cypermethrin can last for 84 days in the air, on walls, the floor and on furniture. Environmental effects Cypermethrin is a broad-spectrum insecticide, which means it kills beneficial insects as well as the targeted insects. Fish are particularly susceptible to cypermethrin, but when used as directed, application around residential sites poses little risk to aquatic life. Resistance to cypermethrin has developed quickly in insects exposed frequently and can render it ineffective.

Early life Born in Buffalo, New York, United States, Henderson moved to New York City and became a popular composer in Tin Pan Alley. He was one third of a successful songwriting and music publishing team with Lew Brown and Buddy De Sylva from 1925 through 1930, responsible for several editions of the revue called George White's Scandals and such book musicals as Good News, Hold Everything!, and Follow Thru. After De Sylva's departure, Henderson continued to write with Brown through 1933. Then, he worked with other partners. In 1934, he composed the musical Say When with lyricist Ted Koehler. Music Henderson's biggest hit songs included \\"Annabelle\\" (1923), \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\", \\"Has Anybody Seen My Girl?\\" (a/k/a \\"Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue\\"), \\"I'm Sitting on Top of the World\\", \\"Don't Bring Lulu\\" (all 1925), \\"The Birth of the Blues\\" (1926), \\"The Varsity Drag\\", \\"The Best Things in Life Are Free\\" (both 1927), \\"You're The Cream In My Coffee\\", \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\" (both 1928), \\"You Are My Lucky Star\\", \\"I'm a Dreamer, Aren't We All\\", \\"(Keep Your) Sunny Side Up\\" (all 1929), \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\", \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\" (both 1931), and \\"Animal Crackers in My Soup\\" (1935). Career Henderson also worked as an accompanist to song and dance acts in Vaudeville. His last Broadway show was a resuscitation of the Ziegfeld Follies, one of several put on after Ziegfeld's death. Henderson's, in 1943, had the longest run of any Follies at 553 performances. He effectively retired from composing in the late 1940s, and worked on an opera which was never completed. Death Henderson died of a heart attack in Greenwich, Connecticut in December 1970, at the age of 74. In popular culture Good News has been adapted for film twice; in 1930 and in 1947. The 1956 film The Best Things in Life Are Free was a dramatization of the songwriting team of Henderson, Brown and De Sylva; Henderson was played by Dan Dailey. The film included many of the trio's songs. In 2000, a revue of Henderson's music called It's the Cherries opened in New York City as the inaugural show of the American Composer Series.

In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally. Biochemistry and effects A wide variety of alkaloid and non- alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of ephedra. Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in ephedra (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat. Ephedra is widely used by athletes as a performance- enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. Ephedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements. Adverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.

Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand. Regulation in the United States Escalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld. =Initial concerns and industry response= In 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.\\"Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids; Proposed Rule\\" , from the Federal Register, June 4, 1997.

This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long- term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects. Almost simultaneously, a study in Annals of Internal Medicine found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or Ginkgo biloba. On December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements.\\"FDA Announces Plans to Prohibit Sales of Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedra\\": Press release from the FDA website, issued December 30, 2003, accessed 7 February 2007. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid- containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that \\"...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.\\" Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day. =Legal challenges= Nutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.\\"Judge's Decision Lifts Ban On Sale of Ephedra in Utah\\", from The New York Times, published April 15, 2005. Accessed 7 February 2007. The ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition.

Connections to Soma Rituals  = History of Soma = It was only two hundred and fifty years ago when western scholars first encountered the Vedas, but these ancient religious texts had been written down around 1500 B.C. and likely existed orally long before that.Mahdihassan, S. ‚ÄúEphedra, the oldest medicinal plant with the history of an uninterrupted use.‚Äù Ancient science of life vol. 7,2 (1987): 105-9. Throughout the many hymns, prayers, and philosophy found in its pages, a mysterious plant is mentioned often and with great reverence. This plant alternates from a holy substance to an actual personified god and is considered a teacher, doctor, medicine, a bringer of insight and a vector of inspiration.Houben, Jan. ‚ÄúThe Soma-Haoma problem : Introductory overview and observations on the discussion.‚Äù Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies, 2003. The deity version of Soma was associated with medicinal herbs and the moon and was considered a bringer of health and prosperity.Cartwright, Mark. \\"Soma.\\" Ancient History Encyclopedia. Ancient History Encyclopedia, 30 Jan 2016. Web. 17 Apr 2020. The plant was an essential aspect of Vedic religion to alter one‚Äôs mind, enabling communion with the divine. The ritual drinking of Soma was also found in the ancient Zoroastrian text, the Avesta. The rituals and importance of the plant were very similar to those in Vedic culture but were instead called by the name haoma. It is unknown why, but eventually in both the Vedic and Zoroastrian cultures a substitute substance was used in these religious ceremonies and over time the definitive identity of Soma-Haoma has been lost. There is much debate over which species is the sacred plant but the most evidence and support from experts in the field show that the identity of Soma was a species of Ephedra. = Ritual Use of Ephedra = In Hinduism, the Vedic texts show Soma as being not only a plant but also a drink and a deity. The Rigveda is one of the four oldest and most sacred collections of stories in Hinduism. In the Rigveda soma is a drink consumed by two of the main gods; Agni and Indra. In the texts the drink helped the gods in battle by strengthening them physically.Shah, N.C. ‚ÄúSoma, an Enigmatic, Mysterious Plant of the Vedic Aryas: An Appraisal‚Äù Indian Journal of History of Science, vol. 50.1, (2015): 26-4 Because of this, soma was given and consumed by warriors before wartime or a battle. The drink was supposed to give the warriors strength and luck in the upcoming conflict. Immortality is also a quality associated with soma due to it being a drink of the divine. At religious ceremonies the drink was consumed to give consumers longevity in life. At birth the drink was also given to the babies for these same reasons. In Zoroastrianism the drink is called haoma and has similar uses. Just like in Hinduism, the drink was related to immortality and long life. Haoma was the first thing newborns drank. This assured the child would be healthy and live a long life. The drink was also administered to people close to death to resurrect them back into good health. = Evidence of Ephedra as the identity of Soma = Out of the possible identities of Soma one of the main theories is that it is a plant from the Ephedra genus, more specifically Ephedra sinica. Soma and haoma are considered by most to be very similar if not the same drink just with different names due to their differences in religious backgrounds. Both in modern Zoroastrianism and past scriptures the main ingredient of haoma has been plants of the Ephedra genus. This suggests that its close counterpart soma is also made from the Ephedra plants. Another reason Ephedra sinica is believed to be the main ingredient in the original soma drink is because of its effects on the body. The genus of plants contains the phytochemical ephedrine. The stimulant increases heart rate as well as blood pressure. It dilates the user's pupils and also relaxes non-essential muscles.Brough, John. ‚ÄúSoma and Amanita muscaria.‚Äù Cambridge University Press, https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/612695.pdf The drink was given to men before battle and was said to increase their strength and effectiveness on the battlefield. All of these effects of ephedrine would suggest why warriors would feel stronger or more effective on the battlefield. Ephedra would make sense as the ingredient in soma due to its stimulant qualities. Just like someone today who uses the ephedrine for blood pressure or asthma medication, someone back then who consumed the plant would feel strengthened by it. The effects of soma in the texts are described as that of a stimulant. An example of this is causing people to stay awake throughout the nighttime. In no way are the effects described as a depressant or hallucinogen. This points to ephedra as being a strong candidate for soma. The physical appearance of Ephedra is also a reason it is believed to be the soma plant. According to the Vedic text Rigveda, the plant composing soma is shaped like an arrow. Ephedra sinica is a gymnosperm that forms stalks with buds on the end. It is easy to see how this shape could be described like an arrow. Another text refers to soma as a twig, which is much like Ephedra sinica when it is dried out.

Brown was one third of a successful songwriting and music publishing team with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson from 1925 until 1931. Brown also wrote or co-wrote many Broadway shows and Hollywood films. Among his most-popular songs are \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\", \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\", \\"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\\", \\"That Old Feeling\\", and \\"The Birth of the Blues\\". Early life and family Brown was born December 10, 1893, in Odessa, Russian Empire, part of today's Ukraine, the son of Etta (Hirsch) and Jacob Brownstein. His family was Jewish. When he was five, his family immigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. He attended DeWitt Clinton High School but, at the suggestion of a teacher, he left to pursue his songwriting career without graduating. Lew Brown was married first to Sylvia Fiske, then to Catherine \\"June\\" Brown until his death. He had two daughters from his first marriage, Naomi Brown Greif and Arlyne Brown Mulligan. The latter was married to the prominent jazz saxophonist Gerry Mulligan. Career Brown started writing for Tin Pan Alley in 1912 and collaborated with established composers, like Albert Von Tilzer. Two of their well-known works that year were \\"(I'm Going Back to) Kentucky Sue\\" and \\"I'm the Lonesomest Gal in Town\\". Brown then wrote a string of popular World War I songs during 1914‚Äì1918, teaming with Von Tilzer, Al Harriman, and other composers. In 1925, Brown formed his most-successful songwriting partnership with Buddy DeSylva and Ray Henderson. Their cheerful hits, such as \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\" and \\"The Birth of the Blues\\", earned lasting appreciation for \\"the rich variety of verbal mosaics\\" and \\"the suggestive imagery that was their trademark\\". DeSylva left in 1931 but Brown and Henderson continued scoring Broadway shows. Brown also worked with other composers, like Sammy Fain. \\"Brown in 1939 estimated that he had written or collaborated on about 7,000 songs.\\" Brown wrote the lyrics to \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" (1942), which appeared in the film Private Buckaroo. Recordings by Glenn Miller and by the Andrews Sisters popularized the song with World War II soldiers and radio audiences. Not long after this hit, Brown retired from songwriting. =Honors and awards= Brown and Fain's \\"That Old Feeling\\" (1937) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Von Tilzer, DeSylva, Brown and Henderson were all included in the inaugural class of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. =Biographical film= The DeSylva, Brown and Henderson songwriting team was the subject of the 1956 musical biopic: The Best Things in Life Are Free.

It is widely regarded as a book that helped establish the genre conventions of steampunk. It posits a Victorian era Britain in which great technological and social change has occurred after entrepreneurial inventor Charles Babbage succeeded in his ambition to build a mechanical computer (actually his Analytical Engine rather than the difference engine). The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 1990, the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991, and both the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Prix Aurora Award in 1992. Setting The novel is chiefly set in 1855. The fictional historical background diverges from our timeline around 1824, at which point Charles Babbage completes his Difference Engine and proceeds to develop an Analytical Engine. He becomes politically powerful and at the 1830 general election successfully opposes the Tory Government of the Duke of Wellington. Although Wellington stages a coup d'√©tat in 1830 in an attempt to overturn his defeat and prevent the acceleration of technological change and social upheaval, he is assassinated in 1831. The Industrial Radical Party, led by a Lord Byron who survives the Greek War of Independence, comes to power. The Tory Party and hereditary peerage are eclipsed, and British trade unions assist in the ascendancy of the Industrial Radical Party (much as they aided the Labour Party of Great Britain in the twentieth century in our own world). As a result, Luddite anti-technological working class revolutionaries are ruthlessly suppressed. By 1855, the Babbage computers have become mass-produced and ubiquitous, and their use emulates the innovations that actually occurred during our information technology and Internet revolutions. Other steam-powered technologies have also developed and so, for example, Gurney steam carriages increasingly common. The novel explores the social consequences of an information technology revolution in the nineteenth century, such as the emergence of \\"clackers\\" (a reference to hackers), technologically-proficient people, such as Th√©ophile Gautier, who are skilled at programming the Engines through the use of punched cards. In the novel, the British Empire is more powerful than in our reality because of the development and the use of extremely-advanced steam-driven technology in industry. In addition, similar military technology has enhanced the capabilities of the armed forces (airships, dreadnoughts, and artillery) and the Babbage computers themselves. Under the Industrial Radical Party, Britain shows the utmost respect for leading scientific and industrial figures such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin. Indeed, they are collectively called \\"savants\\" and often raised to the peerage on their merits, causing a break with the past as regards social prestige and class distinction. The new patterns are also reflected in the educational sphere: classical studies have lost importance to more practical concerns such as engineering and accountancy. Britain, rather than the United States, opened Japan to Western trade, in part because the United States became fragmented by interference from a Britain that foresaw the implications of a unified United States on the world stage. Counterpart successor states to our world's United States include a (truncated) United States; the Confederate States of America; the Republic of Texas; the Republic of California; a Communist Manhattan Island commune (with Karl Marx as a leading light); British North America (analogous to Canada, albeit slightly larger in this world); Russian America (Alaska); and terra nullius. Napoleon III's French Empire holds an entente with the British, and Napoleon is even married to a British woman. In the world of The Difference Engine, France occupies Mexico, as it did briefly in reality during the American Civil War. Like Great Britain, it has its own analytical/difference engines (ordinateurs), especially used in the context of domestic surveillance within its police force and intelligence agencies. As for the other world powers, Germany remains fragmented, with no suggestion that Prussia will eventually form the core of a unified nation, as it did in our own timeline in 1871, which may be caused by French sabotage analogous to that pursued in the case of the fragmentation of the United States noted above. Japan is awakening after the British ended its isolation, and looks, as in our timeline, set to become one of this world's leading industrial and economic powers from the 20th century onward. The intervention of Lords Byron and Babbage provide famine relief with grain confiscated from the landed aristocracy. The Great Famine of Ireland never occurred, there is no agitation for Irish home rule or Irish independence and the Irish instead have become enthusiastic supporters of the Radical regime. A Spanish Civil War is mentioned to be taking place in 1855 with one side being the Royalists, and in 1905, possibly as a result of that conflict, there is an independent Republic of Catalonia Among other historical characters, the novel features \\"Texian\\" President Sam Houston, as an exile after a political coup in Texas, a reference to Percy Bysshe Shelley (as a Luddite), John Keats as a kinotropist (an operator of mechanical pixellated screens), and Benjamin Disraeli as a publicist and tabloid writer. Plot summary The action of the story follows Sybil Gerard, a political courtesan and daughter of an executed Luddite leader; Edward \\"Leviathan\\" Mallory, a paleontologist and explorer; and Laurence Oliphant, a historical figure who, as is portrayed in the book, was a travel writer whose work was a cover for espionage activities \\"undertaken in the service of Her Majesty\\".'\\"Secret Agent\\", Chap. 5, 'Laurence Oliphant, Anne Taylor, Oxford University Press, 1982 Linking all their stories is the trail of a mysterious set of reportedly very powerful computer punch cards and the individuals fighting to obtain them. Many characters come to believe that the punch cards are a gambling \\"modus\\", a programme that would allow the user to place consistently winning bets. The last chapter reveals that the punched cards represent a program that proves two theorems, which, in reality, would not be discovered until 1931 by Kurt G√∂del. Ada Lovelace delivers a lecture on the subject in France. Defending the cards, Mallory gathers his brothers and Ebenezer Fraser, a secret police officer, to fight the revolutionary Captain Swing, who leads a London riot during \\"the Stink\\", a major episode of pollution in which London swelters under an inversion layer (comparable to the London Smog of December 1952). After the abortive uprising, Oliphant and Sybil Gerard meet at a cafe in Paris. Oliphant informs her that he is aware of her true identity but will not pursue it. However, he wants information that would compromise her seducer, Charles Egremont MP, now regarded as an obstacle to the strategies and political ambitions of Lords Brunel and Babbage. Sybil has longed for an opportunity for vengeance against Egremont, and the resultant political scandal destroys his parliamentary career and aspirations for a merit lordship. Oliphant also encounters a Manhattan-based group of feminist pantomime artists. After several vignettes that elaborate on the alternate historical origins of the world of The Difference Engine, Lovelace delivers her lecture on G√∂del's Theorem, as its counterpart is known in our world. She is chaperoned by Fraser and castigated by Sybil Gerard, who is still unable to forgive Ada's father, the late Lord Byron, for his role in her own father's death. At the very end of the novel is a depiction of an alternate 1991 from the vantage point of a computer, which is revealed to be the narrator as it achieves self-awareness. Characters * The character Michael Godwin was named after attorney Mike Godwin to thank for his technical assistance in linking Sterling and Gibson's computers, which allowed them to collaborate between Austin and Vancouver. * The characters of Sybil Gerard; her father, Walter Gerard; Charles Egremont; and Dandy Mick are all borrowed from Benjamin Disrael's novel SybilSybil  Literary criticism and significance  The novel has attracted the attention of scholars, including Jay Clayton, who explores the book's attitude toward hacking, as well as its treatment of Babbage and Ada Lovelace; Herbert Sussman, who demonstrates how the book rewrites Benjamin Disraeli's novel Sybil; and Brian McHale, who relates it to the postmodern interest in finding a \\"new way of 'doing' history in fiction.\\" The novel was nominated for the British Science Fiction Award in 1990, the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991, and both the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Prix Aurora Award in 1992. Influence The 1993 video game The Chaos Engine (released as Soldiers of Fortune in the USA) was based on The Difference Engine.

Also particularly helpful is Review of Culture No. 20 July/September (English Edition) 1994, which is devoted to the ethnography of the Macanese.Marreiros, Carlos (1994), \\"Alliances for the Future\\" in Review of Culture, No. 20 July/September (English Edition), pp. 162‚Äì172. Name The term \\"Êæ≥ÈñÄ‰∫∫\\" (meaning Macanese) and \\"ÂúüÁîüËë°‰∫∫\\" (meaning native-born Portuguese people) in Chinese (Cantonese), the lingua franca of Macau, refers to the Macau people and the Macanese people, respectively. Although there have been attempts by the Portuguese Macau government in the mid-1990s to redefine the Portuguese and English term \\"Macanese\\" as Macau Permanent Resident (anyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or nationality), in accordance with the Chinese (Cantonese) usage, it didn't succeed. Consequently, the Portuguese and English term \\"Macanese\\" refers neither to the indigenous people of Macau (Tanka people) nor to the demonym of Macau, but to a distinctive minority culture (1.2% of all Macau population) that Macau people are proud of. Culture Modern Macanese culture can be best described as a Sino-Latin culture. Historically, many ethnic Macanese spoke Patu√°, which is a Portuguese-based creole and now virtually extinct. Many are fluent in both Portuguese and Cantonese. The Macanese have preserved a distinctive Macanese cuisine.  History  =The Portuguese Colonial Period= The Macanese, Miguel Ant√≥nio de Cortela. Attributed to Lam Qua, early to mid-19th century. Macau was founded circa 1557 by Portuguese merchants with permission of the Chinese Canton governor and later the emperor. Since its beginning, Macau has not been conquered and until the attacks of the Dutch in 1604, it didn¬¥t have a military garrison. Portuguese culture dominates the Macanese, but Chinese cultural patterns are also significant. The community acted as the interface between Portuguese merchant settlers or ruling colonial government ‚Äì Portuguese from Portugal who knew little about Chinese ‚Äì and the Chinese majority (90% of population) who knew equally little about the Portuguese. Some Macanese had paternal Portuguese heritage. Some were Portuguese men stationed in Macau as part of their military service. Many stayed in Macau after the expiration of their military service, marrying Macanese women. Rarely did Chinese women marry Portuguese; initially, mostly Goans, Ceylonese/Sinhalese (from Sri Lanka), Indochina, Malay (from Malacca), and Japanese women were the wives of the Portuguese men in Macau. Slave women of Indian, Indonesian, Malay, and Japanese origin were used as partners by Portuguese men. Japanese girls would be purchased in Japan by Portuguese men. Macau received an influx of African slaves, Japanese slaves as well as Christian Korean slaves who were bought by the Portuguese from the Japanese after they were taken prisoner during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) in the era of Hideyoshi. From 1555 onwards, Macau received slave women of Timorese origin as well as women of African origin, and from Malacca and India. Macau was permitted by Pombal to receive an influx of Timorese women. Many Chinese became Macanese simply by converting to Catholicism, and had no ancestry from the Portuguese, having assimilated into the Macanese people since they were rejected by non-Christian Chinese. The majority of marriages between Portuguese and natives was between Portuguese men and women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors, or low-class Chinese women. Western men like the Portuguese were refused by high class Chinese women, who did not marry foreigners. Literature in Macau was written about love affairs and marriage between the Tanka women and Portuguese men, like \\"A-Chan, A Tancareira\\", by Henrique de Senna Fernandes. More of the stories of Christianized Chinese who adopted Portuguese customs will be narrated on the 3rd paragraph. Furthermore, in the midst of the Manila Galleon trade, a small number of Latinos settled in the ports of Macau in China and Ternate in Indonesia which were secondary connecting trade nodes to the primary trade- route between Manila, Philippines and Acapulco, Mexico; they intermarried with the Portuguese settlers and various Asian settlers; the first Latin Americans Asians were mostly Mexicans and to a lesser extent, Colombians and Peruvians who made their way to Asia (Mainly the Philippines) in the 16th century, the Latin-Americans who were sent to the Philippines and Macau from the Spanish colonies in America were often made up of Mulattoes, Mestizos and Indios (Amerindians).Letter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15 1620.(From the Spanish Archives of the Indies) Following the Shimabara Rebellion in 1638, about 400 Japanese Christians were officially deported to Macau or to the Spanish Philippines, and thousands more were pressured into voluntary exile. Macanese senhora in her traditional attire, the d√≥, early 20th century During the late-nineteenth century, and increasingly during Salazar's fascist Estado Novo regime, the upbringing of most Macanese fell along the lines of the continental Portuguese ‚Äì attending Portuguese schools, participating in mandatory military service (some fought in Africa) and practising the Catholic faith. As recently as the 1980s, most Macanese had not received formal Chinese schooling and, hence, could speak but not read or write Chinese. Spoken Cantonese was largely familiar, and some spoke the language with a regional accent (ÈÑâ‰∏ãË©±) ‚Äì acquired largely from their mothers or amahs.Of interest is the role that the amah plays in Macanese society. It is well known that local Cantonese women were often hired by the Catholic Church in Macau to act as wet-nurses for orphans in the Church's charge. These women were also hired by Macanese families to clean their houses, cook meals and care for their children. It is in these early encounters that Macanese children are first introduced to the Cantonese language and culture. Families are known to keep long-standing friendships with their amahs and in the past, young brides would sometimes bring them along with them to their new home. Nowadays Filipinas fill the role. c.f. Soares, Jos√© Caetano (1950), Macau e a Assist√™ncia (Panorama m√©dico-social), Lisbon, Ag√™ncia Geral das Col√≥nias Divis√£o de Publica√ß√µes e Biblioteca, and Jorge, Edith de (1993), The Wind Amongst the Ruins: A childhood in Macao, New York: Vantage Press. Since Portuguese settlement in Macau ‚Äì dating from 1557 ‚Äì included a strong Catholic presence, a number of Chinese converted to Catholicism. A large number of Macanese can trace their roots to these New Christians. Many of these Chinese were assimilated into the Macanese community, dropping their Chinese surnames and adopting Portuguese surnames. In the collective Macanese folk memory, there is a little ditty about the parish of St. Lazarus Parish, called ÈÄ≤ÊïôÂúç, where these Chinese converts lived: ÈÄ≤ÊïôÂúç, Ââ≤ËæÆ‰ªî, Âîî‰øÇÂßìÂøµÁè† (Ros√°rio) Â∞±‰øÇÂßìÁé´Áë∞ (Rosa). Hence, it is surmised that many Macanese with surnames of Rosario or Rosa probably were of Chinese ancestry. Because of this, there are many Eurasians carrying Portuguese surnames Rosario, Rosa, and others that are not Portuguese-blooded may be mistaken by others as Portuguese-blooded, and Eurasians of Portuguese blood carrying Portuguese surnames trace their Portuguese blood on maternal side. A visit to the St Michael the Archangel Cemetery (Cemit√©rio S√£o Miguel Arcanjo), the main Catholic cemetery near the St. Lazarus Parish, would reveal gravestones with a whole spectrum of Chinese and Portuguese heritage: Chinese with Portuguese baptised names with or without Portuguese surnames, Portuguese married with Chinese Catholics, and so on. The mid-twentieth century, with the outbreak of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the Macanese population surge through the re-integration of two disparate Macanese communities: the Hong Kong Macanese and the Shanghai Macanese. With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the Macanese population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These Macanese, including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the Macanese community is the ‰∏äÊµ∑Ëë°ÂÉë; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the \\"Paris of the Orient\\". They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the Red Guard. Many spoke little Portuguese and were several generations removed from Portugal, speaking primarily English and Shanghainese, and/or Mandarin. The Shanghai Macanese carved a niche by teaching English in Macau. Only the children and grandchildren of Shanghainese settlers who were born and raised in Macau have the ability to speak Portuguese. A number of Macanese also emigrated during the Carnation Revolution and Macau's return to the People's Republic of China, respectively. Most potential emigrants looked to Brazil, Portugal's African territories, and Australia. =The Post-Colonial Period = Beginning with the post-1974 independence of other Portuguese colonies and hastened by Macau's return to China, the Macanese community began to lose its Portuguese heritage. Many Portuguese, Eurasians and Chinese who were loyal to the Portuguese left after its return to China. Of those that remained, many children ‚Äì including those of pure Chinese descent ‚Äì switched from Portuguese- to English-medium high school education, particularly as many of parents recognised the diminishing value of Portuguese schooling. Many Macanese people of mixed ancestry since Portuguese time never speak Portuguese and speak only Cantonese as first language; if other Macanese people of mixed ancestry speak Portuguese, they speak it as second language, thus affected by Cantonese accent. At the same time, Macanese of pure Portuguese descent are also learning Cantonese and Mandarin to be able to communicate to non-Portuguese- speaking Chinese. Today, most Macanese ‚Äì if they are still young enough ‚Äì would go back to study to read and write Chinese. Many see a niche role for fluent speakers of Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin. Code-switching between Portuguese, Cantonese, and Mandarin among native speakers is common. In the 1980s Macanese or Portuguese women began to marry men who identified themselves as Chinese.  Macanese identity dispute  There is some dispute around the exact meaning of \\"Macanese\\". An essay by Marreiros offers a broad spectrum of \\"Macanese types\\", ranging from Chinese Christian converts who live among the Portuguese to the descendants of old-established families of Portuguese lineage; all groups are integrated into this historically legitimated group. As a general rule, it is not a point of reference, however for ethnic Chinese living and raised in Macau; they often identify themselves as Chinese or Chinese from Macau; \\"Macanese\\" is applied to those people who have been acculturated through Western education and religion and are recognized by the Macanese community as being Macanese.There are many pretenders who have claimed to be Macanese. Although one's ethnic identity is a personal project, ultimately, any claim to a Macanese identity is either accepted or refuted by the already existing Macanese community on criteria dependent upon shared cultural heritage and collective notions (these criteria shift with each emerging generation). As Turner and later Bhabka suggest, identity is a layering of experiences unraveled through contact with others and is only decipherable within the social sphere. There are limits to a Macanese identity, and Pina-Cabral and Louren√ßo (op. cit.), offer a broad- based definition delineated by family and community acceptance as two basic denominators for a tentative definition of the Macanese. Traditionally, the basis for Macanese ethnic affiliation has been the use of the Portuguese language at home or some alliances with Portuguese cultural patterns and not solely determined along hereditary lines. Pina-Cabral and Louren√ßo suggest that this goal is reached \\"namely through the Portuguese-language school- system\\".Pina-Cabral and Louren√ßo (1993). Tentatively, language is not so much a key determinant to Macanese identity, but rather the alliance with the Portuguese cultural system that knowing Portuguese entails. A great number of Macanese families of Hong Kong only speak English but are still considered Macanese. Along these lines, knowledge of Portuguese is preferably ‚Äì but not absolutely necessary ‚Äì for a Macanese identity. It should be mentioned, however, that Portuguese language use is only one of several criteria that are used by other Macaense to determine other Macanese, not the sole determinant. Often, due to the close proximity to the Portuguese, the Macanese closely identify themselves with Portuguese nationals as opposed to Chinese in the bi- cultural and bi-racial equation. In practice, however, being Macanese is left up to how individuals categorize themselves. In the mid-1990s, there had been attempts by the Macau government to redefine the Macanese to be everyone born in Macau regardless of ethnicity, language or nationality. Since the re- integration of Macau with the People's Republic of China in late 1999, the traditional definitions are in a state of re-formulation.Shifting, not in the sense of deconstruction of the identity definition, but a re-formulation of the definition as each rising generation dictates. The current generation is looking toward the transition and finding themselves deciding upon their cultural/identity alignments. However, as Pina-Cabral and Louren√ßo explain, this is the nature of the Macanese community. Given the shifting political climate of Macau, some Macanese are coming to recognize and identify closer with a Chinese heritage. This ambiguity might be reduced by the further adjective crioulo.

She is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Commissioned in August 1943, Intrepid participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, most notably the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). In her second career, she served mainly in the Atlantic, but also participated in the Vietnam War. Her notable achievements include being the recovery ship for a Mercury and a Gemini space mission. Because of her prominent role in battle, she was nicknamed \\"the Fighting I\\", while her frequent bad luck and time spent in dry dock for repairs‚Äîshe was torpedoed once and hit by four separate Japanese kamikaze aircraft‚Äîearned her the nicknames \\"Decrepit\\" and \\"the Dry I\\". Decommissioned in 1974, in 1982 Intrepid became the foundation of the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Service history The keel for Intrepid was laid down on 1 December 1941 in Shipway 10 at the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entrance into World War II. She was launched on 26 April 1943, the fifth to be launched. She was sponsored by the wife of Vice Admiral John H. Hoover. On 16 August 1943, she was commissioned with Captain Thomas L. Sprague in command before heading to the Caribbean for shakedown and training. She thereafter returned to Norfolk, before departing on 3 December, bound for San Francisco. She proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving there on 10 January, where she began preparations to join the rest of the Pacific Fleet for offensive operations against the Imperial Japanese Navy. =World War II= Central Pacific operations Intrepid off Hunter's Point in June 1944, her deck loaded with aircraft to be transported to the Pacific Theater Intrepid joined the Fast Carrier Task Force, then Task Force 58 (TF 58), for the next operation in the island-hopping campaign across the Central Pacific: the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. On 16 January 1944, Intrepid, her sister ship , and the light carrier left Pearl Harbor to conduct a raid on islands in the Kwajalein Atoll from 29 January to 2 February. The three carriers' air group destroyed all 83 Japanese aircraft stationed on Roi-Namur in the first two days of the strikes, before Marines went ashore on neighboring islands on 31 January in the Battle of Kwajalein. That morning, aircraft from Intrepid attacked Japanese beach defenses on Ennuebing Island, up until ten minutes before the first Marines landed. The Marines quickly took the island and used it as a fire base to support the follow-on attack on Roi. With the fighting in the Kwajalein Atoll finished by 3 February, Intrepid and the rest of TF 58 proceeded to launch Operation Hailstone, a major raid on the main Japanese naval base in the Central Pacific, Truk Lagoon. From 17 to 19 February, the carriers pounded Japanese forces in the lagoon, sinking two destroyers and some of merchant ships. Additionally, the strikes demonstrated the vulnerability of Truk, which convinced the Japanese to avoid using it in the future. Intrepid did not emerge from the operation unscathed, however. On the night of 17-18 February, a Japanese torpedo bomber scored a hit on the carrier near her stern. The torpedo struck below the waterline, jamming the ship's rudder to port and flooding several compartments. Sprague was able to counteract the jammed rudder by running the port side screw at high speed while idling the starboard screw for two days until high winds overpowered the improvised steering. The crew then fashioned a jury rigged sail out of scrap canvas and hatch covers, which allowed the ship to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 24 February. Temporary repairs were effected there, after which Intrepid steamed to Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for permanent repairs on 16 March, arriving there six days later. The work was completed by 9 June, and Intrepid began two months of training around Pearl Harbor. Starting in early September, Intrepid joined operations in the western Caroline Islands; the Fast Carrier Task Force was now part of the Third Fleet under Admiral William Halsey Jr., and had been renamed Task Force 38. On 6 and 7 September, she conducted air strikes on Japanese artillery batteries and airfields on the island of Peleliu, in preparation for the invasion of Peleliu. On 9 and 10 September, she and the rest of the fleet moved on to attack airfields on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, followed by further strikes on bases in the Visayan Sea between 12 and 14 September. On 17 September, Intrepid returned to Pelelieu to provide air support to the Marines that had landed on the island two days before. Philippines campaign Intrepid launching an aircraft during the Battle of Leyte Gulf Musashi under fire 24 October 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf Intrepid and the other carriers then returned to the Philippines to prepare for the Philippines campaign. At this time, Intrepid was assigned to Task Group 38.2. In addition to targets in the Philippines themselves, the carriers also struck Japanese airfields on the islands of Formosa and Okinawa to degrade Japanese air power in the region. On 20 October, at the start of the Battle of Leyte, Intrepid launched strikes to support Allied forces as they went ashore on the island of Leyte. By this time, Halsey reduced the carriers of TG 38.2 to just Intrepid, Cabot, and the light carrier commanded by Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan aboard Intrepid. Between 23 and 26 October, the Japanese Navy launched a major operation to disrupt the Allied landings in the Philippines, resulting in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On the morning of 24 October, a reconnaissance aircraft from Intrepid spotted Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's flagship, . Two hours later, Intrepid and Cabot launched a strike on Kurita's Center Force, initiating the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea; this included eight Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers from Intrepid, which launched their attack at 10:27. One bomb struck the roof of Turret No. 1, failing to penetrate. Two minutes later, the battleship Musashi was struck starboard amidships by a torpedo from a Grumman TBF Avenger, also from Intrepid. In return, the Japanese shot down a pair of Avengers. Another eight Helldivers from Intrepid attacked Musashi again at around noon, scoring two more hits, with two Helldivers shot down. Three minutes later, nine Avengers attacked from both sides of the ship, scoring three torpedo hits on the port side. Further strikes from and inflicted several more bomb and torpedo hits at around 13:30. At 15:25, Musashi was attacked by 37 aircraft from Intrepid, the fleet carrier and Cabot. These aircraft scored hits with 13 bombs and 11 torpedoes during this attack, for the loss of three Avengers and three Helldivers. In addition to the loss of Musashi, many of Kurita's other ships, including Yamato, the battleships and , and heavy cruiser were damaged in the attacks, forcing him to break off the operation temporarily. A U.S. Navy Curtiss SB2C-3 Helldiver caught in the after radio mast of the aircraft carrier USS Intrepid (CV-11) after a night landing accident on 30 October 1944. The plane was assigned to Bombing Squadron 7 (VB-7) aboard USS Hancock (CV-19). Crewmen aboard watch as a Japanese plane prepares to strike Intrepid 25 November 1944 After Kurita's force began to withdraw, Halsey ordered TF 38 to steam north to intercept the aircraft carriers of the Northern Force, commanded by Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa. Bogan correctly perceived that Ozawa's force was intended to lure TF 38 away from the landing area to allow Kurita to attack it, but Halsey overruled him and several other Task Group commanders who voiced similar concerns. Early on 25 October, aircraft from Intrepid and the other carriers launched a strike on the Japanese carriers. Aircraft from Intrepid scored hits on the carrier and possibly the carrier . Further strikes throughout the morning resulted in the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers and a destroyer in the Battle off Cape Enga√±o. Halsey's preoccupation with the Northern Force allowed Kurita the respite he needed to turn his force back to the east, push through the San Bernardino Strait, where it engaged the light forces of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts that were directly covering the landing force in the Battle off Samar. Kurita nevertheless failed to break through the American formation, and ultimately broke off the attack. On 27 October, TG 38.2 returned to operations over Luzon; these included a raid on Manila on 29 October. That day, a kamikaze hit Intrepid on one of her port side gun positions; damage was minimal though ten men were killed and another six were wounded. A Japanese air raid on 25 November struck the fleet shortly after noon. Two kamikazes crashed into Intrepid, killing sixty-six men and causing a serious fire. The ship remained on station, however, and the fires were extinguished within two hours. She was detached for repairs the following day, and reached San Francisco on 20 December. Okinawa and Japan, March‚ÄìDecember 1945 In the middle of February 1945, back in fighting trim, the carrier steamed for Ulithi, arriving on 13 March. She set off westward for strikes on Japan on 14 March and four days later launched strikes against airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´. That morning a twin-engined Japanese G4M \\"Betty\\" broke through a curtain of defensive fire turned toward Intrepid and exploded only 50 ft (15 m) off Intrepids forward boat crane. A shower of flaming gasoline and aircraft parts started fires on the hangar deck, but damage control teams quickly put them out. Intrepids aircraft joined attacks on remnants of the Japanese fleet anchored at Kure damaging 18 enemy naval vessels, including battleship Yamato and carrier . The carriers turned to Okinawa as L-Day, the start of the most ambitious amphibious assault of the Pacific war, approached. Between 26 and 27 March, their aircraft attacked the Ry≈´ky≈´s, softening up enemy defensive works. The invasion began on 1 April. Intrepid aircraft flew support missions against targets on Okinawa and made neutralizing raids against Japanese airfields in range of the island. On 16 April, during an air raid, a Japanese aircraft dove into Intrepids flight deck forcing the engine and part of her fuselage right on through, killing eight men and wounding 21. In less than an hour the flaming gasoline had been extinguished, and only three hours after the crash, aircraft were again landing on the carrier. On 17 April, Intrepid retired homeward via Ulithi. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor on 11 May, arriving at San Francisco for repairs on 19 May. On 29 June, the carrier left San Francisco. On 6 August, her aircraft launched strikes against Japanese on bypassed Wake Island. Intrepid arrived at Eniwetok on the next day. On 15 August, when the Japanese surrendered, she received word to \\"cease offensive operations.\\" Intrepid got under way on 21 August to support the occupation of Japan. On 2 December, she left Yokosuka and arrived at San Pedro, California, on 15 December. =Post-war= Top views of USS Intrepid after SCB-27C (left) and SCB-125 (right). Decommissioning and conversion to attack carrier On 4 February 1946, Intrepid moved to San Francisco Bay. The carrier was reduced in status to \\"commission in reserve\\" on 15 August, and she was decommissioned on 22 March 1947. After her decommissioning, the Intrepid became part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. On 9 February 1952, she was recommissioned and on 12 March began the voyage to Norfolk, where the carrier would receive SCB-27C modernization to operate jet aircraft as an attack aircraft carrier. On 9 April, the Intrepid was temporarily decommissioned for the modernization at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. On 1 October, she was reclassified as attack carrier CVA-11 and recommissioned in reserve on 18 June 1954. On 13 October, the carrier became the first to launch aircraft with American-built steam catapults. Two days later, the Intrepid became part of the Atlantic Fleet in full commission. 1955‚Äì1961 In 1955, Intrepid conducted her shakedown cruise out of Guant√°namo Bay. On 28 May, she departed Mayport, Florida, for the first of two deployments in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet. The Intrepid returned to Norfolk from the second deployment on 5 September. On 29 September, she entered the New York Navy Yard for her SCB-125 modernization, which added an enclosed bow and an angled flight deck. After the end of the modernization in April 1957, Intrepid conducted refresher training out of Guant√°namo Bay. In September, she participated in Operation Strikeback, the largest peacetime naval exercise up to that time in history, which simulated a Soviet attack on NATO. In December, operating from Norfolk, she conducted Operation Crosswind, a study of the effects of wind on carrier launches. The study proved that carriers could safely conduct flight operations without turning into the wind and even launch aircraft while steaming downwind. Between 1958 and 1961, Intrepid alternated Mediterranean deployments with operations along the Atlantic coast of the United States and exercises in the Caribbean. 1962‚Äì1965 The Gemini 3 spacecraft alongside Intrepid, 23 March 1965. Intrepid was reclassified to an anti- submarine warfare carrier, CVS-11, on 8 December 1961. On 10 March 1962, the carrier entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul and refit for her new anti- submarine warfare role. After the completion of the overhaul and refit, she departed on 2 April with Carrier Antisubmarine Air Group 56 embarked. After training exercises, Intrepid was selected as the principal ship in the recovery team for astronaut Scott Carpenter and his Project Mercury space capsule, Aurora 7. Shortly before noon on 24 May 1962, Carpenter splashed down in Aurora 7 northeast of Puerto Rico and several hundred miles from Intrepid. Minutes after he was located by land-based search aircraft, two helicopters from Intrepid, carrying NASA officials, medical experts, Navy frogmen, and photographers, were airborne and headed to the rescue. One of the choppers picked him up over an hour later and flew him to the carrier which safely returned him to the United States. Intrepid spent the summer of 1962 training midshipmen at sea, and received a thorough overhaul at Norfolk in the fall. On 23 January 1963, the carrier departed Hampton Roads for warfare exercises in the Caribbean. In late February, she interrupted these operations to join a sea hunt for the Venezuelan freighter Anzo√°tegui, whose mutinous second mate had led a group of pro-Castro terrorists in hijacking the vessel. After the Communist pirates had surrendered at Rio de Janeiro, the carrier returned to Norfolk on 23 March. Intrepid operated along the Atlantic Coast for the next year from Nova Scotia to the Caribbean perfecting her antisubmarine techniques. On 11 June 1964, she left Norfolk carrying midshipmen to the Mediterranean for a hunter-killer at sea training with the 6th Fleet. While in the Mediterranean, Intrepid aided in the surveillance of a Soviet task group. En route home her crew learned that she had won the coveted Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" for antisubmarine warfare during the previous fiscal year. In the fall of 1964, the carrier operated along the East Coast. In early September, Intrepid entertained 22 NATO statesmen as part of their tour of U.S. military installations. Between 18‚Äì19 October 1964, the Intrepid was at Yorktown for ceremonies commemorating Lord Cornwallis's surrender 183 years before. The French Ambassador attended the ceremony and presented the U.S. with 12 cannon cast from molds found in the Bastille, replicas of those brought to American forces by Lafayette. On the night of 21 November, during a brief deployment off North Carolina, swift and efficient rescue procedures saved the life of an airman Jenner Sanders, who fell overboard while driving an aircraft towing tractor. In early 1965, Intrepid began preparations for a vital role in NASA's first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3. On 23 March, Lieutenant Commander John Young and Major Gus Grissom in Molly Brown (the Gemini 3 spacecraft) splashed down some from Intrepid after history's first controlled re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere ended the pair's nearly perfect three-orbit flight aboard Gemini 3. A Navy helicopter lifted the astronauts from the spacecraft and flew them to Intrepid for medical examination and debriefing. Later, Intrepid retrieved Molly Brown and returned the spacecraft and astronauts to Cape Kennedy. 1965‚Äì1974 Intrepid operating as an auxiliary attack carrier off Vietnam, 1966. After this mission Intrepid entered the Brooklyn Navy Yard in April for a major overhaul to bring her back to peak combat readiness. This was the final Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization job performed by the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, which was scheduled to close. In September 1965, Intrepid, with her work approximately 75% completed, eased down the East River to moor at the Naval Supply Depot at Bayonne, New Jersey, for the completion of her multimillion-dollar overhaul. After builder's sea trials and fitting out at Norfolk she sailed to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba on a shakedown cruise. From April 1966 to February 1969, Intrepid made three Vietnam deployments, with Carrier Air Wing 10 embarked.http://www.gonavy.jp/CVW-AK1f.html Mid-1966 found Intrepid with the Pacific Fleet off Vietnam. Nine A-4 Skyhawks and six A-1 Skyraiders, loaded with bombs and rockets, were catapulted in seven minutes, with only a 28-second interval between launches. A few days later planes were launched at 26-second intervals. After seven months of service with the United States Seventh Fleet off Vietnam, Intrepid returned to Norfolk having earned her commanding officer, Captain John W. Fair, the Legion of Merit for combat operations in Southeast Asia. On 9 October 1966 Lieutenant, junior grade William T. Patton of VA-176 from Intrepid, flying a propeller driven A-1H Skyraider, shot down one MiG-17. For the action, Lieutenant (jg) Patton was awarded the Silver Star. In June 1967, Intrepid returned to the Western Pacific by way of the Suez Canal just prior to its closing during the Israeli- Arab crisis. There she began another tour with the Seventh Fleet. In 1968, Intrepid won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. For Carrier Air Wing 10's final cruise aboard Intrepid from 4 June 1968 to 8 February 1969 off Southeast Asia, the wing consisted of VF-111 Detachment 11 (F-8C), VA-106 with the A-4E, VA-66 Waldos (A-4C), VFP-63 Detachment 11 (RF-8G), VA-36 'Roadrunners' (A-4C), VAQ-33 Detachment 11 (EA-1F), VAW-121 Detachment 11 (E-1B), and HC-2 Detachment 11. Intrepid operating in the Mediterranean in the 1970s. In 1969, Intrepid was home ported at Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island, relieving as the flagship for Commander Carrier Division 16. In the fall, the ship was run aground by Captain Horus E. Moore, but was freed within two hours. From April‚ÄìOctober 1971, Intrepid took part in NATO exercises, and made calls in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean ports of Lisbon, Plymouth, Kiel, Naples, Cannes, Barcelona, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Greenock, Rosyth, Portsmouth, and Bergen. During this cruise, submarine detection operations were conducted in the Baltic and at the edge of the Barents Sea above the Arctic Circle, under close scrutiny of Soviet air and naval forces. She subsequently returned to her homeport to be refitted. Beginning in July 1972, Intrepid participated once again in NATO exercises, visiting Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Bergen, Brussels, Portsmouth and Gourock. Intrepid found herself in the Barents and made round the clock flight operations as she was above the Arctic Circle. She cut her North Atlantic cruise short, returned to Quonset Point for a mini-overhaul. She made her final cruise in the Mediterranean, stopping twice in Barcelona and Malaga Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; Nice, France; Naples, Italy; Palma, Majorca; and Piraeus, Greece once. Due to fuel limitations Intrepid spent as much time in port as she did underway. On 15 March 1974, Intrepid was decommissioned for the final time. Preservation as museum ship In 1976, Intrepid was moored at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia and hosted exhibits as part of the United States Bicentennial celebrations. Plans originally called for Intrepid to be scrapped after decommissioning, but a campaign led by real estate developers Zachary and Larry Fisher and the Intrepid Museum Foundation saved the carrier and established it as a museum ship. In August 1982, the ship opened at Pier 86 on the Hudson River in New York City as the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum. Four years later, Intrepid was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark. and Over the years, Intrepid has hosted many special events including wrestling events, press conferences, parties and the FBI operations center after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. =2006‚Äì2008 renovation= Throughout the last several years, the Intrepid museum has operated a fund for the restoration, raising over $60 million to refit Intrepid, to improve its exhibits for visitors, and improve Pier 86\\\\. In early July 2006, it was announced that Intrepid would undergo renovations and repairs, along with Pier 86 itself. It closed on 1 October 2006, in preparation for its towing to Bayonne, New Jersey, for repairs, and later Staten Island, New York, for renovation and temporary docking. On 6 November 2006, an attempt to remove the aircraft carrier from the pier for restoration was temporarily put on hold by the Coast Guard. Despite the use of several tugs with a combined , officials said the ship was stuck in 24 years worth of accumulated silt and would not move. On 11 November 2006, the United States Navy announced that it would spend $3 million to dredge the mud and silt from under Intrepid. The effort was led by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving with assistance from the United States Army Corps of Engineers, United States Coast Guard, and contractors. The teams operated for three weeks to clear the site of mud and silt. On 5 December 2006, after the removal of of muck from under the ship and around its four giant screws, Intrepid was successfully removed from its pier and was towed to Bayonne.\\"Briefly, Slowly, Intrepid Moves Again\\" ‚Äì New York Times Intrepid made a D-Day \\"landing\\" on Staten Island, 6 June 2007, after being towed from a slip at Bayonne Dry Dock & Repair Corp. While in Staten Island, Intrepid underwent the next phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8 million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general berthing quarters and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her original weight in steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new coat of paint, using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120 million‚Äî$55 million for the ship and $65 million for Pier 86.Pyle, Richard, \\"Aircraft carrier survived wars, years of decay\\", Associated Press (printed in the Washington Times, p. 10), 30 September 2008. The carrier was towed back into place on the Hudson River on 2 October 2008 and reopened to the public on 8 November. On 12 December 2011, ownership of the Space Shuttle Enterprise was officially transferred to the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. In preparation for the anticipated relocation, engineers evaluated the vehicle in early 2010 and determined that it was safe to fly on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft once again. At approximately 9:40 am Eastern Daylight Time on 27 April 2012 Enterprise took off from Dulles International Airport en route to a fly-by over the Hudson River, New York's JFK International Airport, the Statue of Liberty, the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, and several other landmarks in the city; in an approximately 45-minute \\"final tour\\". At 11:23 am Eastern Daylight Time Enterprise touched down at JFK International Airport.

History The company was founded by brothers Paul and Michael Donovan in 1983. Paul Donovan was trained as a director at the London Film School; Michael graduated from Dalhousie University‚Äôs Law School and began as a producer of Paul‚Äôs film projects. Salter Street Films was named after the street in Halifax where Paul and Michael had been living. The company began life with early problems. Its first major feature film was Def-Con 4 (1985) which eventually became profitable, but other pictures such as George's Island (1989), Buried on Sunday (1992) and Paint Cans (1994), though critically acclaimed, were money-losers. The company's salvation turned out to be the science fiction series Lexx,Salter Street Films Announces U.S. Premiere of LEXX on The SCI FI Channel BUSINESS WIRE, Sept. 30, 1999 which was a hit in Germany, Russia and Eastern Europe. This Canadian-German co- production went on to become a lucrative money-maker through international sales and was one of the first shows to develop a cult following almost exclusively through the Internet. Concurrently, the Donovan brothers found success with the satirical This Hour Has 22 Minutes becoming a hit on CBC Television as well as other series such as CODCO, Emily of New Moon, Made in Canada, Blackfly, the children's series Pirates and the special Rick Mercer's Talking To Americans. These shows found homes on the CBC as well as other Canadian networks and cable channels. Salter Street also created the Stop motion children's show Poko which is still in production. Based on their reputation for political satire, American documentary film-maker Michael Moore approached Salter Street to produce his Bowling for Columbine project. Michael Donovan agreed, and arranged financing in Canada and Germany. The documentary won both the Anniversary Prize at Cannes and the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature. In 2000, a year after the Donovan brothers had taken the company public, Salter Street Films was awarded the broadcast licence for the Independent Film Channel by the CRTC. This potentially lucrative award, combined with SSF‚Äôs reputation as a content-provider, attracted interest from the powerful media corporation Alliance Atlantis. Alliance Atlantis bought Salter Street from the majority shareholders the following year.Alliance Atlantis buys Salter Street Films February 12, 2001, CBC News Paul and Michael Donovan remained on as producers. Acquisition and close In 2003, two years after the purchase, Alliance Atlantis closed the operation, transferring Salter Street's ongoing television productions to Alliance. Paul Donovan has continued as an independent producer and director. In May 2004, Michael Donovan has formed the Halifax Film Company with many of the former Salter Street employees. In 2006, Halifax Film merged with Decode Entertainment to form DHX Media.
