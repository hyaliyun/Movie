She is mainly known from her unrobbed tomb containing a set of outstanding personal adornments. Khenmet is only known from her burial next to the pyramid of Amenemhat II at Dahshur. On the West side of the pyramid were three underground galleries with each of two tombs. Four of these tombs, including those of Khenmet as well as Ita and Itaweret were found unlooted. Khenmet was buried in a set of three containers. There was an outer, undecorated sarcophagus, next, a wooden coffin, decorated on the outside with gold foil and on the inside with hieroglyphic texts. Finally there was an inner anthropoid coffin, that was found only badly preserved. The body of Khenmet was adorned with an array of jewellery including a broad collar, armlets, and anklets. Next to the body were found many weapons, typical for royal burials of the Middle Kingdom.Jacques de Morgan et al.: Fouilles a Dahchour 1894-1895. Band 2, Holzhausen, Vienna 1903, p. 55-68. In the small chamber next to the sarcophagus were found further personal adornments. These included two crowns and parts of a necklace made in gold. The latter is most likely not an Egyptian work of art, but was perhaps produced in Crete. The father of Khenmet is uncertain. From the position of the burial, next to the pyramid of Amenemhat II it seems likely that she was his daughter.

That‚Äôs why we decided to engage them via a contest, and the response was overwhelming.\\" Tamil Nadu Premier League team Chepauk Super Gillies unveiled their jersey, logo and anthem at a glittering ceremony.

Former India skipper Azharuddin said the league would benefit Tamil Nadu players. \\"The players from the rural areas get a great opportunity to get into the limelight through this league. The Chepauk team is a young side and I am sure that they would do well in the league,\\" Azharuddin added. Former India pacer Zaheer Khan said being in Chennai brought a lot of good memories as he started his career here. \\"I congratulate the TNCA for initiating a league like this. I hope this becomes a huge success,\\" he said.  Team History   TNPL Season 1 (2016)  The Chennai-based side which enjoyed the humongous support of the iconic MA Chidambaram Stadium. The side called upon the hugely experienced Hemang Badani as coach while R Sathish as the skipper. Players: R Sathish, Yo Mahesh, Thalaivan Sargunam, Anthony Dhas, Gopinath, Sai Kishore, Sasidev, Joel Joseph, Tamil Kumaran, Alaxander R, Vasanth Saravanan S, Rahul B, Ashwath Mukunthan, Karthik S, Rajeel Abdul Rahman, Nirmal Kumar, Vasudevan, Aditya Barooah, Shibi Jawahar. Tuti Patriots were crowned champions of the inaugural Tamil Nadu Premier League when they beat Chepauk Super Gillies by a whopping 122 runs in a dominating final at the M A Chidambaram Stadium here on Sunday. The league came a full circle as the teams that played the first match played the last match too and the result, too, was the same with Tuti Patriots emerging supreme. Things went completely wrong for Rajagopal Sathish's men from the start as the skipper was on the wrong side of the coin. Dinesh Karthik didn't have any qualms in batting first and Gillies woes started. Chepauk Super Gillies were sent on a leather hunt from the word go as Tuti openers Abhinav Mukund (82* off 52 balls) and Kaushik Gandhi (59 off 43 balls) made merry. Dinesh Karthik added a boisterous finishing touch scoring a quick- fire 55 in 26 balls to propel Patriots to 215/2 in 20 overs. Chasing 216, Patriots spinner M Ganesh Moorthi (4/11) then sealed the match in the first over with a hat-trick when he sent X Thalaivan Sargunam, K H Gopinath, Sathish and Sasidev in the space of six balls, with the last three in as many balls. Chepauk Super Gillies could only manage 93 in 18.5 overs. Moorthi was named the man-of-the-match. The match went into the record books for the highest team score (215), highest opening partnership at Chepauk (132), most wickets in an over (4) and the lowest team total (93). The slide started when Thalaivan came down the track off the second ball only to loft the ball over wide mid-off for Anand Subramaniam to take a sensational catch running backwards. Gopinath was the next to go when he cut the ball straight to the point fielder while Sathish misjudged the spin to be caught out plumb in front of the next ball. Sasidev couldn't prevent the hat-trick when he got an outside edge for L Balaji to take a neat catch at first slip. S Vasanth Saravanan and Yo Mahesh tried to resurrect the innings with a 33-run partnership for the fifth wicket but Chepauk never recovered from Moorthi's blows. Balaji removed Yo Mahesh as a steady drizzle forced the players indoors for a brief while. Aushik Srinivas took a neat low catch at mid-off to send J Gowjith Subash (8) back and once Saravanan's timber was rocked by Balaji for 30, the curtains came down on Chepauk Super Gillies. A steady drizzle only delayed the inevitable for a few minutes as Gillies were bundled out for 93 in the 19th over. Earlier, Mukund, who started from where left off in the first semi-final at Tirunelveli, made his intent clear when he took Ashwath Mukundhan to the cleaners in the bowler's second over scoring 18 runs. Gandhi, who started off playing the perfect second fiddle, started accelerating as Patriots found the boundaries with ease. A rollicking drive in the extra cover region off Mahesh set things up for the right-hander as he got into the groove easily. At the half-way stage, Patriots were looking for a huge score by scoring at more than nine runs an over. The openers got to their half- centuries soon after and Mukund started to cut loose. He sent left-arm spinners R Alexander and R Sai Kishore out of the park in consecutive overs as Cheapuk Super Gillies ran out of ideas to keep the Patriots batsmen quiet. Kishore broke the 132-run partnership in the 14th over when Gandhi mistimed a sweep to square-leg where Saravanan took an easy catch. The breakthrough brought more sorrow for Super Gillies as Dinesh Karthik joined Mukund and they went on a rampage by scoring 82 in 37 balls, with Karthik scoring 55 of them in 26 balls. Karthik found the ropes with ease in a 360-degree fashion by picking up a boundary and a six almost every over as the Patriots crossed the 200-run mark at the end of the penultimate over. Karthik was run out in the second last ball, leaving Mukund stranded short of another well-deserved century as Patriots ended at 215.  TNPL Season 2 (2017)  With largely the same squad that got to the final last time around, veteran Rajagopal Sathish will be hoping to take his side one step further this time around. Squad: Rajagopal Sathish, Yo Mahesh, Thalaivan Sargunam, Antony Dhas, Gopinath, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Uthirasamy Sasidev, Joel Joseph, Dakshinamoorthy Kumaran, R Alexander, Sathiamoorty Saravanan, Baskaran Rahul, Ashwath Mukumthan, S Karthik, Aditya Barooah, Jothimani Gowjith Subhash, Arun Kumar, Rangaraj Suthesh, S Radhakrishnan. Five was the magic number for Chepauk Super Gillies as they beat Albert TuTi Patriots by six wickets in the final of the second edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League in Chennai. Chasing 144 for victory, Super Gillies were stuttering and stumbling towards the finish line before captain R Satish and Vasanth Saravanan stitched an unbeaten 52-run partnership for the fifth wicket to take them home. Before the start of the final, Super Gillies had lost four games in a row against TuTi Patriots, who were on a 13-game unbeaten run in the tournament. But history was rewritten at the MA Chidambaram Stadium where Chepauk finally beat TuTi in their fifth attempt.

Belgian beer culture includes traditions of craftsmanship for brewing beer and is part of the diet and social life of Belgians. Its cultural value was formally recognized in 2016 when it was added to UNESCO's \\"Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\\" list. Background The range of traditional Belgian beer available is due to a variety of brewing processes, methods of fermentation, the use of yeasts and other ingredients, and traditional knowledge passed through families and breweries for centuries. This results in beers of different colours and textures. While Belgium beer production is less than one percent of world beer production, and there are fewer breweries in Belgium than in some states of the US, Belgium has more diversity in beer styles than any beer-producing region. Many local Belgian beers are brewed in micro-breweries. These operations range from small-scale micro-breweries run by individuals or small amateur clubs that produce less than 10 hectolitres per year to larger commercial operations that produce thousands of hectolitres of beer annually. There are also beer firms that commercialize beer (sometimes with their own recipes) under their own brand, and local brewers who brew for them as Etiket or 'contractors'. There are some large breweries and two global players with Inbev (formerly Interbrew/Stella Artois) and Alken-Maes (Heineken Group). A large quantity of beer is produced in Belgium for export. In 2016, a total of 20,600,000 hL (2.06 million L) was produced which is higher than the 19,811,000 hLBeer Statistics 2016 Edition. (2016). 1st ed.

In 2016, a total of 14,100,000 hL (1.41 million L) was exported globally, an increase from the 13,025,000 hL exported in 2015. In contrast to the growth of beer production and export, beer consumption in Belgium has declined. In 2016 beer consumption dropped 3.3% from 7,950,000 hL to 7,700,000 hL. Belgium ranks 15th in consumption of beer per capita in Europe. Belgians consume a large quantity of beer in a wide variety of brands. There are over 800 varieties of beer brewed in Belgium, and all are in high demand. In 2016, a total of 7,689,148 hL (768.91 million L) of beer was consumed, which is 70-75L of beer per capita. Beer consumption in Belgium is a social event, both in private and in public. People offer beer to guests in their homes or enjoy beer with friends at a pub or restaurant. Most everyday activities either start or end with a beer. Although the number of pubs in Belgium has been declining over the last few decades, every village has at least one local caf√©. In the early 20th century, Belgium had over 3,000 breweries and more than 200,000 caf√©s‚Äîa caf√© for every five houses. The number of caf√©s, bistros, taverns, and caf√©-restaurants has since declined; at the end of 2005, Belgium (10 mi inhabitants, 30,000km2) counted 19,300 establishments that were listed as caf√©s (down from 25,500 in 1998). According to a 2016 sector survey, Belgium has 57,500 hotel, restaurant, and caf√© enterprises, with over 80,000 outlets; about 37,500 of these are categorized as restaurants. Belgian beer culture is most visible in the diversity of beer offered in every pub. A typical beer menu offers at least half a dozen draught beers and two dozen bottled beers of different types. Some degustation caf√©s will offer over 100 different beers and more than a dozen draught beers. Degustation caf√©s also offer tastings for parties of four or more. A party of four can order four beers and get 16 glasses to share, so each member can taste 1/4 of each beer. In addition, Belgium has specific beer supermarkets offering a wide variety of beer from multiple producers. Many restaurants offer beer on their menu cards or operate as cafe and restaurants. The market share of specialty beers in the Belgian market rose in the period between 1990 and 2013 from 10% to 30%. The number of beer varieties has increased from 750 to over 1,600.Alle Belgische Bieren, Ed. Hilde Deweer, Stichting Kunstboek Oostkamp, 2015 Intangible Cultural Heritage Flemish Minister Joke Schauvliege added Belgian beer culture to the Flemish Heritage Inventory. On 30 November 2016, it was announced that Belgian beer culture had been added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Beer culture Brewing and tradition Beer is a part of everyday life in Belgium. Until the 1960s, children eating lunch at school could choose from tea, coffee, or beer (the so-called \\"table beer\\", blond or sour-brown, which is very low in alcohol). In the 1980s at university restaurants, drink choices were still water and table beer; soft drinks were introduced in the mid-1970s. Most weeks there is a beer festival somewhere in the country, attracting thousands of visitors. Some festivals have an international reputation, whereas others simply celebrate a local village beer. Besides omnipresent beer, caf√©s, breweries, and brewing fanatics, there are also several beer museums to be found across the country. Each showcases a different aspect of Belgian beer culture, and each one takes its own unique approach. While some focus on hops and others on transport or history, all of the beer museums in Belgium share one thing in common‚Äîthey are run by true beer-lovers committed to their passion for Belgian beer. Beer culture is a prominent part of Belgium's history and its folklore. Belgians' love for beer has left a mark in their history books and has created legends that live on today. One legend says that St. Gambrinus, the 'saint of beer', who is said to have introduced hops, is buried in Brussels only meters away from the Brewers House on the Grand Place. St. Gambrinus or Arnold of Soissons The legend of St. Gambrinus seems to go back to John I, Duke of Brabant (c. 1252‚Äì1294), John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy (1371‚Äì1419) and was written down from the oral tradition by Bavarian historiographer Johannes Aventinus. John I's dukedom, the Duchy of Brabant, was a wealthy beer- producing area. The brewers' guild in Brussels made the Duke an honorary member and hung his portrait in their meeting hall. In his 1874 monograph on Gambrinus, Victor Coremans reported that references to Brabant and Flanders in the Gambrinus legends seemed recent, but a similarity between the likeness of John I on his tomb and the faces in some illustrations was remarkable. Moreover, the Saint's name seems to have a hypothetical connection: John I was sometimes known as Jan Primus, and Gambrinus might be a corruption of the duke's name. The real patron saint of hop-pickers and brewers is Arnold Bishop of Soisson (ca 1040‚Äì1087), the founder of the Abbey of St. Peter in Oudenburg. In Oudenburg, the friars brewed beer, a vital product in medieval life. Arnold allegedly encouraged the local peasants to drink beer, instead of water, due to its 'gift of health'. During one outbreak of illness, which caused many deaths among the population, Arnold advised the local people to avoid consuming water in favour of beer, which saved many lives. History These legends demonstrate that brewing in this part of the world goes back a very long time; traces have been found before the pre-Roman era in locations connected to the Celts. The history of beer in the nation of the Belgae is well documented from the Gallo-Roman era (3rd-4th century AD) when brewing was very much a women's craft. Traces of domestic brewing activity have been found in the remains of Roman villas in Ronchinne, Anth√©e, and Mette. In the Middle Ages, Gruut or Gruit was a fundamental part of the brewing process. This is reflected in family names like Gruuthuse, of the Gruuthusemuseum in Bruges. In abbeys, the quality of beer was improved by adding hops. Hops were gradually used more often as brewers discovered they prevented the beer from souring. The German abbess Hildegard von Bingen provided a detailed description of the workings of hops in the 12th century. Others took different brewing paths. In the Pajottenland region, beers were brewed using wild yeasts and a spontaneous fermentation process, a process particular to the valley of the Zenne, which resulted in Lambic type beers. As in the rest of Europe, beer was seen as a healthy alternative to water. It is estimated daily beer consumption in medieval Europe reached as much as 1.5L per capita. During the reign of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor‚Äîand later under Napoleon‚Äîmost abbeys and nunneries were abolished, and the brewing cauldrons disappeared. Now one can only find authentic brewing monks within the Trappist orders, of which six are found in Belgium. In contrast to abbey beers, Trappist beers are only brewed within the walls of the abbey.

Mason is best remembered today for the film versions of his novels Fire Over England and The Four Feathers; 'Morrice Buckler' was his second novel and its success allowed him to become a full- time writer.

Morrice, the narrator, is a student in the Dutch city of Leyden when first met, although the novel is primarily set in the Austrian Tyrol and England in the aftermath of Monmouth's 1685 rebellion. An old friend is executed for sheltering two Monmouth rebels after being betrayed by a villainous foreigner, Count Lukstein; Morrice travels to Austria where he kills the Count in a midnight duel on his wedding night. The rest of the story concerns his relationship with the Count's beautiful widow, who seeks revenge for her husband's death; despite this unpromising start, Morrice finally wins her hand, although the Introduction to the story, set 20 years later, suggests she has since died.

In addition to its role aboard warships of the Imperial German Navy, it was also used as a shore based anti-aircraft gun and coastal artillery during the First World War. The Belgians obtained a number of these guns either when the Germans retreated or as reparations following Germany's defeat during the First World War. The barrels were lined down to 75 mm by the Fonderie Royale des Canons (FRC) in 1927. The guns were given a muzzle break and mounted on a shielded, high angle mount on either a dual-axle flatbed road carriage or on a railroad flatcar.

On September 6, 2017, after more than 12 hours of heated debate, the Parliament of Catalonia passed the law with 72 votes in favor from the pro-independence ruling coalition JxS√≠ and CUP-CC; the opposition party CSQP abstained (10 votes) and other 52 opposition parliamentarians left the chamber before the votes were cast. Even though the laws were public weeks before, the vote didn't appear on the day's agenda until the very last minute to avoid the Spanish Constitutional Court banning it. Some opposition parties accused the regional body's top speaker, Carme Forcadell, of fast-tracking the law through parliament by altering the day's agenda to introduce the issue, not allowing them to appeal the law before being put up to vote. Members from JxS√≠ acknowledged it was not their preferred method, but justified it in that it was the only way to get the bill on the floor without being blocked and that it was not \\"any ordinary law\\". Some months later the Spanish Constitutional Court endorsed the reform of the Parliament regulation that allowed passing the law. It was suspended on September 7 by the Constitutional Court after accepting an appeal from the Spanish government.

In 2005 the firm launched Marmol Radziner Prefab to address sustainable construction. Its work received design honors for both architectural and industrial design, including an International Design Excellence Award (IDEA), sponsored by BusinessWeek. By 2015, the company had five prefab designs, \\"for about $200 per square foot\\".Penelope Green, \\"Designer House Kit Puts Fab in Prefab\\", Star Tribune (December 27, 2015), p. H1, H2. In 2007, it was critically lauded for the restoration of Richard Neutra's Kaufmann Desert House. In 2009, the firm debuted Marmol Radziner Jewelry, a handmade collection produced in the firm‚Äôs metal shop. Radziner's wife, Robin Cottle, who had received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the California Institute of the Arts, proposed to have that department make other pieces, which the company began selling commercially, with Cottle as the lead designer. In 2012, The Hollywood Reporter named the firm one of the 25 \\"most influential interior designers in L.A.\\", describing them as \\"[m]asters of creating clean, modern environments coupled with a timeless aesthetic\\". In 2016, the same source listed them as one of the \\"10 hottest architects changing L.A. real estate\\".

The architects designed an addition \\"cantilevered from the front so it wouldn't block the prized views of oaks and sycamores\\". In 2009, cinematographer Robert Richardson employed the firm to renovate his L.A. West Side house, set in a wooded valley and originally designed by Cliff May in 1952. Marmol Radziner was selected for their \\"wide experience restoring midcentury jewels\\", and the rebuild aimed to \\"soften the house\\" in order to complement its natural surroundings, and to \\"avoid distracting from the drama\\" of nature \\"by focusing attention on the house's strengths\\". Fashion designer Tom Ford brought in the firm to remodel the Holmby Hills estate of Betsy Bloomingdale. They also implemented the design of architect Tadao Ando for the buildings on Ford's ranch, a 20,662-acre Cerro Pelon Ranch estate in the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico, for which the firm was \\"responsible for the entire property's construction\\" including several houses and a ranch manager's headquarters with a detached office building and additional horse facilities.

It was edited by Ford's longtime collaborator Robert Parrish. Undercover was Ford's only sound film acting role, and was the first film ever produced by an intelligence service to train its agents. The film, which is in the public domain, is now widely available online since it was declassified after the war, and it often goes unmentioned in Ford filmographies. Background Ford was commissioned a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Naval Reserves in 1934, and in 1940 he began bringing together thirty other experienced filmmakers in a Naval Reserve unit. He reported for active duty in September 1941. John Ford in Undercover Although he remained officially assigned to the Navy, in October 1941, Ford's unit became part of the Office of Coordinator of Information, the OSS's predecessor. After the OSS was established in 1942, the unit became the OSS Field Photographic Branch. (The OSS was dismantled after the war and was succeeded by the Central Intelligence Agency.) Ford initially was assigned to make documentary films for release to the public. Among them were The Battle of Midway, and December 7th: The Movie, both of which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The two films, like Undercover, were edited by Robert Parrish, who had worked with Ford on Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and other films. The Field Photographic Branch was later tasked with documenting OSS wartime activities and producing training films for its personnel. Hundreds of OSS training films were produced, and were an integral part of the curriculum for agents before being sent into the field. Ford's OSS training films instructed OSS agents in equipment and techniques they would be using in the field. Among them were Training Group (1942) and The Mole (1943), both of which, like Undercover, were declassified after the war and are in the public domain.  The film  Undercover: How to Operate Behind Enemy Lines Undercover is a docudrama that dramatizes the experiences of OSS agents to teach them the right and wrong way of comporting themselves in the field. It is structured as a film within a film. Introduced by Col. Henson L.Robinson, chief of the OSS Division of Schools and Training, it begins by giving examples of agents discovered because of carelessness, and goes on to describe proper agent attitude, the importance of study, and methods of infiltrating enemy territory. Most of the film tells the story of two recruits, one of whom is an overconfident agent known as \\"Student Charlie\\" and the other is \\"Student Al,\\" a studious, careful agent. Germany is the obvious target of their activities but is not mentioned by name, with locales referred to as \\"Enemytown\\" and \\"The Capital.\\" While Al carefully prepares, Charlie does not. As a result, Al winds up smoothly adapting to his assignment while Charlie gets into serious trouble. Charlie unwisely flirts with a jealous sailor's girlfriend None of the actors or crew members involved in the film received on-screen credit. However, Ford is easily identifiable as \\"J.P. Baldwin, Attorney at Law,\\" the civilian cover of an OSS officer, puffing on a pipe and with a large handkerchief in his breast pocket. In her book The Westerns and War Films of John Ford, author Sue Matheson says that \\"watching the film, it is difficult to determine where Ford the director and Ford the OSS man begin and end.\\" His character stresses the importance of teamwork, which is important to film crews as well as OSS operatives. Though produced for educational purposes, the film has creative touches not often seen in military training films, with attention paid to camera angles and movement. Scenes are crosscut to move the story along. Vice Admiral John D. Bulkeley said in an interview after the war that Ford \\"went through the whole monkey business\\" portraying an OSS agent under civilian cover, and that \\"he loved to do that.\\"  Recent showings  The film has been shown on Turner Classic Movies and was made available on Netflix in 2017, and is available online as a public domain film at the Internet Archive and other sites.

The Reverend William Henry Webster (1 October 1850 ‚Äì 1931) was born at Upton Hall, Cheshire. After a brief career in the navy, during which he saw service in Asia, Webster studied to become a priest and followed this vocation to his retirement. Rev. Webster married Mary Stubbs, the niece of the late Dr. Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, in August 1875. They had a family of five children. Webster died in 1931, at Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire, England. While posted in New Zealand he became interested in sea- shells and established a reputation as a Malacologist (the study of molluscs) and conchologist (the study of sea-shells). Several New Zealand molluscs are named after him and a collection of his shells can be found in the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The Websters of Upton In 1798, John Webster, a farmer, bought the Upton manor house, Upton Hall, and title \\"Lord of the Manor\\". He was subsequently known Squire. His son William was a philanthropist and was widely popular. William's father married Elizabeth Matthews, ca. 1845, but she died sometime before 1861. The census of that year shows William married to Sophia Elizabeth Curme. However William senior's eldest son, John Egerton Webster (William Henry's uncle) was not well liked. Having a fortune of some ¬£8-9000 he married a young woman and they lived off the interest, but by 1843 he petitioned for insolvency, which could have landed him in prison.Liverpool Mercury (Liverpool, England), Friday, 27 June 1834, Issue 1208 In the 1851 census it is the younger brother, William, William Henry's father who lives at Upton with his family. In 1861 John's wife took the extraordinary step of divorcing him on the grounds of cruelty.Liverpool Mercury, 15 May 1862. John Egerton is shown by the 1871 census to be an inmate of a poor house in Norwich, England. The family sold Upton Hall in 1862, possibly to pay John Egerton's debts or possibly because the scandal has negatively impacted their social standing. This perhaps explains why William's son, William Henry joined the navy in 1864. He needed an income but his family could not provide him one.  Naval career  Webster joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in 1864 (aged 14).

The site has been protected as a National Historic Site since 1982. It was also referred to as History The actual date of Iwakiri Castle‚Äôs foundation is unknown; however, it is said to have been founded by the Isawa clan in the 14th century. The Isawa claimed descent from the Fujiwara clan and served as retainers of Minamoto no Yoritomo in the region after the destruction of the Northern Fujiwara at Hiraizumi. The Isawa clan later changed their surname to the Rusu clan and ruled the area for the Kamakura shogunate from Taga Castle. During the Nanboku-cho period, the Rusu sided with the Southern Court and pledged fealty to the Chinjufu sh≈çgun Kitabatake Akiie. However, after the establishment of the Muromachi shogunate and the retreat of the Southern Court to Yoshino, the Rusu but later switched sides to support the Northern Court and became retainers of Hatakeyama Tadakuni. The castle was attacked by Kira Sadaie during the Kann≈ç disturbance and the Rusu clan was defeated. After the defeat of Ashikaga Tadayoshi, the clan‚Äôs fortunes were revived, but this time as retainers of the Osaki clan. Into the Sengoku period, the Osaki clan was gradually eclipsed by the Date clan. By the year 1500, the Rusu clan became retainers of the Date, and a Masakage, a son of Date Harumune, was adopted by the Rusu clan as their chieftain. In 1569, Rusu Masakage moved his seat from Iwakiri to nearby Rifu Castle, after having suppressed a local rebellion by the Muraoka clan. Rusu Masakage went on to become one of Date Masamune‚Äôs senior generals, and was eventually given a fief at Mizusawa Castle, where the clan remained until the end of the Edo period. However, after the move from Iwakiri to Rifu, Iwakiri Castle was abandoned and fell slowly into ruin. Description The castle was located one ri west of Taga Castle, the provincial capital of Mutsu Province. Located near the ≈åsh≈´ Kaid≈ç and the junction of the Nanakita River with the Sunaoishi River, it was well sited to control communications between Taga Castle and its hinterland. Iwakiri Castle was a mountain castle, with a total area approximately 600 meters long and 400 meters wide, but divided into several oblong-shaped enclosures along an \\"M\\" shaped ridge on the slopes of the 106 meter tall Mount Takamori. The Inner bailey is roughly 20 meters by 80 meters in size, with secondary enclosures both above and below with dry moats. All of these enclosures have earthen ramparts. The eastern bailey is the larger enclosure, measuring approximately 80 meters in diameter, and housed the main residential area of the castle. It was also surrounded by ramparts and dry moats. Along the western line is a gentle slope up the hillside, with many small enclosures separated by dry moats and clay walls to prevent intrusion by an enemy. Today, the site is named Takamoriyama Park, and only a few fragments of the ramparts remain. It is located within a prefectural forest and is famous for its cherry blossoms. The site of the castle is about two kilometers northwest of Iwakiri Station on the JR East T≈çhoku Main Line.

There is a transitory summer population of scientists and support staff who reach Rothera either by ship or through use of a de Havilland Canada Dash 7 aircraft flying from the Falkland Islands. From its inception until the 1991/1992 summer season BAS Twin Otter aircraft used the skiway above the station on Wormald Ice Piedmont. With the commissioning of the gravel runway and hangar in 1991/1992 air operations became more reliable and access to Rothera was greatly improved through a direct airlink from the Falkland Islands. The Twin Otters mainly fly south of Rothera, via a network of fuel depots, most of which are manned. Heading south of Rothera, the first stop would be Fossil Bluff, then Sky Blu. The Dash 7 will make approximately 20 flights a season to Stanley during the summer, bringing in scientists, support staff, food and equipment. When not tasked for these flights, the Dash can fly to Sky Blu in one hop, landing on the Blue Ice runway, significantly enhancing the range of the Twin Otters by depositing fuel and equipment in much larger quantities.

Biography Alba started studying the piano in a young age, with her elder brother, and that defined her Profession. She continued to learn the piano and she was able to perform very complex compositions compared to her age, which made her a special piano player. Alba went to \\"The English school of Mrs. Miller\\" and then to the \\"French School of Mlle. Edges\\"; she continued her studies in English and French with the help of her father; she showed interest in literature of different writers, specially William Shakespeare. After completing her higher education, she continued her piano studies with the maestro Carlos J. Meneses who presented her in some recitals. When the master Meneses returned to the National Conservatory, from which it had separated previously, Alba enrolled in the conservatory as well, and continued her classes with him. She also attended the classes of Alberto Villase√±or, her cousin Pedro Luis Ogazon and Ricardo Castro who was the Directorate of the Conservatory at that time. Ricardo Castro frequently changed the piano teachers because of circumstances beyond his control, but this did not prejudice Alba's ability to carry out her studies. At the end of her piano career at the National Conservatory of Music in 1908, she traveled to New York City and obtained the \\"B certificate\\" from the 'Virgil Academy' and she received congratulations from her teacher, Mr. A. K. Virgil. Considering herself apt to instruct her compatriots, she began teaching music and piano shortly after her return to Mexico following the 'Virgil System'. In 1910, during his second visit to Mexico, Josef Hofmann asked Alba to translate his book \\"La Execuci√≥n Pian√≠stica\\", a task that she subsequently carried out. Without abandoning the musical-pianist art, in 1917, she published her book \\"The Musical Art in Mexico\\", in which she summarized the musical movement in Mexico until that year. Later she carried out diverse concerts, some with the National Classic Quartet and others. In 1919, for the first time in Mexico, Alba Herrera y Ogaz√≥n with Julian Carrillo played the \\"Sonatas of Beethoven\\". Later she undertook a tour in the republic in company with Juli√°n Carrillo the director of the National Symphony Orchestra, and Sante Lo Priore, an Italian violinist. After she finished her tour in the republic, she published her book \\"Points of View\\", that consisted of critic essays in music; the book was circulated in 1921. She then started the preparation of several other books: Mosaicos Musicales, Greorge Eliot, My Miserable Hours and General History of Music. As a lecturer Alba Herrera y Ogaz√≥n participated effectively in the celebration of the centenary of Beethoven, in the conference that was dictated to music, during the time of the romanticism; and was a speaker in the speeches of the inauguration of the Faculty of Music and anniversary, also she taught classes of musical history. As a journalist, Alba collaborated actively with the Time, The Illustrated World, The Journal, The Tribune, Magazine of Magazines, Pegasus, El Globo, El Universal Ilustrado, El Universal, and others. She also occasionally collaborated with \\"Exc√©lsior\\", \\"Get to Know Mexico\\", \\"La Opini√≥n\\", \\"Mexican Herald\\", \\"Conservatorio\\", \\"Tricolor\\" Sombra \\",\\" Cosmos \\",\\" New Democracy \\"(New York) etc., and she was a member of following corporations: Ateneo de M√©xico , Society of Local History Studies of Mexico City, Ateneo Hisp√°nico, PEN Grupo Ariel, Sociedad Pro Arte Patrio, International League of Iberian and Hispanic American Women, and the International Society of Pianoforte Teachers and Players, also held the following positions: lecturer in the former department of aesthetic culture of the Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico), during 1922 to 1927; professor of piano and history of the music, in the National Conservatory and in the faculty of music of the National University of Mexico, independent until its death.

Coming from a naval family, Purvis first saw action in small ships during the American Revolutionary War, later commanding a ship of the line with the Mediterranean Fleet during 1793-1796. During this period he fought in several significant battles against the French. He then served with the Channel Fleet operating at the blockade of Brest and in the Napoleonic Wars was promoted and tasked with maintaining the blockade of Cadiz. After the outbreak of the Peninsular War, Purvis was active in preventing the French capture of Cadiz and at one stage destroyed the city's seaward defences. He retired post-war to his home in Hampshire. Life Purvis was born into a prominent naval family on 13 March 1747, the second son of George Purvis, the secretary to the Sick and Wounded Board, and his wife Mary Oadham. He was the grandson of Captain George Purvis of Darsham, Suffolk, MP for Aldeburgh and comptroller of the navy in the 1730s. He was the brother of Captain Richard Purvis who died in May 1802, and of George Purvis, who served as secretary to Admiral Lord Howe and later to Admiral the Earl of St. Vincent in the Mediterranean. Purvis joined the Royal Navy at a young age, and by 1778 he was a lieutenant on first and then during the American Revolutionary War. In 1782 he was promoted to commander and sailed off Cape Henry in the 16-gun HMS Duc de Chartres. On 19 August Purvis encountered the 22-gun corvette Aigle, capturing the French ship after a fierce engagement. For this victory, he was promoted to Post Captain, although the end of the war soon afterwards limited his opportunities for service. He was recalled at the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 and give command of first the frigate and then the flagship of Rear-Admiral Samuel Goodall, , in which he sailed for the Mediterranean. Princess Royal was heavily engaged at the Siege of Toulon later in the year, and following the withdrawal Purvis assisted the British forces during the invasion of Corsica, seeing action at the Siege of Bastia and the Siege of Calvi. The following year he was with the fleet which fought at the Battle of Genoa and Battle of the Hy√®res Islands and inflicted minor defeats on the French Mediterranean Fleet during the blockade of Toulon. At the withdrawal from the Mediterranean in late 1796, Princess Royal was paid off and Purvis given command of the 98-gun ship of the line with the Channel Fleet, serving at the blockade of Brest. In 1801 he moved to the 100-gun and briefly returned to shore at the Peace of Amiens. In 1803 he returned to service once more in the Napoleonic Wars, and spent a year in command of until promoted to Rear-Admiral in 1804. In 1806 in this position he was sent to serve with the Mediterranean Fleet once more, commanding the blockade of the Spanish port of Cadiz. Following the outbreak of the Peninsular War in 1808, Purvis led his squadron into Cadiz harbour to secure the Spanish fleet from capture by the advancing French and at one point deliberately destroyed the seaward defences of the port when it seemed likely that the French would overwhelm the landward defences. Ultimately however the French were unable to take the city. Purvis was present at Cadiz in 1810, when a storm blew several Spanish and Portuguese ships ashore where they were destroyed by French artillery fire. Purvis later retired ashore and became a Commissioner of the Navy Board. He married twice, first in 1790 with one son; his wife died in 1798. Secondly he married Elizabeth Dickson, daughter of Sir Archibald Dickson, who survived him. He was promoted to Admiral of the Blue, and died at home at Lymington, Hampshire in the summer of 1825.New Monthly Magazine, Admiral John Child Purvis Notes References * Retrieved on 4 October 2017 1825 deaths Royal Navy admirals Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War ","title":"John Child Purvis"},{"id":"55190326","text":"Hannah R. Cope Plimpton, A woman of the century (page 585 crop) Hannah Rebecca Cope Plimpton (June 19, 1841 - July 7, 1929 in Chicago, Illinois) was a Woman's Relief Corps worker. Early life Hannah Rebecca Cope was born in Hanover, Ohio, on June 18, 1841. She was in a direct line of descendants from Oliver Cope, a Quaker, who came to America with William Penn in 1662. Her father, Nathan Cope, and mother, Elizabeth B. Taylor, were reared in West Chester, Pennsylvania. After their marriage, in 1833, they emigrated to the \\"Far West,\\" to Columbiana County, Ohio, where their daughter Hannah was born, in the town of Hanover, Ohio. In 1856 the Copes moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to give their children better educational advantages. Career In a few years after the moving to Cincinnati, Hannah Cope became one of the teachers in the public schools of that city, teaching for four years in Mount Auburn. It was during that time, in the spring of 1862, after the Battle of Shiloh, when the wounded soldiers were sent up the Ohio river to Cincinnati, and a call was made for volunteers to help take care of them, that she, with her mother, responded and did what they could in ministering to the needs of the sick and afflicted ones, providing many delicacies and such things as were needed in a hastily-improvised hospital. Finally the old orphan asylum was secured and fitted up as comfortably as possible, and called the Washington Park Military Hospital. Many of the convalescent soldiers were entertained in the home of Cope. She always took an active part in church and temperance work, having served as treasurer and secretary in various societies, and as secretary of the local Woman's Christian Temperance Union for fifteen years. At the institution of John A. Logan Corps, No. 56, in March 1885, in Denison, with Mrs. McHenry as its president, Plimpton was her secretary. The following year Mrs McHenry was elected department president, and Plimpton served as department secretary. The next year she was department instituting and installing officer, and in 1889. during Mrs. Stocking's administration as department president of Iowa, she was department secretary, working again with Mrs. McHenry, who was department treasurer. In December 1889, Mrs. McHenry was elected conductor of John A. Logan Corps No. 56, and Plimpton was her assistant. They both served in that capacity until the National convention, held in Boston, on August 5, 1890, when she was appointed national secretary of the Woman's Relief Corps. In the fall of 1891 she was elected matron of the National Woman's Relief Corps Home, in Madison, Ohio. Personal life After the close of the war, on August 29, 1865, Hannah Cope became the wife of Silas Wheelock Plimpton, jr. (1838-1927), of Providence, Rhode Island, and moved to Caldwell County, Missouri, residing there nine years, and moving from there to her home in Denison, Iowa. She had two children: Lois Elizabeth Plimpton (b. 1869) and Nathan Cope Plimpton (b. 1873). They moved to Chicago and lived at 6027 University Avenue. Her husband died in Chicago, on October 6, 1927.

Bangall has a post office with ZIP code 12506, which opened on August 8, 1851. History Bangall lies in the Town of Stanford, which was created from the Town of Washington in 1793. According to local lore, the hamlet's name derives from a Yankee tinker passing through the settlement who was harassed by some youths who went so far as to strike the tinker's horse in the head, killing it. To this the tinker is supposed to have responded, \\"Well, this does bang all!\\" A phrase that circulated until it stuck.Smith, James Hadden, History of Dutchess County with Illustrations and Biographical Sketch, p.295, Syracuse, D. Mason & Co., 1882 Among the early settlers were the Sutherlands, who are recorded in 1815. Early mills were powered by water from the Hunns Lake Creek, a tributary of the Wappingers Creek. The First Baptist Church was established in 1755, the members having emigrated from Massachusetts. Elder Comer Bullock rode a circuit that included Rhinebeck, Kinderhook, Hudson, Oswego, and a number of other places. In 1867, surveyors for the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad discovered that the line would go through the church. The railroad then made a donation sufficient to allow the congregation to build a new church about half a mile south of the original. The Second Baptist Church was founded in 1860. The Methodist Episcopal Church, erected in 1843, was established largely through the generosity of Leonard Winans, who donated the lumber, much of it hauled from Poughkeepsie. He also provided free board to the carpenters. Until about 1860 it was a joint pastorate with the church in Pine Plains, when it became a shared pastorate with the church in Milan. The postmaster during President Lincoln's first term was John Bullis. The hamlet of Bangall developed as a railroad stop on the Dutchess and Columbia Railroad, which ran from Dutchess Junction to the Connecticut state line. Thus, the hamlet was a source of goods and supplies for the farmers in the surrounding area.

Men and women pray together unlike in other mosques while face- covering veils such as burqas and niqab were banned on the premises as such garments are by Ate≈ü considered political statements rather than religious clothing. This caused outrage in the Muslim world and the founder of the mosque received hundreds of death threats from Muslims across the world. The legal department of Al-Azhar University in Egypt issued a fatwa against the mosque along with all other liberal mosques.  Netherlands   Russia   Ittifaq al-Muslimin   Jadid  The Jadids were Muslim modernist reformers within the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th century. They normally referred to themselves by the Turkic terms Taraqqiparvarlar ('progressives'), Ziyalilar ('intellectuals'), or simply Y√§≈ül√§r/Yoshlar ('youth').Khalid (1998), p. 93. Jadids maintained that Muslims in the Russian Empire had entered a period of decay that could only be rectified by the acquisition of a new kind of knowledge and modernist, European-modeled cultural reform. Although there were substantial ideological differences within the movement, Jadids were marked by their widespread use of print media in promoting their messages and advocacy of the usul ul-jadid or \\"new method\\" of teaching in the maktabs of the empire, from which the term Jadidism is derived. A leading figure in the efforts to reform education was the Crimean Tatar Ismail Gasprinski who lived from 1851‚Äì1914. Intellectuals such as Mahmud Khoja (author of the famous play \\"The Patricide\\" and founder of one of Turkestan's first Jadid schools) carried Gaspirali's ideas back to Central Asia.Khalid (1998), p. 80.

The organisation was founded and is chaired by Farmida Bi, an expert in Islamic Finance to provide a voice for progressive Muslims who she felt were unrepresented by existing faith organisations.  British Muslims for Secular Democracy  Founded in 2006, British Muslims for Secular Democracy is a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to supporting secularism in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 2006 by Nasreen Rehman and Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. The group believes the diversity of views among British Muslims is not adequately represented to wider British society and that their image is distorted. The organization is one of the growing number of feminist and progressive Muslim organizations.  Quilliam  Quilliam is a London-based left-of-center think tank founded in 2008, that focuses on counter-extremism, specifically against Islamism, which it argues represents a desire to impose a given interpretation of Islam on society. Founded as The Quilliam Foundation, it lobbies government and public institutions for more nuanced policies regarding Islam and on the need for greater democracy in the Muslim world whilst empowering moderate Muslim voices. According to one of its co-founders, Maajid Nawaz, \\"We wish to raise Islamism\\"; he also said, \\"I want to demonstrate how the Islamist ideology is incompatible with Islam. Secondly ‚Ä¶ develop a Western Islam that is at home in Britain and in Europe ‚Ä¶ reverse radicalisation by taking on their arguments and countering them.\\" The organisation opposes any Islamist ideology and champions freedom of expression. The critique of Islamist ideology by its founders, Maajid Usman Nawaz, Rashad Zaman Ali and Ed Husain, is based, in part, on their personal experiences.Nawaz, Maajid. Radical. W.H. Allen, London: 2012 Maajid Nawaz at West Hampstead, London hustings 2015 Co-founder Maajid Nawaz is a British activist, author, columnist, radio host and politician. He was the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for London's Hampstead and Kilburn constituency in the 2015 general election. Nawaz is a former member of the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir. This association led to his arrest in Egypt in December 2001, where he remained imprisoned until 2006. Reading books on human rights and interacting with Amnesty International, which adopted him as a prisoner of conscience, resulted in a change of heart. This led Nawaz to leave Hizb-ut-Tahrir in 2007, renounce his Islamist past and call for a \\"Secular Islam\\". He wrote an autobiography, Radical, which was published in 2012. Since then, he has become a prominent critic of Islamism in the United Kingdom. He is a regular op-ed contributor, debater and public commenter. He presented his views on radicalisation in front of US Senate Committee and UK Home Affairs Committee in their respective inquiries on the roots of radical extremism. His writings have been published in various international newspapers and has delivered lectures at LSE and University of Liverpool, and has given talks at UK Defence Academy and Marshall Center for Security Studies. Nawaz argues that society must build a competing brand by adhering to its own values and visibly distinguishing its actions from those of the extremists. He warned against the illiberal approach of seeking new powers to intercept communications, or banning non-violent groups, and asserted that liberalism will kill totalitarianism softly, not by mimicking it. He advocates a civil society push back against extremism, just like it was done against racism and homophobia, by seeding grass-roots initiatives and making extremist narratives a taboo. In Nawaz's view, society is moving from an era of Nation-States and Globalisation, where identity is defined by national allegiances and citizenship, to an \\"Age of Behaviour\\" where behaviour is shaped by transnational ideas, narratives and allegiances. Nawaz notes how all transnational social movements of today, whether European Neo-fascism or Islamism, are extremist in nature, and democracy aspirants all over the world are left behind. He criticises the idea of political correctness, and the hesitation of democrats in asserting the universality of democratic norms. He also points to the political failure of many states in the Muslim world as a contributing factor. According to him, there is absence of democratic choice in many Muslim-majority countries, which means that their democratic parties often find themselves competing with non-democratic parties, including theocratic and military-backed ones. The political failure of democratic parties is taken as a failure of democracy itself in the Muslim world. According to Nawaz, all social movements are made up of some basic elements, and to challenge any movement, its elements have to be replaced with better alternatives. The four elements are: * Ideas: Idea is the cause in which one believes e.g. the establishment of a global caliphate. * Narratives: Narrative is the propaganda technique employed to sell that idea e.g. the narrative of West being at war with Islam. * Symbols: Symbols denote iconography, flags, the logos, attires, congregations etc. * Leaders: Leaders are the people that come to symbolise what the struggle means. As a solution, Nawaz suggests building of global youth-led democratic movements that are above politics, and that build demand for democracy at the civilisational level. He notes that while Islamists offer a full package to the Muslim youth, the democrats of the Muslim world offer nothing: there is nothing to dream, no democratic leaders to follow and no democratic symbolism to admire. He cites Malala Yousafzai as a successful symbol of democracy and women's rights, but stresses the need for more such symbols which young Muslims can look up to. In his essay On Blasphemy, Nawaz notes that all prophets and reformers blasphemed against the existing orders of their time, and that heresy is the only guarantee of progress. He lamented the revival of the atmosphere of blasphemy, and the neo- orientalist unwillingness to defend the ideals of free speech. He also criticised the term Islamophobia which, according to him, is a muzzle on free speech and deployed as a shield against genuine criticism.  Inclusive Mosque Initiative  The Inclusive Mosque Initiative (commonly known as IMI) was founded in 2012, in London, UK. It is a grassroots activist organization which works toward ‚ÄòEstablishing a place of worship for the promotion and practice of an inclusive Islam.‚Äô Since its inception the organisation has spread rapidly, with chapters across the UK and IMI internationally (Malaysia, Kashmir, Pakistan and Zurich). The London group remains the most active of IMI sites, and is structured around a majlis or committee of volunteers who share the everyday running of the organisation. The beginning of IMI came out of their frustrations with the situation for women in many British mosques, where often women‚Äôs sections do not exist and ‚Äò[s]ometimes the facilities for women are very inferior, cramped, and not at all conducive to the attitude of worship.‚Äô Relatedly, and thematically linking both the above channels of influence is the work of progressive, feminist and liberationist scholars rereading primarily Islamic sources in practice-based ways, such as Wadud‚Äôs canonical work and activist endeavours on gender equality, and Asra Nomani‚Äôs ‚ÄòIslamic Bill of Rights for Women‚Äô.A History of Women in Islam, By Jamal Khawaja IMI provides a space where families can pray together and at times are led by women. In all circumstances, regardless of the madhab of salah or who's leading, there is no compulsion for attendants to join in salah.*Men and women praying together in mosques*Women promote mosques ‚Äòfor all‚Äô in Britain Inclusive Mosque Initiative is intentionally inclusive and welcomes everyone who is interested in its activities. Whilst IMI is not a specifically queer organisation, amongst its social justice campaigns, IMI is openly concerned with the rights and safety of the LGBT community, Imi also works with, and follows, guidance of progressive, liberationist readings of Islam, and welcomes everyone regardless of gender or sexual identities.

Progressive Muslim Union   Secular Islam Summit  The Secular Islam Summit was an international forum for secularists of Islamic societies, held 4‚Äì5 March 2007 in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was largely organized and funded by the Center for Inquiry, a secular humanist educational organization, along with secular Muslims such as Banafsheh Zand-Bonazzi and in partnership with the International Intelligence Summit, a forum on terrorism. The common ground of the participants was the belief that Islam and secular democracy should be compatible. They agreed that Islam must be either a religion or a political philosophy, not both. According to Banafsheh Zand-Bonazzi, one of the organizers, one of the summit's goals was to be a \\"sanctuary\\" for victims of Islamism and a forum for the embrace of secular values.Kuwait News Agency; \\"First \\"Secular Islam Summit\\" to convene early next month in Florida; 27 February 2007 Speakers ranged from former believers to devout reformers, including Ibn Warraq (the pen name of an ex-Muslim author known for criticism of Islam), Tawfik Hamid (an ex-jihadist, now in hiding), Afshin Ellian (an Iranian refugee under police protection), Irshad Manji (a self-described \\"radical traditionalist\\"), Ayaan Hirsi Ali (a former member of the Dutch Parliament), and Hasan Mahmud (director of Shariah at the Muslim Canadian Congress). Several devout Muslims that had been invited to speak, such as Faisal Abdul Rauf and Mike Ghouse, did not attend; one that did, Irshad Manji, criticized the summit for \\"not making stronger overtures to practicing Muslims\\", and urged them to seek common ground.

Although several hundreds were manufactured during development and trials conducted, neither type entered service. Design The device comprised a small upper body with wings and tail, clamped on top of an air-launched torpedo. In operation, it was dropped by an attacking aircraft from a safe altitude and distance, gliding down towards the target vessel and, as it approached the target, a timed fuse opened a small parachute which was attached to the glider body. It continued down and impacted the water a short distance from the target. When the torpedo met the surface of the water, the glider body automatically detached and was pulled back out of the way by the parachute, while the torpedo motor started and drove it to impact its target.

Calomiris from Forbes magazine (accessed December 15, 2018). Early life, education, and career Born in Washington, D.C., his father was businessman William Calomiris, a past president of the Washington Board of Trade and founder of the William Calomiris Investment Corp, who led efforts to create housing for low- and middle-income Washington residents. Charles Calomiris received a B.A. in economics from Yale University and a Ph.D. in economics from Stanford University. Calomiris thereafter served in numerous capacities with organizations addressing economic policy, including serving as a Fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a member of the Shadow Open Market Committee, co-director of the Hoover Institution's Program on Regulation and the Rule of Law, and a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He has advised government entities as a researcher at the Office of Financial Research in the United States Department of the Treasury, and as a member of the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission of the United States Congress. Views Calomiris was critical from the outset of the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a set of financial regulations passed in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Argued that the law doubles down on \\"too big to fail\\" and does not prevent the government from subsidizing mortgage risk, which fueled the crisis. He further cited the law's overly complicated and ambiguously worded provisions, and instead advocated alternative \\"incentive- robust\\" solutions, such as \\"a rule requiring that banks hold cash at the central bank equal to 20% of their assets\\", and \\"a minimum uninsured debt requirement for large banks in the form of subordinated debt\\". In 2018, Calomiris argued in favor of capitalism, noting that many predictions made by Karl Marx have failed to materialize. In a September 2018 conference at Columbia University's Centre on Capitalism and Society, Calomiris argued that the improvement of the U.S. economy since 2016 \\"cannot be reasonably contested\\". Fragile By Design In 2014, Calomiris coauthored, with Stephen Haber, Fragile By Design: The Political Origins of Banking Panics and Scarce Credit. In the book, Calomiris and Haber argue that the problems faced by the banking industry arise from the extensive network of government regulations effectively directing how they do business, including that \\"geographic restrictions on banking made banks too small to weather regional economic shocks\\". The book received various accolades, including an American Publishers 2015 Award for best book in Business, Finance and Management, and being named to best books of the year lists by the Financial Times and Bloomberg Businessweek.

DiSalvo has tied problems in a number of professions to labor unions advocating for priorities that fail to serve public needs, such as police unions defending officers with disciplinary records indicating use of excessive force, and school districts funding pensions for teachers while neglecting students with present needs.Dana Goldstein, \\"Chicago teachers' issues go beyond money\\", Dayton Daily News (October 27, 2019), p.

The first German side to qualify for the UEFA Futsal Cup was UFC Muenster in the 2006-07 season, but they were eliminated in the Preliminary Round with two draws and one loss. Muenster also were the first German side to win a game in that competition with a 3-1 victory over Estonian champions Betoon Tallinn in the 2008-09 season. Four-time German futsal champions Hamburg Panthers were the first German team to reach the Main Round in the 2013-14 season, where they lost all three group games, and the first side to advance to the Elite Round in the 2016-17 season to become one of the 16 best teams in Europe. TV Wackersdorf were the first German team to participate in the Mitropa Futsal Cup in the 2016-17 season, and finished in fourth place with one draw and two losses. In the course of time, Germany has climbed to 29th position in the UEFA coefficient rankings with now 2,084 points.

After the annexation of Burmese kingdom by the British, the Bengali Hindus arrived in British Burma in various capacities. A large section came as white collared executives in the administration, while a smaller proportion came as labourers in various projects. By the 1920s, the Bengali Hindus constituted a thriving community in the urban centres like Rangoon, Mandalay, Moulmein, Bassein and Akyab. Starting with the anti-Indian movements in the late 1930s, the Bengali Hindus began to leave British Burma in hundreds. After the independence and especially the 1962 coup, large numbers of Bengali Hindus left for India. At present, the Bengali Hindu population is concentrated in the cities of Yangon and Sittwe and in the some of the semi-urban and rural areas of Rakhine State. The estimated population quoted in various source range between 10,000 and 56,000. The Bengali Hindus are not recognized as full citizens as per the 1982 law, but are entitled to hold the ID Card for National Verification.  Identity  In Myanmar, the citizenship issue of the Rohingyas has led to identity crisis among the Bengali Hindu population. While the Rohingyas prefer to use the term Rohingya to identify themselves, the Myanmar authorities insist on using the term Bengalis for the Rohingyas. As the Rohingyas are considered as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, the Bengali Hindus in Rakhine State shun the usage of the term Bengali to identify themselves. They prefer to identify themselves as Burmese Hindus. In the recent times, the Bengali Hindus have started wearing small armbands to distinguish themselves from the Rohingya. The Bengali Hindu women have started wearing bindis to distinguish themselves from the Rohingyas.  Persecution  In 1962, after the coup, an estimated 300,000 Indians were forced to leave Burma. The repatriates included a significant number of Bengali Hindus of East Bengal origin. The Bengali Hindu returnees were settled in four camps in Kamarhati, Barasat, Bongaon and Hasnabad, in the 24 Parganas district of West Bengal.

During the following decade, Ferrers was regularly appointed to royal commission within Leicestershire, including those of Array, Oyer and Terminer, and as a Justice of the Peace. He was also summoned to parliament as Henrico de Ferrariis de Groby from the August 1377 parliament to that of December 1387.

Unraced as a two-year-old he showed modest form in 1992 and 1993, winning two minor races in England. After being transferred to race in Dubai he emerged as a top-class middle-distance performer as a five-year-old, taking the second and third rounds of the Al Maktoum Challenge before returning to Europe to win the Magnet Cup, Spreti-Rennen and Irish Champion Stakes. Following an unsuccessful campaign in 1996 he was retired to stud but proved to be infertile. After being gelded he competed in National Hunt races and won one minor race before being retired in 2001. Background Cezzanne was a bay horse bred in England by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud. As a yearling he was acquired by Sheikh Mohammed and was sent into training with Michael Stoute at Freemason Lodge in Newmarket, Suffolk. Cezanne was one of only 35 foals sired by Ajdal, an outstanding sprinter who died at the age of four in 1988 after his first season at stud. His dam Reprocolor won the Lancashire Oaks and became one of Meon Valley's foundation mares: her other descendants have included Colorspin, Izzi Top, Kayf Tara and Opera House. Racing career 1992: three-year-old season On his racecourse debut, Cezanne finished fourth in a maiden race over ten furlongs at Windsor Racecourse on 11 May. Fifteen days later, in a similar event at Sandown Park he recorded his first success, winning by half a length from Scrutineer. In his two subsequent races that season he finished second in a minor race at Leicester in June and then ran unplaced in a handicap race at York in August. 1993: four-year-old season Cezanne began his second season finishing ninth in a handicap at Newbury in May and was then off the course until the autumn. In September he returned to finish sixth at Doncaster and then won a handicap at Pontefract Racecourse, beating the favourite Bold Stroke by one and a half lengths. Five days later he finished second in a similar event at Haydock Park. At the end of the year he was sent to join Sheikh Mohammed's newly established Godolphin racing stable in Dubai where he was trained by Hilal Ibrahim. He made a successful start to his career in Dubai, winning a minor handicap at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse on 26 December. 1994: five-year-old season In January 1994 continued his good form in Dubai, winning races over 2400 metres and 1800 metres. On 13 February he contested the inaugural running of the second round of the Al Maktoum Challenge over 2000 metres at Nad Al Sheba. Ridden by Gary Hind he won by a short head from his stablemate Red Bishop. In the third round of the challenge over 2400 metres twelve days later, with Hind again in the saddle, he recorded another narrow victory with Red Bishop again taking second place. On his returen to Europe Cezanne finished fourth in a handicap at Sandown on 1 July. Eight days later at York he was assigned top weight of 138 pounds and started at odds of 9/2 for the John Smith's Magnet Cup. After being restrained by Hind in the early stages he took the lead in the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by a neck from the three-year-old Midnight Legend (winner of the King George V Stakes). In August the horse finished second to Urgent Request when favourite for the Rose of Lancaster Stakes and was then sent to Germany to contest the Group 3 Spreti-Rennen over 2000 metres at Baden-Baden. After turning into the straight in sith place he took the lead in the closing stages and won by two lengths from Vincenzo. Mick Kinane took over from Hind when Cezanne was stepped up in class for the Group 1 Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 10 September. He was made the 7/2 third choice in the betting behind the joint-favourites Muhtarram and Del Deya (Pretty Polly Stakes) whilst the other five runners were Grand Lodge, Environment Friend, Scribe (Gordon Richards Stakes), Garden of Heaven (Prix du Conseil de Paris) and Perfect Imposter (Tattersalls Gold Cup). Cezanne raced close behind the leaders and moved into second place behind Del Deya half a mile from the finish. He took the lead inside the final furlong and prevailed in a \\"blanket finish\\", winning by a neck, a short head and a neck from Del Deya, Grand Lodge and Muhtarram. For his final run of the season Cezanne was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Classic on the dirt track at Churchill Downs on 5 November and finished ninth of the fourteen runners behind Concern. 1996: seven-year-old season After missing the whole of the 1995 season Ceanne returned as a seven-year-old in 1996 when he was trained by Saeed bin Suroor. Racing in Dubai he contested the Al Maktoum Challenge, finishing fourth to Tamayaz in the first round on 11 February and second to the same horse in the third round on 10 March. In the Dubai Duty Free (then run on dirt) seventeen days later he proved no match for the American challenger Key of Luck but came home second of the fourteen runners. On returning to Europe he ran consistently without ever looking likely to recover his 1994 form. He finished sixth in the Premio Presidente della Repubblica at Milan in May, fifth in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and fourth in the September Stakes at Kempton in September. 1998 -2001: National Hunt career Cezanne was retired from racing and the end of the 1996 season and became a breeding stallion in Ireland. Standing at the Coolagown Stud in County Cork he proved to be infertile and produced no recorded foals. He was gelded in September 1998. In the late autumn of 1998 Cezanne joined the stable of Michael Roberts in Sussex and embarked on a new career as a National Hunt horse. After being beaten in his first two starts over obstacles he won a Novice hurdle race at Huntingdon Racecourse on 12 May 1999. He continued to compete in hurdle races for the next three seasons but never won again and ended his career by finishing unplaced in a handicap hurdle at Wincanton in November 2001.

The episode was first broadcast on September 28, 2017, on NBC, and was watched by 10.2 million people during its original broadcast. It was written by David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, and directed by James Burrows. Airing over 11 years after the original series finale, the episode's intro scene effectively retcons many of the events of the finale out of existence as a daydream Karen experiences. Plot At Will's apartment, Karen awakens from a dream in which Will and Grace married their partners, and had children who married each other. Will and Grace explain that they have no children, that they are both separated from their partners, and that Grace is staying at Will's apartment temporarily while she finalizes her divorce. Will writes an angry letter to Steve Sandoval, a congressman gutting the Environmental Protection Agency, but to whom Will is also secretly attracted. Jack uses his connections to get himself and Will invited to an event held by Sandoval at the White House Rose Garden. Will and Sandoval meet; they flirt with each other, and Sandoval instructs a page to take Will on a tour of the West Wing. Meanwhile, Karen uses her friendship with Melania Trump to get Grace's interior design studio hired to redecorate the Oval Office. Though Grace opposes Trump politically, she accepts the high-paying job. She travels to the White House, where she encounters Will at Sandoval's event. Their hypocritical motivations for being in Washington are exposed, and they have an argument that devolves into a pillow fight in the Oval Office. Back in New York, Grace decides to move out of Will's apartment. Will convinces her to stay, and they reconcile with the agreement that they will keep politics out of their relationship. Karen admonishes Grace for rejecting the opportunity to decorate the Oval Office, but Grace responds that made one change: a \\"Make America Gay Again\\" hat left on top of the President's chair. Ratings and reception \\"11 Years Later\\" was watched by 10.2 million people during its original broadcast, and gained a 3.0 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49.  Kendall Williams of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3 out of 5, saying, \\"The episode doesn‚Äôt venture from its usual shenanigans and social commentary about people and causes that matter. It‚Äôs no mistake that the season premiere refers to the current occupant in The White House, and then temporarily relocates the main characters to D.C. to act out their personal and political prejudices.\\" She also mentioned that \\"some of the intended jokes and jabs didn't hit their mark with me\\", despite enjoying the chemistry between the leading actors. However, she still gave some positive thoughts about the episode, saying \\"Nothing significant has changed on the show, which is a good thing. Viewers would be disoriented if presented with unrealistic scenarios that might come across as forced or angry in order for the writers to prove a point.\\" Justin Kirkland from Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an A‚àí. He particularly praised the political message of the episode, saying, \\"Will & Grace is the best political vehicle when it‚Äôs being absolutely ridiculous, which is why it doesn‚Äôt take long to come back together.\\" He also enjoyed the characters' dynamics and relationships, especially between Will and Grace.

However, he completed this point by saying, \\"If Will and Grace proved two things, it‚Äôs that we have bigger fish to fry, and that sometimes the best way to fight the fight is with something familiar.\\" Jonathan Bernstein from The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 2 out of 5, with a mixed to negative review.

He was educated at Eton College in 1732 and was admitted at Middle Temple in 1741 and at Emmanuel College, Cambridge aged 18 on 28 January 1742. He joined the army in the 1st The Royal Dragoons, being a cornet in 1744, lieutenant in 1746, captain in 1751, major in 1759 and Lieutenant-Colonel in 1761. Burton was returned as Member of Parliament for Eye through his friend Lord Cornwallis at a by-election in 1762. He took name of Phillipson in 1766 under the terms of a will.Deed Poll Office Richard Burton: change of name and arms to Philipson In the 1768 general election Burton Phillipson (as he was now named) unsuccessfully contested Winchelsea on behalf of Arnold Nesbitt. He was then returned as MP for Eye in a by-election in 1770. In 1774 and 1780 he was re- elected for Eye. He grew very deaf and stout as he grew older, factors which do not appear to have hampered his military career. However, in 1784 Lord Cornwallis complained of Phillipson having \\"most provokingly left all his trumpets in London, which is hard upon me in our t√™tes-√†-t√™te\\". Philippson was re-elected MP for Eye in 1784 and 1790. There is no record of his having ever spoken during his 28 years in Parliament. While in Parliament, Phillipson continued his military service and became colonel of the 1st Dragoons in 1775. In 1779 the 20th Light Dragoons (1779) was raised from the light troops of the 3rd Dragoon Guards, 1st Dragoons and 11th Dragoons and Phillipson became Colonel and then Major General of the regiment in 1779. The 20th Regiment was disbanded and Phillipson became colonel in the 3rd Dragoon Guards in 1785 and was made Lieutenant-General in 1787.

Robert Hyde Colebrooke (1762? - 21 September 1808) was a British infantry officer in India who conducted early surveys in Bengal and Mysore before becoming Surveyor General of Bengal, a position he held from 1788 to 1794 succeeding Alexander Kyd. Life and work It is thought that Colebrooke was born in Switzerland. His father Robert Colebrooke (1718 - 1784) was the British ambassador to the Swiss confederacy from 1762 to 1764 and his mother was Mary (n√©e Williams). The father had to sell his property of Chilham Castle in 1774 to pay his creditors. Colebrooke joined the Bengal Infantry in 1778. T.D. Pearse trained and appointed him as Surveyor in 1783. Colebrooke surveyed the distance from Hooghly to Madras using a perambulator. Trained in topographical illustration and surveying he produced \\"Twelve views of places in the kingdom of Mysore\\" in 1794 based on his work in Mysore in 1790. He accompanied Archibald Blair to survey the Andaman Islands in 1789. Colebrooke Island and Passage were named after him. Colebrooke compiled a vocabulary of Andaman islanders in an article to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. He also described the volcanic Barren Island. After Alexander Kyd was moved to the Andamans as Superintendent of the settlement, the position of Surveyor General of Bengal became vacant and Colebrooke was appointed in 1794. He remained in this position he kept until his death from dysentery in 1808 on the way from Rohillakhand to Calcutta at Bhagalpur. Colebrooke was a cousin of the orientalist H.T. Colebrooke. He was promoted to Lieutenant in November 1778, Lt-Colonel in November 1803. Colebrooke took a special interest in the changing course of the Ganges river. One of Colebrooke's suggestions, made in 1795, was that by cutting a 20 foot wide and 15‚Äì20 foot deep canal between the Hurdum and Ichamati to connect the Churni River and the Ganges would make the river navigable for 155 miles and avoid the route through the Sunderbans. The idea was opposed by James Rennell who said: A keen astronomer, Colebrooke also corresponded with John Goldingham at the Madras Observatory to establish the latitude of Calcutta. He was succeeded as Surveyor General by John Garstin.  Personal life Colebrooke married Charlotte Bristowe (died at Bath 2 July 1833) in Calcutta on 31 July 1795 and they had three daughters and two sons (both named Richard, one of whom born 30 December 1800 became an ensign in the Bengal infantry and died on 23 February 1868). As was common in the period, he also had illegitimate children from Indian mistresses. Colebrooke's brother James (1772-18 January 1816) worked in the Madras Infantry.

It modified the 1983 Code of Canon Law to shift responsibility and authority for translations of liturgical texts into modern languages to national and regional conferences of bishops and restrict the role of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments (CDW). It was made public on 9 September and its effective date is 1 October. While directly concerned only with liturgical texts, it represented a significant initiative in the program long advocated by Francis of changing the role of the Roman Curia in the Catholic Church and fostering \\"shared decision-making between local churches and Rome.\\" That he used canon law to achieve his aims demonstrated, in the view of liturgist Rita Ferrone, the intensity of his commitmment to this project. Background For several decades the Catholic Church has increased the use of the vernacular in place of Latin in its liturgies. The Sacred Congregation of Rites, predecessor of the CDW, granted permission for the use of local languages in several countries with expanding missionary activity, including Mandarin Chinese in Mass except for the Canon in 1949 and Hindi in India in 1950. For rituals other than Mass, it gave permission for the use of a French translation in 1948 and a German one in 1951. The Second Vatican Council's Sacrosanctum Concilium, issued by Pope Paul VI on 4 December 1963, discussed the use of the vernacular in the context of the need to enhance lay participation in liturgies. It suggested an increased use of the \\"mother tongue\\" of the congregation and instructed local groups of bishops to consider the role of the vernacular. It \\"opened up the possibility of linguistic change but did not make it mandatory\\". As local groups of bishops and Vatican authorities disputed the quality and nature of translations, the CDW's instruction Liturgiam Authenticam, issued on 28 March 2001 with the approval of Pope John Paul II, ruled that texts \\"insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet.\\" One side in the ongoing debate promoted the philosophy of translation called dynamic equivalence, roughly \\"sense-for-sense\\" translation, rather than the more literal word-for-word translation that John Paul said was required. In the 21st century, Catholic bishops in Germany decided not to work with a commission Pope Benedict XVI erected to guide their translation efforts and then found their own translations rejected by the CDW. French, Italian and Spanish translations were rejected as well. The CDW also dictated much of the work and staffing of the multi-national board, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL), created to produce English translations, which have met with criticism. The bishops of Japan contested the Vatican's right to judge the quality of a translation into Japanese, questioning both the quality of the review and the subsidiary position in which the CDW's review placed them. In December 2016, Pope Francis formed a commission to review the implementation of Liturgiam Authenticam. Headed by Archbishop Arthur Roche, Secretary of the CDW, its membership included bishops from all continents. On 24 August 2017, addressing a conference of Italian liturgists, Francis spoke of the liturgical development since the Second Vatican Council and said: \\"after this long journey, we can affirm with certainty and magisterial authority that the liturgical reform is irreversible\\". Text Francis said he had received the commission's report and considered its recommendations. He outlined the mission of the translation effort: While acknowledging the role Latin continues to play in Catholic liturgy, he expressed confidence that translations could achieve a similar status, that over time \\"vernacular languages themselves [...] would be able to become liturgical languages, standing out in a not dissimilar way to liturgical Latin for their elegance of style and the profundity of their concepts\\". Where the Council fathers spoke of the participation of the laity, Francis wrote of \\"their right to a conscious and active participation in liturgical celebration\\". He recognized the role of the CDW and said that to promote \\"vigilant and creative collaboration full of reciprocal trust\\" between the CDW and conferences of bishops he thought \\"some principles handed on since the time of the [Second Vatican] Council should be more clearly reaffirmed and put into practice\\". Archbishop Roche explained that \\"The object of the changes is to define better the roles of the Apostolic See and the Conferences of Bishops in respect to their proper competencies which are different yet remain complementary.\\" Magnum principium modified two clauses in canon 838 of the Code of Canon Law. Before its modifications the passage at issue read: The revised text read (highlighting in original): The role of the CDW is to review translations rather than authorize them. A note accompanying the release of Magnum principium authored by Archbishop Roche, explained that the CDW was tasked with confirming a translation, that the process \\"leaves responsibility for the translation, presumed to be faithful, to [...] the bishops' conference\\", and \\"presupposes a positive evaluation of the faithfulness and congruence of the produced texts with respect to the Latin text\\". The CDW's role is to ratify the bishop's approval, not to review the translation itself. The CDW still has a role in reviewing \\"adaptations\\", that is, additions to liturgical texts, rather than translations per se. The term adaptations, as used by liturgists, refers to modifications introduced into a liturgy to incorporate or reflect local culture, which can include practices, movement, costume, and music as well as text. The more common term for this undertaking is inculturation. Reactions In The Tablet, Christopher Lamb wrote that \\"This throws open the possibility that the 2011 English Roman Missal‚Äìwhich became mired in disagreement with claims that the Vatican had overly controlled the process‚Äìcould be changed. The onus will now be on local bishops to take the initiative.\\" In America, liturgist John F. Baldovin wrote: \\"those conferences which have been experiencing tension with the Vatican over revised translations, like the French-speaking and German-speaking, now have much more breathing room in deciding what is best for translating liturgical texts\\". Cardinal Blaise Cupich thought Francis was \\"reconnecting the church with the Second Vatican Council\\" by \\"giving in this document an authoritative interpretation of the council as it relates to the responsibilities of bishops for the liturgical life of the church\\". Veteran Vatican journalist John Travis wrote that Magnus principium \\"underscored just how irrelevant the major Roman Curia departments have become under Pope Francis\\", since this involved an extra-curial commission and showed little evidence of input from the CDW. He anticipated \\"a new round of criticism by conservative Catholics who fear that Francis is slowly undoing the legacy of his two predecessors\\". Cardinal Reinhard Marx of Munich-Freising said that German bishops felt \\"great relief\\" and the Episcopal Conference of Germany thanked Francis for underlining the \\"genuine doctrinal authority‚Äù of episcopal conferences.

In 1995, Wada's father ‚Äì an enthusiastic fan of New Zealand rugby and yachting ‚Äì decided to move the family to Burnside, Christchurch in New Zealand. When Wada's parents hired a new piano teacher for her, their chosen instructor also happened to play flute, which was how Wada first took an interest in the instrument.  Career  After earning a Bachelor of Music degree, Wada moved to London, England, to pursue further study at the Trinity College of Music. In 2007, Wada was selected to attend a Swiss summer academy for classical flute held by virtuoso flautist Sir James Galway. Despite being excited at the opportunity, Wada found herself feeling out of place among the other students at the academy, and afterwards began exploring jazz and world music venues. Meeting a group of Cuban musicians, Wada eventually decided to travel to Cuba, where she found a new flute teacher: > \\"I had to relearn everything. After three months, I totally got it. It was > all about the blood flow, the rhythm of the blood. It was about finding a > way of playing the flute that was most natural to me.

In addition to playing flute, she also plays alto and tenor saxophone. In 2009, Wada returned to New Zealand and settled down in Auckland. Soon afterwards, she formed a punk-rock-ska band called Miho Wada and the Shit Fight, and the ensemble toured for the next couple of years. In 2011, she formed the new six- person band Miho's Jazz Orchestra, and the group raised funds for Christchurch earthquake recovery work.

It is sometimes credited as the first personal luxury car. Developed from the Kurtis Sport Car (KSC) that was designed by Frank Kurtis, it was produced and marketed by Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz. The car was powered by one of two V8 engines, either a Cadillac engine or a Lincoln engine, and it was equipped with either a General Motors Hydramatic automatic transmission or a three-speed Borg-Warner manual transmission. The Jet was streamlined, featured numerous luxury appointments, and was equipped with safety features that were not standard on most cars of its day, including a padded dashboard and seat belts. Production of the Muntz Jet occurred in Glendale, California; Evanston, Illinois; and Chicago before ceasing in 1954. The car sold for $5,500 in 1953 (about $51,500 in 2017), but cost $6,500 to produce. In total, Muntz lost approximately $400,000 on the venture. Only 198 Jets were built, an estimated 50 to 130 of which are still in existence. By 2016, fully restored cars had sold for over $100,000 at auction. Author Matt Stone called the Jet \\"one of the fastest and best- performing American cars of the time\\" while Muntz claimed that the 1958 Ford Thunderbird was inspired by his Jet.  Background  The Muntz Jet was built by the Muntz Car Company, which was founded by Elgin, Illinois, native Earl \\"Madman\\" Muntz. Muntz, who was born in 1914 and attended Elgin High School for three semesters before dropping out, had established a prominent reputation selling television sets and other commercial and consumer electronics. Before founding the Muntz Car Company, Muntz had worked successfully as a used-car salesman and at Kaiser-Frazer dealerships in both Los Angeles and New York City, even earning the sobriquet of \\"world's largest car dealer\\". According to automotive journalist Turk Smith, he \\"made and lost several fortunes\\" during his lifetime, and he was married to seven different women.  Design  1950 Muntz Jet in Yountville, California The Muntz Jet was developed from the Kurtis Sport Car (KSC), a two-seat, aluminum-body sports car designed by Frank Kurtis. Muntz bought the rights to the KSC, along with its parts and tooling, from Kurtis Kraft for $200,000. Sam Hanks, who would later win the 1957 Indianapolis 500, contributed to the redesign and re-engineering necessary to create the Muntz. The Jet was built with a solid hardtop. Two different V8 engines were used in the Jet: a Cadillac engine, and a Lincoln engine. The first Jets to be constructed, in Glendale, California, had the Cadillac engine and aluminum bodies, while those built later in Illinois instead had the Lincoln engine and steel bodies. The cars were equipped with General Motors Hydramatic automatic transmissions, while a three-speed Borg-Warner manual transmission was also available as an option. Compared to its Kurtis predecessor, the Jet was heavier but also more agile and capable of a higher top speed, due to its lower drive ratio. The Muntz was heavier than the KSC, weighing almost . Its wheelbase was , longer in both overall length and wheelbase than the Kurtis, which gave it enough room to include a back seat and accommodate four occupants. The Jet stood in height. It was built with body-on-chassis construction and had independent front suspension (A-arms with coil springs) and a live rear axle with leaf springs. It also featured power steering, four-wheel hydraulic brakes, dual exhausts, and a dual coil ignition. In April 1951, Norman Nicholson described the Jet as having \\"the appearance of a streamlined, scaled-down limousine\\". It was available in colors such as boy blue and elephant pink. Similar in appearance to the KSC, the Muntz was more luxuriously appointed than its sports car predecessor. Some of these appointments included an all-leather \\"tuck-and-roll\\" interior, racing-style Stewart-Warner gauges, and a center console with a Muntz radio. A liquor cabinet and ice chest placed under the rear seat armrests were available as an option. The Jet was equipped with safety features that were not standard on most cars of its day, including a padded dashboard and seat belts.  Production and sale  1953 Muntz Jet The first 26 to 40 Muntz Jets were built in Glendale, California. Production was then moved to a factory at 1000 Grey Avenue in Evanston, Illinois, where the car was built roughly between 1949 and 1952. The near cross-country move was necessitated by difficulties related to materials and transportation that plagued the original plant in Glendale. In April 1951, the Muntz Car Company was employing 40 people in its Evanston factory and producing a car a day. In approximately 1952, the company moved plants again, to 2901 North Sheffield Avenue in Chicago's Lake View neighborhood. Production ceased in 1954. In January 1951, the projected cost of a Jet was $5,000. That year, Muntz planned to sell the car out of factory-run showrooms in Houston, Los Angeles, and New York City. With no network of dealers, Muntz Jets were sold to customers directly from the factory. The car sold for $5,500 in 1953, about $51,500 in 2017. At the same time, a Cadillac convertible sold for $3,987, and a comparable Lincoln for $3,600. A single Jet cost roughly $6,500 to produce, $1,000 more than its sticker price. Muntz himself estimated that labor costs alone for each Jet produced totaled $2,000. In total, he lost approximately $400,000 on the venture, and after four years gave up on it. Famous owners of the Jet included Clara Bow, Vic Damone, Grace Kelly, Alfred \\"Lash\\" LaRue, and Mickey Rooney. Six Jets were fitted with a factory-installed \\"hop up\\" kit that included an Edelbrock aluminum intake and twin double-barreled Stromberg carburetors. Muntz Car Company welding chief Peter Condos claimed that two Jets were built with Chrysler FirePower V8 engines.  Performance  Writing in 1951, Norman Nicholson noted a production Muntz Jet had an official top speed of . Muntz himself claimed it could accelerate from 0 to in nine seconds. He also stated that the Jet could reach , but automotive journalist Turk Smith, writing in 1969, expressed doubt that it could even attain .  Legacy  Museo de Historia de la Automoci√≥n in Salamanca In total, 198 Muntz Jets were built. Earlier estimates of 400 cars produced, a figure possibly sourced to Muntz himself, are now thought to be inaccurate. An estimated 50 to 130 of these cars are still in existence. There is no owner's club for the car, although a registry of owners that has accounted for about 125 cars by serial number does exist. Three Jets are owned by the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. By 2002, well restored Jets were selling at auction for $50,000 to $70,000. By 2016, fully restored cars had sold for over $100,000 at auction. In the assessment of Autoweek writer Graham Kozak, while the Jet \\"lacks the cachet of the Tucker...it stands on its own as a well-conceived, well-executed luxury convertible\\". According to author Matt Stone, the Muntz was \\"one of the fastest and best-performing American cars of the time\\". Turk Smith, writing in 1969, opined that a well tuned Jet \\"will still outperform most stock cars of today\\". In 1969, Muntz claimed that the 1958 Ford Thunderbird was inspired by the Jet, and quipped that \\"I was eight years ahead of my time\\" with his car. Thomas E. Bonsall credits the Jet as being the first personal luxury car. In 2000, Daily Herald journalist Jerry Turnquist called it \\"America's first, high performance, four-seat sports car\\". It is also an example of an orphan car. After production of the Jet ended in 1954, Muntz invented and manufactured the 4-track Stereo-Pak tape player, the predecessor of the 8-track tape player. In June 2000, Muntz's childhood home of Elgin celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Muntz Jet with a parade featuring numerous Jets and their owners.

His grand-father Bhawani Das Sethi, a rich businessman, lived in Baidwara in Delhi. His son Jawahar Lal Sethi, father of Arjun Lai, was born of his second wife and was married to Pancho Devi, daughter of Mohan Lai Nazim, who held the rank of District Magistrate of Jaipur. Bhawani Das was friendly with the Mughal princes. His vast business was mainly looked after by his employees, and he, compelled by intuitions to leave Delhi, had later settled at Jaipur. Arjun Lai Sethi earned his B.A. in Persian in 1902. Very well versed in English, Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Pali, and Jain philosophy, he was an excellent writer and poet as. A fluent and impressive speaker on politics and Jain philosophy, he used to speak to the spell-bound audience for hours. He strongly advocated respect for all religions and castes, and the study of Gita. Involvement in India's Freedom Movement From a very young age, he had actively plunged himself into national movements for freedom of India. In 1907, he established Vardhaman Jain Vidyalaya, which became an important center of independence activists. Besides religious education, the students were steeped with revolutionary and political ideology. A Shikshan Samiti, which he established, had its network of Pathshalas in Jaipur. He worked as Kamdar in Jaipur State, but soon left the service, distressed with the behavior of the English with the Indian people. Independence-minded Arjun Lai Sethi answered the call of his heart to serve the country. He was an active participant in revolutionary movements between the years 1905-12. While serving as Head Master of Kalyanmal Mahavidyalaya at Indore, he was arrested and was kept in custody for six years, until 1922, at Jaipur and Vellore.Rajasthan, Gazetteer of India, Volume 26 of Rajasthan, Government Central Press, 1987, p. 54 A large number of daily newspapers from various provinces, and senior leaders had initiated movements for his release. Dr. Annie Besant, among others, met the Viceroy for this purpose. As he had taken a vow not to consume food without worshiping Jain Tirthankar's idol, he fasted in the jail for seventy days,\\"THE XXXII SESSION OF THE INDIAN.

One of his trusted revolutionary cohorts, Moti Chand Jain, from Maharashtra, was sentenced to death. Shri Sethi had married one of the daughters, out of the three sons and three daughters from his wife Gulab Devi, to a young Maharashtrian Brahmin, with the noble idea that the worthy son of that State might possibly follow the same path of martyrdom for his country. His son Prakash was on his death bed in 1923, at the young age of twenty-five. Shri Sethi received a telegram urging him to journey to Jodhpur immediately. Simultaneously, he received a telegram from Pt. Sunder Lal, requesting he travel to Bombay to address a meeting. The bonds of affection could not dissuade his dutiful mind, and he hastened to Bombay. Before the start of his lecture he received the telegram informing him of the death of Prakash. Unperturbed outwardly, he gave his lecture, to the great surprise and mixed sorrow of the large audience which was aware of the sad demise. These are but a few instances of the noble sacrifices of Shri Sethi. Hardships He had truly dedicated his life to the service of his country, plunging his family into great financial difficulties. Senior political leaders, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawahar Lai Nehru, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose consulted him on important matters. Mahatma Gandhi had visited his house on 5 July 1934 to insist on his to re-entry into national movements. He was elected President of Rajputana and Madhya Bharat Congress Committee on Sept 9, 1934, position he did not long hold, due to the divisions within the party.

Gameplay Spellmaker is a fantasy game where a princess has been captured by a dragon, and wizards are competing against each other to rescue the princess. The first wizard to successfully lead the princess to his castle is the winner. The wizard stays in his tower for the entire game and from afar, uses a variety of creatures (giants, princes, dwarves, and frogs) to escort the princess. Combat is resolved with a simple \\"larger creature wins\\", but movement takes place before combat, so a weaker creature can move away from a more powerful creature before combat takes place. Of more importance to victory is the use of magic to create new creatures and move them (and the princess) towards a particular wizard's castle. Reception In the March-April 1979 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 22) Norman S. Howe found the game had problems: \\"Spellmaker is a very exciting game, but much too well-balanced. Whenever one player starts to win the others gang up on him and obliterate his pieces.\\" In the April‚ÄìMay 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 12), Don Turnbull gave the game a below average score of 6 out of 10. Turnbull liked the high quality of the game components, but he also had issues with the four-player game, finding that it was impossible for anyone to win. He concluded, \\"I am in a quandary about a recommendation. Played 'straight', I cannot honestly recommend the game, but it has many entertaining qualities... A pity. Here is an excellent idea, but something went wrong in the works.\\" In the October 1979 edition of Dragon (Issue 30), Bruce Boegman especially liked the game when played by only two players, finding that when three or four players played, there was no room on the board to properly maneuver. \\"This is my only criticism of an excellent game, which provides fine entertainment and can be played in the time that it takes a DM to persuade some obnoxious player that his character really did die.\\" References Board games introduced in 1978 Heritage Models games ","title":"Spellmaker"},{"id":"55191102","text":"Rede Vida (also styled as REDEVIDA) is a Brazilian Catholic television network headquartered in S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto, SP, covering almost all the Brazilian territory through affiliated networks and satellite.

WIL Research was well-known internationally in many disciplines, and considered by many industry experts to be the premier laboratory in the world for developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART). Early History WIL Research Laboratories was founded in 1976 in Cincinnati, Ohio by G. Bruce Briggs, Ralph S. Hodgdon, and Robert W. Brigham, with Dr. Briggs serving as the company's first president. The company was initially a limited mammalian toxicological testing laboratory that conducted short-term studies for several clients in the Cincinnati area. In 1978, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation acquired WIL Research Laboratories. By 1980, WIL Research outgrew its facilities in Cincinnati, subsequently acquired the 75-acre Hess & Clark research facility on the outskirts of Ashland, Ohio, and by 1982 had moved its operations to the new location. The move to Ashland enabled WIL to conduct a larger number of studies as it began to expand its client base.  Sustained Organic Growth  Dr. Joseph F. Holson was named President and Director of WIL Research Laboratories in 1988. Under his leadership over the next 20 years, WIL Research grew from 31 employees into a dynamic contract research organization employing more than 600 individuals at the Ashland site. This success was attributed to the company's entrepreneurial scientific management, study director-centric business model, internationally recognized scientific prowess (particularly in DART), internally developed innovations (including the industry's first protocol-driven toxicology data management software system), and strong involvement in the Ashland community.  Entrepreneurial Scientific Management  During Holson's tenure, WIL Research continuously expanded its scientific capabilities, facilities, and staffing levels. During this period, the company grew from a limited mammalian toxicology research laboratory into a robust interdisciplinary CRO offering developmental and reproductive toxicology, neurotoxicology, inhalation toxicology, developmental neurotoxicology, large animal toxicology, juvenile toxicology, safety pharmacology, metabolism, analytical and bioanalytical chemistry, and formulation services to a globally diverse client base. Underpinning the continuous expansion of service capabilities was a steady expansion of the company's facilities from approximately 30,000 square feet to more than 300,000 square feet of dedicated laboratory, vivarium, and support services space. At the heart of Dr. Holson's vision, though, was a drive to continually deepen the company's talent pool, as the number of employees in Ashland grew from 31 to more than 600. Joseph Holson was well-known as an energetic, outgoing leader with a vision for the company that revolved around the success of his staff and ongoing recruitment efforts. Critical to the success of WIL Research was a continuous investment in staff training, as new biologists typically underwent a 9-12 month training period and all employees regularly completed continuing education not only in their specific areas of expertise but also in the subjects of animal care and welfare, Good Laboratory Practices, and research integrity. Many of the internal training programs developed at WIL Research were highly regarded and requested by clients and industry partners.  Study Director-Centric Business Model  A key driver of WIL's steady growth was its study director-centric business model, which viewed each study director as an individual business unit with scientific, project management, and marketing responsibilities. This approach was in contrast to the typical division within CROs between science and marketing. WIL Research emphasized direct scientist-to-scientist interaction as much as possible across the entire scope of each project, which gained the company numerous accolades from its clients. Examples of the types of projects undertaken by WIL Research included studies of drugs for the treatment of herpes, Alzheimers' disease, glaucoma, cancer, and AIDS, numerous pesticides, and replacement chemicals for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons in fire extinguishers.  Global Leadership in Developmental and Reproductive Toxicology  Although highly respected in many disciplines, WIL Research was considered by many to be the leading laboratory in the world for developmental and reproductive toxicology (DART). This leadership was driven by Dr. Joseph Holson, an internationally recognized authority in the field. The DART division at WIL Research, led initially by Dr. Holson and subsequently by Mr. Mark D. Nemec and Dr. Donald G. Stump, became known not only for high-quality regulatory guideline studies, but also for innovative, specialized DART research.  Internal Innovation  In 1978, as a result of expanding toxicology testing services, the WIL Toxicology Data Management System (WTDMS‚Ñ¢) was developed. This protocol-driven software system was the first in the CRO industry and became the prototype for other major toxicology testing laboratories. WTDMS‚Ñ¢ was licensed to several other toxicology testing laboratories, and was used continuously by WIL Research Laboratories for nearly forty years prior to its gradual replacement by the Provantis system.  Ashland Community  While WIL Research depended on the broader Ashland area for a steady supply of qualified personnel, it also contributed extensively to Ashland's economic growth, becoming one of the largest employers in the county. During Holson's tenure, the company invested approximately $62 million in facilities renovation and expansion. In a talk given to the local Rotary club, Holson added that WIL Research at that time served approximately 550 clients (domestic and international), most of whom regularly visited Ashland to monitor their studies. In 2006, WIL Research received the Golden Oak award from the mayor of Ashland, an award recognizing \\"the foresight, diligence and unselfishness of individuals or organizations who contribute to new growth, strengthen the roots or improve the overall community of Ashland.\\" WIL Research also actively supported Ashland University, with many of its senior scientists serving as adjunct professors in their areas of expertise, especially in the undergraduate toxicology program, which the company helped begin in 1984. Dr. Joseph Holson also served on Ashland University's Science Advisory Board (1990-2008) and Board of Trustees (1993-1998), and gave the initial lecture, entitled \\"Risk and Regulation,\\" of a year-long lecture series in support of the university's Environmental Studies program in 1995.  Mergers and Acquisitions  After nearly two decades of sustained organic growth, Joseph Holson led WIL Research through an initial period of private capital-financed expansion. In 2004, Holson and four other senior executives (Mark D. Nemec, Dr. Christopher P. Chengelis, Dr. Daniel W. Sved, and James M. Rudar) initiated a management buyout (in partnership with private equity firm Behrman Capital) from Great Lakes Chemical Corporation which led to the formation of a holding company (WRH, Inc.). The expansion continued with the merger of Biotechnics, LLC (Hillsborough, NC, led by Dr. George Parker) with WIL Research operations in Ashland, the acquisitions of Notox Beheer BV ('s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands, let by Jan van der Hoeven, Dr. Wilbert Frieling, and Dr. Ilona Enninga) and QS Pharma LLC (Boothwyn, PA), and the subsequent $500 million sale of WRH, Inc. to American Capital, Ltd. (NASDAQ:ACAS) in 2007. After the sale to ACAS, Dr. Holson served as Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer of the global entity while continuing to serve as President and Director of WIL Research Laboratories in Ashland, Ohio until his retirement in November 2008. Upon Dr. Holson's retirement, Mr. Nemec was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer of the Ashland flagship facility, and Dr. Chengelis was named Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer. Under the ownership of American Capital, David Spaight was named Chairman and CEO of the global holding company in 2010, which undertook a re-branding and global integration effort. During the ACAS-led period, growth of the company occurred primarily through additional acquisitions, including those of Midwest BioResearch, LLC (Skokie, IL, led by Dr. Michael Schlosser) and Ricerca Bioscience's pharmaceutical services facility in Lyon, France (led by St√©phane Bulle). In addition, a new safety assessment facility in Schaijk, Netherlands (close to the existing Den Bosch site) was opened in 2015 to augment the European operations. These activities combined to increase the total number of employees in the global entity to more than 1300, with total 2015 revenues of $215 million. In early 2016, Wilmington, MA-based Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (NYSE:CRL), led by James C. Foster, acquired the global holdings of WIL Research for $585 million in cash. The platform WIL Research Laboratories facility in Ashland, OH was subsequently renamed to Charles River Laboratories Ashland, LLC.

Disability in Saudi Arabia is seen through the lens of Islamic Sharia, through cultural norms and also through legislation. As an Islamic society that follows the Qur'an and the Sunnah, disability is often seen through the lens of religion. Islam teaches that people with disabilities are to be treated with respect and equality. However, Saudi Arabia tends to view disability through the medical model, rather than the social model. In addition, there are few studies relating to people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia compared to other countries. Article 27 of the Saudi Basic Law states: \\" The State shall guarantee the rights of the citizens and their families in cases of emergency, illness, disability and old age. The State shall support the Social Insurance Law and encourage organizations and individuals to participate in philanthropic activities\\". The National Transformation Program 2020 states that one of the program's 37 goals is to integrate people with disability in the labor market.  Demographics  For many years, it was thought that the rate of disability in Saudi Arabia was low, but it turned out that many families were not integrating people with disabilities into daily life. A 2000 census found that 135,000 Saudi Arabian people have disabilities, with 33.7% of these being physical disabilities. More people with disabilities live in rural areas.  Causes  In 2010, statistics showed the leading cause of disability in Saudi Arabia for men was traffic injuries on the highway, while for women, the leading cause was major depressive disorder. The prevalence of depression in women is between 17 and 46 percent and early diagnosis is critical to both patient outcome and cost of treatment. Younger women are also more likely to intentionally attempt suicide. Another major cause of disability is close family intermarriage. First cousins marrying in Saudi Arabia is common. There is also a higher risk of congenital disability among parents who are disabled, older mothers and mothers who do not have adequate health care during pregnancy.  Cultural attitudes towards disability  A person with disability begging for money at Mount Arafat, 2011. In Islamic society, there is an emphasis in respecting the lives of people with disabilities. In general, Islam is against all kinds of discrimination, including discrimination against disability. There are many stories in early Islamic literature such as companions of Muhammad such as Julaybib In society, people with disabilities are often marginalized for various reasons, including lack of education about disabilities in communities and shame for having disability and the poverty that often accompanies disability. Parents of children with disabilities such as autism, often get information about their children's condition from non-medical sources, believing vaccinations or the evil eye caused the autism. Some parents turn to religion to help their children improve. Among health care professionals, there is an overall positive attitude towards people with disabilities, regardless of gender. It was found that doctors often did not give adequate health information to patients who have Down syndrome. It is still common for people who can afford it to receive medical treatment for disabilities in Western countries. It is politically correct to refer to people with disabilities as \\"people with special needs.\\"  Policy  Saudi Arabia bases its laws on Islamic Sharia. Islamic Sharia puts an emphasis on people with disabilities to have the rights \\"to live with dignity and benefit from welfare.\\" The Royal Family of Saudi Arabia is supportive of both private and public endeavors to help people with disabilities. The Ministry of Education runs several organizations to help people with disabilities. These include the Noor Institute for the Blind, the Amal Institute for the Deaf and the Institute for the Intellectually Disabled. Other organizations are run by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The Ministry of Health provides health services to most people in Saudi Arabia. People with disabilities in Saudi Arabia are entitled to 50% off airfare for themselves and a companion. They have the right to education, equal work and access to public space. People with disabilities are entitled to handicapped parking spaces and a subsidy of SR 10,000 to convert cars for specifications relating to their disability. Social security is available to individuals with disabilities or who become disabled later in life.  Non-governmental organizations  The King Salman Centre for Disability Research, Disabled Children Association and the Joint Centre for Research in Prosthetic and Orthopedics and Rehabilitation Programs are three non-governmental organizations operating in Saudi Arabia to help people with disabilities. Saudi Arabia hosts 44 associations and 347 day-care centers for people with special needs. There are also connected organisations which advise the Islamic governments in order they are regulated in occurrence to Islamic tradition. A leading International Islamic disability & Safeguarding Non-government Organisation Muslim Disability Awareness helps ensure Islamic Governments, their businesses, third sector remain accountable to the regulations defined in the Quran and Hadith in regards to the holistic rights of people with disabilities and those At-Risk.  Legislation  The rule of Law in Saudi Arabia is the Shariah law. The rights of Muslims with disabilities and the historic account are first found in the start of Islam with examples of Muhammad's companions Abd-Allah ibn Umm-Maktum and Julaybib. The first recognise ruling in Saudi Arabia to protect people with disabilities in Saudi Arabia was created in 1956 with Royal Decree No. 1219. This decree also directs government organizations to coordinate with non-governmental organizations so that services aren't duplicated. It is also concurrent with a major outbreak of polio in the country. In 1969, the labor code was established to define vocational rehabilitation for people with disabilities. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 407 in 1973 provided a monthly allowance for people with disabilities who \\"participate at Disabled Training Centers.\\" The next year, the Council of Ministers passed Resolution No. 715 which provided services for various people with disabilities who require medical care. The Decree No. 129 created policy for the General Department of Rehabilitation and created vocational and rehabilitation programs for people with disabilities. In 1980, under the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 219 allows the General Department of Rehabilitation is to give an annual donation of SR 30,000 to projects for people with disabilities which were created by people with disabilities themselves. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 187 in 1981 allowed people with disabilities and organizations they run to reprieve a 50% discount on government-owned transportation. In 1987, Legislation of Disability was created. In 1992, the Basic System, Issue No. A/90, article 27 ensures that citizens' rights are upheld in \\"cases of emergency, disability, or old age by providing social security.\\" In 1997, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 85 created the Person with Disabilities Services Coordination Committee. The resolution also created plans to raise awareness of disabilities and provided donations to families of people with disabilities. The Council of Ministers Resolution No. 7 of 1999 provides approval to raise donations up to SR 50,000 for rehabilitation programs developed by people with disabilities for training goals. Later, the Disability Code of 2000 was created. The disability code emphasizes the civil rights of people with disabilities to equally access free and \\"appropriate medical, psychological, social, educational, and rehabilitation services through public agencies.\\" The only provision of Saudi Arabian law that deal with accessibility is the Saudi Building Code (SBC) of 2007, which states that all buildings must be accessible, but doesn't provide exact determinations of what this needs to entail. Criticism of legislation for people with disabilities is that since it is most often based on the medical model of disability, it rarely deals with the social consequences that people with disability face in Saudi Arabia. Not dealing with the social aspects of disability means that there is not enough emphasis on integrating people into society. For example, despite the passage of SBC, many people who use wheelchairs face difficulty accessing public spaces in Saudi Arabia.  Education  The first special education services were provided for blind students who received education in \\"scientific institutes\\" in 1958. Prior to 1958, parents were expected to provide assistance to their children with disabilities. Official special education in Saudi Arabia was created in 1962, when the Ministry of Education established the Department of Special Learning. Like most schools in Saudi Arabia, special education classes are also gender segregated and teach Islamic principals. Special education is meant to take place in the least restrictive environment (LRE) and all students have an Individual Educational Program (IEP).  Unique challenges  Accessibility to buildings for those with physical disabilities in Saudi Arabia is lacking. In addition, there are more services and organizations for people with disabilities in urban areas. Saudi Arabia offers limited mental health services. Prosthetics must be engineered to help people be able to attend and perform the Muslim Call to Prayer.  Gender and disability  Women in Saudi Arabia often must use women-only clinics which are often not accessible for individuals with physical or \\"hidden\\" disabilities. Women's restrictions in Saudi Arabia limit their ability to access mental health services, however this is changing. Unfortunately, some Ladies with disabilities have often been hidden at home so that people are not afraid to marry into their family and this is connected to colonialism and Darwinism ideology and not from Islam.

Delphi is also the name of the modern-day municipality in which the town of Delphi is situated. The city of Delphi was named after the Oracle of Delphi, who supposedly foretold the future. Town It is on a major highway linking Amfissa along with Itea and Arachova. There are many hotels and guest houses in the town, and many taverns and bars. The main streets are narrow, and often one-way. The E4 European long distance path passes through the east end of the town. In addition to the archaeological interest, Delphi attracts tourists visiting the Parnassus Ski Center and the popular coastal towns of the region. In the Middle Ages a town called Kastri was built on the archaeological site. The residents had used the marble columns and structures as support beams and roofs for their improvised houses, a usual way of rebuilding towns that were partially or totally destroyed, especially after the earthquake in 1580, which demolished several towns in Phocis. In 1893 archaeologists from the √âcole fran√ßaise d'Ath√®nes finally located the actual site(see link) of ancient Delphi and the village was moved to a new location, west of the site of the temples.

History SkipTheDishes was founded in 2012 by brothers Josh and Chris Simair. At the time, Chris was living in Saskatchewan, Canada and working at Cameco Corporation as an IT Solutions Architect and Josh was living in London, UK and working with RBC as an Investment Banker. Each day, Josh and his colleagues worked long hours and often ordered food to their office from local restaurants. Josh began to recognize that there was an opportunity to help other working professionals gain time in their days by building out a more efficient online food ordering delivery network. Eventually, both resigned from their jobs and began working on the concept for SkipTheDishes. They launched the network in their home city of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and eventually moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba to set up the tech company‚Äôs head office. Founders Between 2012 and 2014, three additional co-founders joined to help grow the startup. Another brother, Daniel Simair, joined, along with two friends from university - Jeff Adamson and Andrew Chau. Investment During the first few years of operations, the co-founders bootstrapped the company and raised a small round of seed capital from angel investors. Shortly after, the co-founders raised additional capital from private investors, as well as four prominent venture capital firms - Golden Venture Partners (Toronto, Ontario), Founder Collective (New York, New York), Felicis Ventures (Menlo Park, California), and FJ Labs (Cambridge, Massachusetts). Geography As the company scaled between 2013‚Äì2016, the co-founders launched SkipTheDishes in many Canadian cities, initially focusing on mid-market cities, including Burnaby, East Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, Prince Albert, Grande Prairie, Regina, Saskatoon, Winnipeg, Mississauga, Etobicoke, Kitchener/Waterloo, and Ottawa, as well as US cities, including Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Omaha, and St. Louis. Acquisition In December 2016, SkipTheDishes was acquired by Just Eat for $200M. SkipTheDishes remained a subsidiary and separate brand from Just Eat, with its Canadian headquarters to stay in Winnipeg. As of September 2018, Just Eat Canada redirects to SkipTheDishes. Growth and Expansion Over the course of 2017, SkipTheDishes was recognized for its growth on a number of occasions. The company's founder was chosen as one of Canada's Top 40 Under 40. Just Eat's CEO, Peter Plumb, reported significant increases in the company's Q3 - 2017 revenue, due to \\"strong growth in order numbers and the inclusion of SkipTheDishes business\\". In 2017, the company expanded its business model into new offerings other than food, starting with alcohol delivery in select markets. In March 2019, SkipTheDishes pulled out of the United States market. Their business and drivers were transferred to Grubhub. In early 2020, Just Eat merged with Netherlands-based competitor Takeaway.com, forming Just Eat Takeaway, shortly thereafter announcing a deal to acquire the aforementioned Grubhub. In July 2020, in line with Just Eat's other markets, SkipTheDishes adopted Takeaway.com's logo and orange colour scheme, though keeping the SkipTheDishes brand name. Technology SkipTheDishes' technology allows customers to order food online. Customers order through the SkipTheDishes website or mobile iOS and Android apps. They can pay for their orders online with a credit card or debit card, or in person with cash when their orders arrive. Restaurants receive orders on their integrated mobile apps, and couriers are allocated to orders through their integrated mobile apps. Customers can view the status of their orders through live updates on the app, and are given transparency into the location of their assigned courier through GPS tracking. Restaurants and couriers can be reviewed by customers after they have received their orders. This helps to provide both feedback and transparency to the rest of the network about the efficiency and effectiveness of its stakeholders. SkipTheDishes operates across Canada and formerly operated in select markets in the United States. Since its founding in 2012, SkipTheDishes continues to advance the technological innovation required for building the future of food delivery, while being instrumental in helping to create a tech hub in the Canadian Prairies. Criticism Like many companies involved in the sharing economy, SkipTheDishes has received criticism for its business practices. In March 2017, the company received negative publicity for its responses to a job candidate's question about compensation and benefits. As a follow up to the incident, Emily Norgang of the Canadian Labour Congress stated that \\"the most innovative aspect isn't the technology itself, but actually the expansion of this exploitative business model\\". As of May 2020, SkipTheDishes has the lowest rating of F from the Better Business Bureau due to volume of unresolved complaints.

He was the son of Zhi Shen. He was the last Zhongjunjiang (Prime minister) of Jin before its partition. Zhi Yao's dramatic death was a significant event in Chinese history. As the dominant vassal state, he asked Kangzi of Han, Huanzi of Wei and Xiangzi of Zhao to cede their lands to the Zhi clan. Han and Wei did so according to Zhi's wish. However, Zhao refused to give lands to Zhi clan. Xiangzi was triggered and led his army, along with the army from Han and Wei, laid siege on the Zhao capital Jinyang (modern Taiyuan). The siege lasted two years before it came to a dramatic end. Zhao conspired with Han and Wei's ruler, Xiangzi was betrayed by his own allies and defeated. Zhao decapitated Zhi Yao and massacred his entire family of over 200 members. After the fall of Zhi clan, no vassals in Jin could once again match the power of Zhao, Han, and Wei. The Duke of Jin was consequently turned into a figurehead. This eventually led to the Partition of Jin and the establishment of Han, Zhao and Wei as independent states acknowledged by the Zhou dynasty King of China, marking the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period.  Ascendance  When choosing Xiangzi as his successor, Xuanzi of Zhi was warned by his clansman Zhi Guo who believed that Xiangzi's personality did not fit the quality of a ruler.

In the Zuo Zhuan, it is shown that Xiangzi of Zhi resented oracles of I Ching because Zhi believed in his own power. In 468 BC, Xiangzi of Zhi invaded the state of Zheng. Zheng's retainer Sihong then asked Qi for reinforcement. With the intervention of Qi, Zhi had to abandon his plan of invading Zheng. In 464 BC, Zhi once more entered Zheng's realm with the troops from Zhi clan and Zhao clan. Zheng's Sihong organized resistance against them.Zuo Zhuan, Duke Ai, 27th year of In 458 BC, Zhi united the army of Han, Zhao and Wei, he attacked and exterminated two major clans of Jin: the Fan and the Zhonghang. On the one hand Zhi took most parts of Fan and Zhonghang's fief, on the other hand he also climbed to the top of Jin's court. Zhao clan which was in charge before Zhi's sudden rise, was substituted. In an occasion of banquet, Xiangzi of Zhi and Xiangzi of Zhao met. According to Han dynasty scholar Liu An, Zhi slapped on Zhao's skull. This insult offended Zhao's retainers deeply but also strengthened Zhao's patience. Xiangzi then conquered the vassal state Qiuyou of Zhongshan. In 457 BC, He greedily claimed lands from Han , Wei and Zhao. Unexpectedly, Xiangzi of Zhao refused Zhi's request harshly. Xiangzi of Zhi was enraged by Zhao's response to him. He led his troops marched to Zhao's territory with the help of Han and Wei.

Balsara arrived in the United States in 1900, as a cotton buyer for the Tata group and both settled and married in New York. He applied for citizenship in 1906 but was granted the status only in 1909 after he fought his case before two courts, the Circuit Court in New York and the Federal Court of Appeal. This is as the initial presiding judge, Emile Henry Lacombe in the Circuit Court only reluctantly conferred American citizenship on Balsara, as he reasoned that there ‚Äúwas much force in the argument that the Congress which framed the original act for naturalization of aliens... intended it to include only white persons belonging to the races whose emigrants had contributed to the building up on this continent of the community of people which declared itself a new nation....\\" Lacombe, however, conceded that Balsara \\"appears to be a gentleman of high character and exceptional intelligence.\\" Lacombe only gave Balsara citizenship on the hope that the United States attorney would indeed challenge his decision and appeal it to create ‚Äúan authoritative interpretation‚Äù of the law.

The organisation was shut down on 31 May 2018.Activate deactivated: Conservative's Momentum imitation folds after 8 months. The London Economic. Author - Jack Peat. Published 31 May 2018. Retrieved 3 June 2018. History Sam Ancliff claimed that Activate \\"evolved\\" from a collaboration of a lot of different people from different communities of people looking for a new Conservative youth group following the suspension of Conservative Future. The group appointed Conservative councillor and campaign manager Gary Markwell as their chairman. Because of this, Red Pepper described it as a Conservative \\"astroturf\\" group. The organisation was criticised when conservative blogger Guido Fawkes revealed that individuals within a WhatsApp group described by Fawkes as a \\"precursor\\" to Activate made comments about gassing \\"chavs\\", performing \\"medical experiments on them ... [using] them as substitutes for animals\\", as well as mandating \\"compulsory birth control on chavs\\". The Mirror claimed that at least two people involved in the chat had links to Activate. A spokesperson later said that none of the individuals \\"have any seniority\\" within Activate, and that they found the comments \\"sickening and are totally incompatible with what Activate is trying to achieve\\". The organisation had been criticised for being out of touch with younger people. The membership costs of up to ¬£500 per person were widely seen as extortionate. An Activate source claimed that one of the founders of the organisation had received death threats, and that almost all of the main figures within Activate had been targeted by abuse and harassment. Having gained prominence in August 2017, Activate held a launch event in March 2018 in London, attended by 28 people in a room booked for 150. The event saw speeches from two Conservative councillors.

Born in Missouri, Scott joined the Rocky Mountain Fur Company in 1822 and took part in the first fur trade expedition at the Great Salt Lake in Utah. He died at age 23 near a cliff along the North Platte River in Nebraska which was named in his honor. The circumstances leading to his demise have given rise to many diverse accounts and theories.  Early life and career  Hiram Scott was born in 1805 in St. Charles County, Missouri. Described as an abnormally towering and strapping figure with a dark complexion, in 1822 Scott was employed by William Henry Ashley and Andrew Henry's Rocky Mountain Fur Company, a pioneering enterprise which funded explorations into the western United States' wilderness. The company's Superintendent of Indian Affairs William Clark had granted Ashley and Henry a license to trade with Native Americans in Missouri, actively encouraging them to compete with the influential British fur trade in the Pacific Northwest. Scott was a member of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company's first expedition along the Missouri River between 1822 and 1823. On June 2, 1823, Scott fought alongside fellow frontiersmen near the Missouri River who were attacked by warriors of the Arikara tribe. Fifteen trappers died during the raid; a war between the United States government and the Arikara broke out soon after. Until 1828, Scott, who served in the same capacity as a clerk, recorded transactions with Native Americans and led explorations from the Great Salt Lake frontier. He attended the first rendezvous at the fur trader post situated near Salt Lake in 1826 and participated in two other expeditions held there. In 1827, Scott and James Bruffee were co-leaders of a caravan traveling to the Bear Lake rendezvous and returned with $20,000 (US) worth of pelts in October of the same year. Ashley sent the pair back to the same location a month later to trap more beaver. It was relayed that during an expedition in 1828 Scott and Bruffee engaged in a battle with Blackfoot Indians, creating speculation that the skirmish may have incapacitated Scott on his return journey to St. Louis; hence some accounts have attributed his eventual demise to Blackfoot Indians. Illness and death Saddle Rock formation in Scotts Bluff National Monument Most likely, Scott contracted a severe illness on his eastward journey to St. Louis. Accompanied by two companions, he was transported in a bull boat on the North Platte River in hopes of reconnecting with a larger trading party. Along the way, their vessel overturned; the group's rifles and food supplies were lost. According to Warren A. Ferris, the first person to record an account of Scott's death, his companions abandoned him on the north bank of the river. The following year, Scott's remains were discovered on the opposite side of the North Platte near the bluffs which now bear his name, implying he managed to make a crossing before his death. A similar account of Scott succumbing to illness and being abandoned to die by his companions was recounted by trapper and fur explorer William Sublette in his diary; Sublette added that he returned to the site of the bluffs the following summer to collect and bury Scott's scattered bones.Mattes (1987), pp. 434‚Äì435. Variations to the event suggest Scott was deserted by his companions earlier along the route and he traversed miles of frontier before dying. Another take on the incident theorized, in an act of self-sacrifice, Scott insisted upon his expedition members to leave him behind, while others suspect foul play may have been involved.Mattes (1987), p. 430. Legacy Other sites named after Scott are Scotts Bluff County and the city of Scottsbluff, both in Nebraska; and the former Hiram Scott College in Scottsbluff.

Her writing covers racism, misogynoir, intersectionality, online harassment, the Black Lives Matter movement, economics, parenting, feminism, and social justice. She gained prominence for articles critiquing race and the invisibility of women's voices, like her interview with Rachel Dolezal. Career  Early career  Oluo began her career in technology and digital marketing. She turned to writing in her mid-30s after the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, who was at the same age as her son, Malcolm, at the time. Fearful for her son as well as her younger brother, a musician then traveling on tour, Oluo began sharing long-held concerns via a blog she'd previously devoted to food writing. She has described these initial forays as a significant influence on her writing style, as she hoped that sharing personal stories would be a way to connect to and activate her predominantly white community in Seattle. Oluo has said she was disappointed by the response she initially received, and that many of her existing friends \\"fell away\\" instead of engaging in the issues she had begun raising; however, many black women she hadn't previously known reached out to express appreciation and Oluo's profile as a writer grew, with publishers asking to reprint work from her blog and eventually commissioning new writing.  Journalism and commentary  Recording the Lovett or Leave It podcast on January 27, 2018 at the Moore Theatre in Seattle. Hosted by Jon Lovett (left) and Akilah Hughes (second from left), with guests Lindy West (second from right) and Ijeoma Oluo (right). Oluo's columns and news articles appeared in The Guardian and The Stranger newspapers from 2015 through 2017, and she has also written for Jezebel, Medium and The Establishment, a publication based at Medium that Oluo helped launch; she is an editor-at-large. Her writing covers topics like misogynoir, intersectionality, online harassment, the Black Lives Matter movement, race, economics, parenting, feminism and social justice. She is known for critiques of race and the erasure of black women's voices in the United States, as exemplified in Oluo's April 2017 interview of Rachel Dolezel. Oluo stopped writing for The Stranger in July 2017; her reasons included the paper's decision to publish an article on detransitioning that Oluo said was \\"written by a cis woman without the knowledge and language necessary to responsibly report on the subject in a way that would not feed into the narrative of anti- trans bigots. The piece quotes a doctor widely discredited for junk science, with a well-known anti-trans bias.\\" Though Oluo has taken strong stands on many social issues, she has also said fans should be comfortable criticizing and speaking honestly about errors such as expressions of sexism, racism, or classism by their favorite celebrities, without having to condemn or reject anyone as irredeemable, and that critics generally share many of the same flaws they call out in others. She wrote in 2015 that, \\"Being anti-racist doesn't mean that you are never racist, it means that you recognize and battle racism in yourself as hard as you battle it in others.\\" She expanded on this theme of honest dialogue about uncomfortable truths in her 2018 book, writing that \\"This does not mean that you have to flog yourself for all eternity.\\" Oluo wrote on her blog in November 2017 that USA Today had asked her to write an op-ed, but only on the condition that Oluo's article argue against the need for due process with regard to sexual misconduct allegations such as the high- profile cases associated with the Me Too movement. Specifically she said that the editors \\"want a piece that says that you don't believe in due process and that if a few innocent men lose their jobs it's worth it to protect women.\\" Oluo was willing to rebut the USA Today editorial that the accused are at great risk of their rights to due process being violated, but said she would not play the role of \\"their strawman\\", since she did in fact believe in everyone's right to due process. After Oluo wrote about the USA Today offer, The Washington Post responded with an editorial by Christine Emba that shared Oluo's position that the greatest violations of due process had been against the rights of harassment victims who had been denied justice for many years, and that such protestations over due process were, in Oluo's words, \\"attempt to re-center the concerns of men\\". Oluo had said that such apparent concern for due process was intended to, \\"stop women from coming forward before too many men are held accountable for their actions\\". = Temporary Facebook suspension = Oluo's Facebook account was temporarily suspended in 2017. She had made a joke on Twitter that she felt uncomfortable around \\"white folk in cowboy hats\\" the first time she went in a Cracker Barrel. In response, she received hundreds of threats and racist messages on Twitter and to her Facebook account. Twitter took down tweets and banned users who were breaking its terms of service, but Oluo said Facebook did nothing for three days. Her account was suspended after Oluo posted screenshots of the messages, saying Facebook was not doing anything to help. Facebook later apologized and reactivated her account, saying the suspension had been a mistake. Oluo said the Facebook accounts of several other black activists have been suspended after publicly posting screenshots of threatening messages they had received, and each time Facebook said it was a mistake.  Books  = The Badass Feminist Coloring Book = In 2015, Oluo self-published The Badass Feminist Coloring Book using Amazon's CreateSpace. The project began with Oluo sketching outlines of favorite feminists as a stress reliever; encouraged by friends, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to create a coloring book of 45 sketches and accompanying quotes. Well before the deadline, the project raised more than double its goal. Feminists depicted in The Badass Feminist Coloring Book include Lindy West (Oluo's sister-in-law), comedian Hari Kondabolu, writer Feminista Jones and musician Kimya Dawson (of The Moldy Peaches). = So You Want to Talk About Race = Oluo's book So You Want to Talk about Race was published on January 16, 2018 by the Seal Press imprint of Perseus Books Group's Da Capo. In its \\"New & Noteworthy\\" column, The New York Times described the book as \\"tak[ing] on the thorniest questions surrounding race, from police brutality to who can use the 'N' word.\\" Oluo began the project at the suggestion of her agent, who proposed Oluo write a guidebook to discussing the topics she was writing about regularly. Oluo was initially reluctant, feeling she already spent more time dealing with race than she wanted ‚Äî speaking to Bitch magazine, she said, \\"Think about how much time you want to spend, as a Black woman, talking about race, and then dedicating a whole book to talking about race. It's tough for me.\\" But as she considered the idea, she found many people reached out with topics, and ultimately she decided that a book might save her from having to answer the same questions over and over; in particular she hoped a book's tangible form might reach people in a different way than online work did. Bustle named So You Want to Talk about Race to a list of 14 recommended debut books by women, praising Oluo's \\"no holds barred writing style\\", as well as to a list of the 16 best non-fiction books of January 2018.

It was Inge's first response to the Norwegian King Magnus Barefoot who had a year or two earlier invaded V√§sterg√∂taland, hoping to expand the Norwegian border down to the G√∂ta√§lv. The battle itself is in its entirety described by Snorri Sturlason in his work Heimskringla. Prelude Magnus Barefoot, years prior to 1099, had expanded Norwegian influence around the Irish sea. It wasn't until late summer in 1099 that he finally had returned to Norway. His motives however changed and he decided to head east, with the idea of expanding the Norwegian border down to the G√∂ta√§lv, Which used to be the ancient border between Norway and V√§sterg√∂taland (Which was now Swedish territory). Magnus did just that, and successfully invaded V√§sterg√∂taland and defeated the Swedish forces at the First Battle of Fuxerna. After the successful occupation and expansion of the Norwegian border, Magnus built a wooden fortification on the Island of K√•llands√∂ leaving behind a force of 300 men to guard it. When Inge Stenkilsson (Also known as Inge the Younger) heard of this, he immediately summoned the leidang (Which was about 3,000 to 3,600 men. In realistic measures however, bringing the entire leidang would be an unstable decision because it would remove the entire kingdoms defensive forces. The likely estimated number of men would thus be less. The correct number of men could therefore really be anywhere between c. 1,000 - 3,000) and set his eyes to regain the lands he just had lost. Battle Inge arrived at K√•llands√∂ during the winter and the waters around the island had completely frozen, giving him the ability to walk across the ice. Before actually storming the fort, Inge offered the entire Norwegian force multiple times to live and even to keep their loot they had previously gained during the invasion if they abandoned the fortification. The Norwegians however refused the offer at all times and didn't leave the fort. Thus when the Norwegians for the last time refused the offer, Inge ordered the storming to begin. Both the attackers and defenders immediately began shooting ranged fire at each other. While this was happening, the rest of the Swedish force could actually not reach the initial wall of the fort itself as a grave had been built around it. So Inge ordered them to fill it with stone and logs. Once this was done, the Swedes gathered large wooden beams with anchors attached at the end of them. Using these beams, the Swedes climbed up on them and into the fort. Some of them even managed to tear down sections of the wall. Once inside the fort, they began to set it on fire. Realizing that the fort was sooner or later completely burning to the ground, the Norwegians surrendered. King Inge managed to capture the rest of the Norwegian force. However, despite that the Norwegians refused the chance of surrender prior to the siege, King Inge still released the captured Norwegians after being beaten by sticks and stripped of their loot. The prisoners then made their way back to Norway. Aftermath The loss of the fortification and previously conquered land was told to King Magnus Barefoot by Sigurd, who had been one of the leaders of the garrison and released by King Inge Stenkilsson after the Siege. Magnus was enraged and decided to take revenge, he thus once again invaded V√§sterg√∂taland. The second invasion concluded with Inge successfully ambushing Magnus at the Second battle of Fuxerna.

The book has won widespread acclaim and won Tharoor the 2019 Sahitya Akademi Award and the 2017 Ramnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Award.  Background  Tharoor made a speech at a 2015 Oxford Union debate on the topic \\"Does Britain owe reparations to its former colonies?\\", which went viral over the web. Subsequently, his publisher floated the idea to transform the speech into a book; despite being initially sceptical, he went on to write a 330 page book.  Reception  The book has won a lot of acclaim as well as some criticism. The Hindu Business Line called the book \\"one breathless read\\". The Guardian called it a \\"passionately argued book [which] provides a crushing rebuttal of such ideas with regard to India\\". Tabish Khair praised the book for presenting an 'intricate mixture of fact and anecdotes' that served as an effective counter to the view of 'colonial apologists' but at the same time, did praise the British, when it merited. In a review published in the Cambridge Review of International Affairs, economic historian, Tirthankar Roy, a faculty at the London School of Economics heavily criticized the book. He noted that whilst the facts were beyond dispute Tharoor's analysis and interpretation were wrong. Another review of Inglorious Empire, published in the Literary Review, by historian John Keay, whose many writings on India include India: A History, applauds Tharoor for \\"tackling an impossibly contentious subject\\". However, he deplores the fact that \\"moral venom sometimes clouds his judgement\\" and notes that many of Tharoor's statistics are seriously out of date, many coming from the polemics contained in the American Will Durant's Story of Civilisation written in the 1930s, which itself drew on the even earlier work of the crusading American missionary Jabej T. Sutherland, author of India in Bondage. A more detailed criticism of Tharoor's book and his use of statistics was set out by the writer of South Asian history Charles Allen in a lecture entitled Quis custodiet ipsos custodes: who owns Indian history? read to the Royal Society for Asian Affairs in London on 25April 2018. A revised version was published in Asian Affairs under the revised title Who Owns India's History? A Critique of Shashi Tharoor's Inglorious Empire.

It has a circum-polar distribution and is found in the Arctic Ocean, the northern Atlantic Ocean and the northern Pacific. Description Ophiopholis aculeata has a central pentagonal disc up to in diameter; this is clearly set off from the five robust, twisted arms, which are four times as long as the disc is wide. The mouth is on the oral or underside of the disc and is surrounded by five toothed jaws. The aboral or upper side of the disc is granular, and a pair of large scales, the radial shield, covers the base of each arm. The radial shield is covered with small spines which conceal the scales. The many-jointed arms are covered with more scales both on the oral and aboral surfaces; on the aboral surface there is a regular series of oval scales each surrounded by smaller scales. There are six or seven stout spines per segment, with one short spine being hooked. The colour varies, being often reddish or variegated, and sometimes purplish; the central scales on the disc often form a ten-pointed star and there are often darker bands on the arms. Distribution and habitat This brittle star has a circum-boreal distribution. In the northern Atlantic Ocean it is common around Iceland, Spitzbergen and Norway southwards to the North Sea. On the eastern coast of North America its range extends from Greenland southwards to Long Island, and in the Pacific Ocean, its range stretches from Japan and the Bering Sea southwards to California. It is generally found on rocky substrates where it has a tendency to hide inside shells, in hollows and crevices. It generally occurs at depths less than but has been found as deep as . Biology Ophiopholis aculeata feeds on detritus and small organisms that it traps with its tube feet and with mucus secreted by glands on its arms. It is preyed on by fish and birds. The sexes are separate in this species, and fertilisation is external. Mass spawning events have been seen, with all the individuals of this species in a locality releasing their spawn at the same time in response to some environmental cue. This has been observed in Jamaica at night, during the period 20:00 hours to 22:00 hours, and in both morning and afternoon in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Canada. The cue that triggers a spawning event may be a change in the temperature of the water. Spawning tends to occur at in Alaska, and about a degree cooler than this further north in the White Sea. Several spawning events have occurred when warmer surface waters have down- welled into deep, colder water layers. The larvae of brittle stars are known as ophiopluteus larvae and form part of the plankton. When they are fully developed, they settle on the seabed and undergo metamorphosis into juvenile brittle stars.

In 2004 Rowland worked with Howe a/s to introduce an expanded family of the 40/4 chair. alt= History Rowland developed the 40/4 chair over a period of 8 years. In 1963 he was awarded a patent for the chair's design. Initially, Rowland showed the chair to many companies in an effort to license the design. In 1961, Florence Knoll licensed the chair for her company, Knoll Associates, however canceled a license after six months. Rowland later showed the chair to Davis Allen, head of interior design at the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM). Allen requested 17,000 chairs for the a campus SOM was designing for the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). To fulfill the request, Rowland licensed the design to General Fireproofing Co. (GF) in Youngstown, Ohio. In May 1965, While the first order for was still being produced, 250 chairs were hand assembled and installed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City for the opening of its new wing. The 40/4 was an immediate success. It won the grand prize at the prestigious 13th Milan Triennale, and has been included in museum collections and exhibitions internationally.

The chair has been in continuous production since its introduction and has sold over 8 million units. General Fireproofing held the license for the chair from 1963 until 2002 when the company was taken over by OSI Furniture LLC. In 2013, Howe Europe, (now Howe a/s), of Denmark, which had had a sublicense to the chair in Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (except for Indonesia) acquired the license for the 40/4 in the United States and Canada.

Austin by Elisabet Ney is a statue of Texas founder Stephen F. Austin which is part of the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. It is one of the two statues in the National Statuary Hall representing Texas; the other, of Sam Houston, is also by Ney. Both statues were unveiled in Washington, D.C. in 1905.Architect of the Capitol Under the Direction of the Joint Committee on the Library, Compilation of Works of Art and Other Objects in the United States Capitol, United States Government Printing Office, Washington 1965, pp. 210‚Äì211. History In 1892, Ney was commissioned by the Board of Lady Managers to execute statues of Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston for the Texas Building at the World's Columbian Exposition to be held the following year. She agreed to do this without payment for her efforts. Because she executed the Houston statue before the Austin, which portrayed him dressed in buckskin, holding a Kentucky long rifle in one hand and a scroll in the other, the statue was not finished on time and was never displayed in Chicago. When critics complained that the Houston statue was six foot two inches tall and the Austin statue was only five foot seven she replied that those are the actual heights of the men and that anyone with a problem should \\"take the issue up not with her but with God\\". Upon completion of her clay model it was decided to produce two versions of the statue in marble, one for the Texas State Capitol and the other for the National Statuary Hall Collection in Washington, D.C. In 1901, the state legislature appropriated the funds necessary for the carving.Fortune, Jan And Jean Burton, ‚ÄúElisabet Nye, Alfred a Knopf, New York, 1943 p. 242.

During his life the Glorious Revolution took place which directly affected his family and estate, and during his chiefdom he served the British-Hanoverian Government during the Jacobite rising of 1715 and the Jacobite rising of 1745. Early life George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, was the only son of Donald Mackay, Master of Reay, and his wife Ann, daughter of Sir George Munro of Culrain (of Newmore).Mackay. pp. 161‚Äì162. The Master of Reay was killed in an accident in 1680 when a barrel of gunpowder exploded whilst hunting in the Reay Forest, and his father, John Mackay, 2nd Lord Reay, died not long after. George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, therefore succeeded his grandfather, the 2nd Lord Reay.Mackay. p. 163. The Glorious Revolution The period of 1680‚Äì1688 was of growing religious persecution in Scotland with the House of Stuart steering for political perdition. Charles II of England died in 1685 and was succeeded by his brother James II of England and VII of Scotland. James roused the Scots Covenanters to desperation and also alienated himself from many of the Cavalier families, until finally in 1688 the Stuarts were overthrown in the Glorious Revolution and replaced by William of Orange.Mackay. pp. 163‚Äì164. The Mackay's lands of Strathnaver had offered asylum to persecuted Covenanters and John Mackay, 7th of Aberach, chieftain of the Mackay of Aberach branch of the clan had also supported the Covenanters.Mackay. p. 164. Jacobite rising of 1689 A Jacobite rising broke out in 1689 in support of the exiled Stuarts and a Mackay clansman, General Hugh Mackay of Scoury was appointed by William of Orange as Commander-in-Chief of the forces in Scotland.Mackay. pp. 166‚Äì171. Hugh Mackay was defeated by the Jacobites at the Battle of Killiecrankie although the Jacobite leader John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, was killed in the battle. This Jacobite rising was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld and the Battle of Cromdale the following year in 1690. General Hugh Mackay went on to support William of Orange during the Williamite War in Ireland and was killed at the Battle of Steenkerque in Belgium in 1692.Mackay. pp. 171‚Äì172. In 1693 or 1694, shortly after the death of his grandfather Sir George Munro of Culrain, the young George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, travelled over to Holland where his two uncles Aneas and Robert Mackay were on service as Lieutenant-General and Colonel.Mackay. pp. 172‚Äì173. One of these uncles died in 1696 and the other in 1697. According to historian Angus Mackay at this time a strong stream of Strathnaver men (Mackays) flowed abroad as soldiers of fortune and some were on the ill-fated Darien scheme. In December 1702 George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, entered into a contract of marriage with Margaret, daughter of General Hugh Mackay of Scoury.Mackay. p. 176. Lord Reay then received the estates of Eddrachilis and Scoury as the dowry which were a large and valuable addition to the Reay Estate. Jacobite rising of 1715 In 1714, Anne, Queen of Great Britain, died leaving no issue and the crown once more passed to a foreign-born descendant of the Scottish kings, George I of Great Britain who was from the House of Hanover and who was a grandson of James VI of Scotland and I of England.Mackay. p. 177. The Jacobite rising of 1715 broke out in favour of the exiled James Francis Edward Stuart who was proclaimed James VIII by his supporters. The rising was led by the Jacobite John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar. John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland, supporter of the British-Hanoverian Government had received a commission as the king's Lieutenant and arrived by boat from London at his seat Dunrobin Castle on 28 September 1715.Mackay. p. 178. A week later he set out from Dunrobin with 400 of his tenants to Tain where he found George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, with 500 Mackays and 200 Rosses waiting in support of him.Mackay. pp. 177‚Äì178. At Alness they were also joined by the Munros and had obtained six small canons. At Alness, Sutherland's combined force numbered 1800 men. However, the advancing Jacobite force under William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth, consisted of 3000 men.Sage, Rev. Donald, A. M. (1789‚Äì1869). Minister of Resolis. Edited by his son. Memorabilia Domestica or Parish Life in the North of Scotland. Chapter 1. pp. 4‚Äì5. In what is now known as the Skirmish of Alness, the Earl of Sutherland and Lord Reay retreated back over Bonar Bridge into Sutherland.Mackay. p. 180. After this the Earl of Seaforth and his force joined up with that of the Earl of Mar, but the Jacobite rising ended in failure at the indecisive Battle of Sheriffmuir on 14 November 1715. On the same day other Jacobites under Mackenzie of Coul were defeated at the Siege of Inverness (1715). Meanwhile the Earl of Seaforth sped back towards Inverness from Sheriffmuir. However, Inverness having fallen, 200 Sutherlands, 150 Mackays, 300 Grants, 150 Munros and 50 Forbes of Culloden set out to give Seaforth battle, but he avoided them making his way back to Brahan Castle while his pursuers halted at Fraser of Lovat's Castle Downie until the Earl of Sutherland arrived with more troops. The Earl of Seaforth then escaped to the Isle of Lewis and from there to exile in France along with other Jacobites including the Earl of Mar. Jacobite rising of 1719 In 1718 a war broke out between Britain and Spain and the Jacobites of Clan Macdonald of Clanranald, Clan Cameron of Lochiel, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Chisholm, as well as the Earl of Seaforth were joined by a Spanish division who had landed in the west of Ross- shire towards the end of April 1719.Mackay. p. 181. At the Battle of Glen Shiel the Mackays under Ensign Hugh Mackay and Sutherlands who together supported the Government were posted on the right wing and the Jacobites were defeated. Also in 1719 George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, who was an elder in the Kirk applied to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland to furnish his people with clergyman and school masters, and his proposal included dividing the large parish of Durness into three parishes: Tongue, Durness, and Ederachilis, each of which would be provided with a minister and school master.Mackay. p. 183. In 1725 the General Assemby accepted his proposals. Jacobite rising of 1745 Between 1741 and 1744 political warfare raged between Mackay, Lord Reay, and the Earl of Sutherland.Mackay. p. 186. This had started in 1737 in a dispute over estates which was submitted to arbitration but then the arrangement broke down. However, when the Jacobite rising of 1745 broke out George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, realized the necessity of united action by those who were friendly to the existing Government. A bond of friendship was then arranged by Lord Reay between him and Sutherland.Mackay. pp. 186‚Äì187. At the request of Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden, Lord Reay, Sutherland, Grant, Seaforth and Munro sent levies of troops to Inverness to join John Campbell, 4th Earl of Loudoun, who was a supporter of the Government and who had assumed command of any troops that could be gathered together.Mackay. p. 188. George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, was a Jacobite rebel, as was his son John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod (not to be confused with the Laird of MacLeod, who supported the Government at this time). According to Angus Mackay, while Lord MacLeod was at Thurso, Caithness, where there was a Jacobite meeting house until after the Battle of Culloden he was joined by the men of Loch Broom under the brother of Mackenzie of Ballone.Mackay. p. 189. Lord MacLeod then made an attempt to invade the Mackay lands of Strathnaver but finding that the Mackays were prepared to contest their passage, backed down. The opposing force of Mackays was probably under the command of Hugh Mackay of Bighouse, son of Lord Reay. On 25 March 1746 Lord Reay's son, Captain George Mackay of Skibo led a contingent of Mackays at the Skirmish of Tongue,Simpson. p. 135. where money and supplies destined for the Jacobite cause were captured from a French ship,Pollard. p. 34.MacLeod. p. 338. and 156 Jacobites were taken prisoner.Mackay. pp. 190‚Äì191. In response the Jacobite commander, Charles Edward Stuart, sent a large Jacobite force north under the command of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie.Simpson. pp. 135‚Äì136. However, they arrived too late to be of any use and were attacked by surprise by the 2nd Sutherland Company under the command of Ensign John Mackay and also the 2nd Mackay Company. This was known as the Battle of Littleferry where the Jacobite force was completely defeated, losing about 100 dead,MacLeod. p. 340. and was prevented from providing much needed support to the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden that took place the next day and which they would have been late for anyway. George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, then travelled to Leith on the ship named The Sheerness, which had pursued the Jacobites in the Skirmish of Tongue, and remained in the south until the following autumn.Mackay. p. 192. In a letter to a government official dated 2 September 1746, Lord Reay suggested the need to erect new churches and to spread the Gospel among the disaffected. George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, was a Fellow of the Royal Society. He died at Tongue on 21 March 1746. Family George Mackay, 3rd Lord Reay, had married firstly, Margaret, daughter of General Hugh Mackay of Scoury, and had one son:Mackay. pp. 192‚Äì194. #Donald Mackay, 4th Lord Reay.

He did, and afterwards went to run some errands with his two sons. When they returned, the house was locked and Tammy was not there. A note inside the house, apparently left by Tammy, said she was going for a walk and would be back soon, but she never returned and has not been seen since. Tammy's family said it would have been unusual for her to leave a note, or walk in the woods near their North Augusta home. In the house, she had left her purse, phone, and keys, which would have been needed to lock the door. An extensive search of the area around the house turned up no sign of her. Investigation by local police revealed that she had been exchanging texts with two men in the area, but police do not believe that is related to her disappearance. She had suffered depression. The case has been the subject of an episode of the Investigation Discovery series Disappeared. Background Kingery, a native of Northwest Indiana, met her husband Park Kingery there in the mid-1990s when the two worked together at a local drugstore. On September 20, 1994, the two were engaged. After their marriage, the couple had three children and settled down in a house they built in a wooded area of Edgefield County, South Carolina, just north of North Augusta, near where Park Kingery had gotten a job as a welder. After finishing a degree in nursing in 2001, Tammy took a job as a nurse in a local branch of the NHC Healthcare nursing home. She was still working there in September 2014. Her marriage to Kingery was strained.\\"Walk Into Darkness\\", 30‚Äì34 minutes in While her father, who still lived in Indiana, says he was not aware of any marital or psychological issues his daughter may have had at that time, her mother says the couple had grown distant from each other since their youngest son was born and had considered divorce. Tammy had an ongoing struggle with depression for which she took medication; it had led to extramarital affairs and attempts to take her own life.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 20‚Äì22 minutes in During the first weeks of September, Tammy seemed to be suffering physically‚Äîaccording to Park she had missed a few days of work, which was unlike her. She often went to bed shortly after returning from work. Park says Tammy believed no treatment would work. In the middle of that month, around September 16, Tammy began having trouble sleeping. One night she woke up sweating so severely she had to change her clothes. She confided this to her two sisters, with whom she spoke regularly. They advised her to make an appointment to see the doctor, which she did, for September 21.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 2‚Äì4 minutes in Disappearance On the morning of September 20, 2014, Tammy went to work her shift starting at 7 a.m. Her coworkers there say she was agitated about something, uncharacteristically raising her voice in conversation, and checked her own blood pressure four times, finding it high. They urged her to calm down as her agitation was keeping her heart rate high. Not too long after arriving, she called Kingery to say she was feeling a little lightheaded and wanted to come home. Since she did not feel up to driving, he picked her up, leaving her car at work, and brought her home, where she changed into her pajamas and lay down to take a nap. Around 10 a.m., he left with the couple's two sons to do some errands and give his wife the chance to rest.\\"Walk Into Darkness\\", 10 minutes in\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 28‚Äì30 minutes in Their daughter was still at the house of a friend with whom she had spent the preceding night. Kingery dropped the older son off at his mother's house so the boy could mow the lawn. He took the younger boy with him on his errands, visiting several stores where the two were seen by security cameras. When he returned to the house, the dog was outside and the door was locked. Inside they found a note from Tammy reading: \\"Gone for a walk. Be back soon. Love you.\\" Tammy was initially reported to have taken a Hard Rock Caf√© backpack with her, but that was later corrected as the backpack had been sold a week before at a yard sale. Her purse, wallet, cell phone, and keys were still inside the house.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 11‚Äì12 minutes in When he saw the note, Kingery believed right away that something was wrong. His first thought was that she had attempted to walk back to her job in order to retrieve her car. He left his sons at home and drove the route she would have taken but did not find her. He called his daughter and told her to get into a car with her friend and look for her mother; he called his mother-in-law, who came to the house right away. At the home he and his son called and searched for Tammy in the thick surrounding woods. At 2 p.m. they called the police.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 12‚Äì14 minutes in Searches and investigation Deputies from the Edgefield County Sheriff's Office responded. They, too, attempted to locate Tammy nearby but could not. Then they searched the house for any signs that a crime might have been committed; there was nothing unusual. Search dogs were given the nursing scrubs Tammy had worn to her job that morning but did not find a trail anywhere.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 14‚Äì16 minutes in The search was quickly expanded to use a South Carolina Law Enforcement Division helicopter and more deputies fanned out over a larger area around the Kingery house. They also searched a hiking trail near Interstate 20 where Tammy had often gone in the past. A notice put out for her drew reports of sightings in the Central Savannah River Area of South Carolina and Georgia around North Augusta, one of a white female walking along the interstate in Columbia County, Georgia, to the west. But by nighttime, neither Tammy nor any clues to her whereabouts had been found.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 16‚Äì18 minutes in Park, who had personally traveled as far as Atlanta looking for his wife, organized a volunteer search for her a week after her disappearance, but again the woods within 10 miles (16 km) of the house yielded nothing. Family and friends produced fliers and distributed them around the area, relying on truck drivers they knew to carry them further away. They also set up a Facebook page.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 22‚Äì24 minutes in Deep in the woods near the house, the volunteer searchers caught the scent of something that they thought was a corpse. They followed it to an abandoned wooden shack, in an area thick with briars. Inside they found sponges, gloves, and a plastic bag containing a dead dog, the source of the stench. While many of them believe the shed may have some connection to Tammy's disappearance, the sheriff's office had checked it on their original search and contend that it does not.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 26‚Äì28 minutes in However, some of the volunteers were not so easily convinced. \\"Someone went to a lot of trouble to put that dead dog there,\\" said one family friend. Even if it did have nothing to do with Tammy's disappearance, he said, it showed that there were potentially dangerous people in the vicinity of the Kingerys' house. Further attempts to search in the woods were curtailed when South Carolina's deer season began shortly afterward, making the woods unsafe. Initially, police had kept details of Tammy's depression out of their public statements on the case. They believed that merely describing her as \\"endangered\\" without saying why might help them filter out genuine tips from hoax calls and mistaken identity. But by late September, Park had made that information public, apparently hoping that people would recognize the urgency of her condition and find her. Police looked at Tammy's phone to see if anything there might help establish what she did or intended to do that day. They found two sets of text messages with other men, which they described as \\"romantic\\" in nature, that Tammy had apparently deleted prior to her disappearance. However, they investigated the two men and do not believe they had any involvement in her disappearance. Tammy shared her husband's family's enthusiasm for motorcycles, and two tips investigators received suggest one might have been involved in her disappearance. Her daughter claims to have seen her mother as the passenger on a motorcycle that passed the car she was in with her friend while they were near the family home (but were unable to locate when they turned around; later attempts by police to find it or evidence of its presence anywhere were likewise unsuccessful). A neighbor also recalls hearing a vehicle with a loud engine, possibly a motorcycle, leave the Kingerys' driveway shortly after Kingery left with his sons after seeing his wife for what has turned out to be the last time.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 18‚Äì20 minutes in Questions The circumstances of Tammy's disappearance proved particularly puzzling to her family and friends. It was very much unlike her, they told reporters, to go for walks in the woods around the house; even on the roads, as the Kingerys' neighborhood of houses on large lots was not pedestrian-friendly, and when she did do something like that she usually drove to town where better areas for walking existed. They also found it unusual that she left a note, as she almost always kept in touch with her family, friends, and coworkers via text messages. The note's concluding \\"Love you\\" also seemed to them more like something someone might say if they were expecting to be away for weeks rather than hours. It was speculated that it might not have been written by her, but several months after her disappearance the State Law Enforcement Division confirmed that it was. Another question turned on the house being locked when Kingery and his son returned. The house's main door could be locked only from the outside, with the key. Yet Tammy's keys, including the house key, were inside along with her purse, wallet, and phone, items she might have been expected to take if she were planning a longer absence. Theories and aftermath A few weeks after Tammy's disappearance, police officially stated that they believed there were \\"suspicious circumstances\\" in the case. Her family likewise believes that something unpleasant befell her. The question they and police have is what that was. \\"Unfortunately she developed a depression, and I think that's what led to her leaving\\", Kingery said to local TV station WRDW-TV a year afterward. He said Tammy would sometimes tell him she \\"needed to get away\\". According to one account she had attempted suicide two weeks before her disappearance, and it has been suggested that the disappearance was another suicide attempt that would have left her body undiscoverable. Alternatively, given the possibility that someone else may have been involved, Tammy may have been abducted or killed. \\"I've always thought maybe someone just got in the house and took her\\", Kingery said, recalling how many of her personal items were left behind. The family has asked police to search bodies of water in the area they may have bypassed before. The chief investigator on the case for the sheriff's department said in 2016 that a body would have floated to the surface by then.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 38‚Äì40 minutes in After the initial searches, police decided to thoroughly investigate Park Kingery again. His account of his actions and whereabouts on the morning Tammy disappeared was corroborated both by independent interviews with his sons, cell phone pings and security camera footage from the stores he and the younger son had visited. He also took a lie detector test, which he told Tammy's mother made him nervous. After initially telling the Curious Times podcast almost a year after Tammy's disappearance that the police told him some of the results were \\"questionable\\", he told the Investigation Discovery channel's Disappeared series in 2016 that police had asked him not to talk about it.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 32‚Äì36 minutes in Unlike other missing persons cases, there is currently no reward available for information leading to the resolution of the case. Kingery says he had to spend the $4,000 he put up to pay bills with his wife's income gone. \\"I wish I could have put out more but it's gone; that was my money out of my retirement fund\\". He later had to file for bankruptcy and might have to sell the house and move in with his parents.\\"Walk into Darkness\\", 36‚Äì38 minutes in See also * List of people who disappeared References External links * 2010s missing person cases American nurses American women nurses Missing person cases in South Carolina Edgefield County, South Carolina 2014 in South Carolina September 2014 events in the United States ","title":"Disappearance of Tammy Kingery"},{"id":"55192669","text":"Fady Nagah (born 9 May 1990) is an Egyptian football player who is currently plays for Al Mokawloon.

Description Belsar's Hill is an oval-shaped area, , enclosing . At the time of its construction, it would have constituted an island of firm soil surrounded by waterlogged fens. The defences are believed to have consisted of a single wide, ditch, and a rampart on a high bank. The hill was situated along the Aldreth Causeway, and is transected by a 19th-century track, believed to be a redirection of the original Causeway. History The location of the fortification, on the boundary between the tribal lands of the Iceni and Catuvellauni, and a similarity to other Iron Age hillforts such as Arbury Banks or Wandlebury, suggests an Iron Age provenance. It is believed that the structure was reoccupied during the Norman Conquest. During this time period the Norman forces were combating a local revolt under Hereward the Wake, and the hillfort would have been strategically located on the Aldreth Causway, the main road to Ely. A postulated name of \\"Belassise\\", from the Old French \\"bel assis\\" (meaning well seated/placed), also suggests a Norman link. An alternative suggested etymology, stemming from the Norman general named \\"Belasius\\", also suggests Norman involvement. The importance of this location in the defence of Ely has led some to suggest that the ringfort may have been the Castle of Aldreth. According to the recorded history of the revolt led by Hereward the Wake at the turn of the 11th century, Hereward's troops retreated to the Isle of Ely, surrounded by fenland which was impassable to the Norman cavalry. An attempt was made to build a mile-long causeway, but the weight of the Norman armour caused the causeway to sink. Eventually, the Norman troops bribed a local monk to show them a safe passage across the fen.

Early life and family Cuyler was born in 1697 and baptized in the New York City Dutch Church in the then Province of New York of British America. He was the oldest surviving son of twelve children born to Albany Mayor Johannes Cuyler (1661‚Äì1740) and Elsje (n√©e Ten Broeck) Cuyler (d. 1752). His father was an admitted freeman of New York City and served for 22 years as a Commissioner of Indian Affairs. His siblings included Anna Cuyler (who married Anthony Van Schaick), Christina Cuyler, Hendrick Cuyler (who died unmarried), Sara Cuyler (who married Mayor Johannes Hansen), Elsie Cuyler (who married Hendrick Johannes Rosenboom), Johannes Cuyler (who married Catherine Glen, daughter of Johannes Jacob Glen), Maria Cuyler (who married Cornelius Cuyler Ten Broeck, son of Wessel Ten Broeck), and Elizabeth Cuylter (who married Jacob Sanders Glen and were the parents of Henry Glen).

His maternal grandparents were Albany Mayor Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck and Christyna (n√©e Van Buren) Ten Broeck. Career Following his father, he became a prominent fur trader. In 1717, he served as a constable in the Second Ward. In 1724, he swore not to trade with the French and was, therefore, sent into Mohawk country and Canada to represent Albany's interests. From 1729 to 1735, he was elected and served as Alderman for the Second Ward. In 1742, Cuyler was appointed and served as the Mayor of Albany, succeeding Johannes de Peyster III who was re-nominated but did not take the oath of allegiance required of officeholders. He served from October 14, 1742 to September 28, 1746 and was himself succeed by Dirck Ten Broeck. For a total of fourteen years, he served as Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the Province of New York, appointed in 1734, 1739, 1742, 1745, 1752, and 1754, which brought him into contact with Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, both as a client and adversary. During the French and Indian War, which took place from 1754 to 1763, he was a supplier to the troops. Personal life On December 9, 1726, he was married to Catalyntie \\"Catharina\\" Schuyler (1704‚Äì1758). She was the daughter of Johannes Schuyler (1668‚Äì1747), of the prominent Schuyler family, and Elizabeth Staats (1647‚Äì1737).

On January 30, 1872, a railroad opened for cane transport from the plantations to the Central. In 1878, after its bankruptcy for a debt of more than 1 million pesos, the plant was bought by Jose Gallart. In 1880 four more Centrales operated in Puerto Rico: Luisa, San Francisco, Coloso and Can√≥vanas. In 1896, Gallart sold to Rubert Hermanos, who owned four additional plants with the Compa√±√≠a Fabi√°n, changing its name to Central San Vicente, Inc. In 1935 it had a grinding capacity of 1.500 tons daily, growing to 5,600 tons at 1958. In 1952 it achieve its greatest production, grinding 71.280 tons. San Vicente closed in 1967, after it was sold to La Corporaci√≥n Azucarera in 1972 who sold it off in pieces. Some of the machinery was sold to el ingenio la Grecia in Choluteca, Honduras. The chimney was rebuilt at 1952. Its ruins include two fireplaces, part of an oven, a crane, brick and walls, tanks and parts of a \\"Farrel\\" steam engine.

One example flew but development was ended by the Great Depression. Design and development The D-D was a mid-wing monoplane with a rectangular plan, blunt tipped, constant thickness wing. Canvas covered, it was built around a pair of wooden spars that continued through the fuselage with the pilot's seat between them. Dihedral was 1.25¬∞. Constant chord ailerons filled the outer two-thirds of the trailing edge. The wings were braced with steel V-struts, individually enclosed in wooden fairings, from the two wing spars to a framework under the fuselage where their vertices were transversely joined by a horizontal steel bar. The Invincible was designed to accept two engines of significantly different power and cost. These were the LeBlond 90-7D, a seven-cylinder radial engine or the Curtiss Challenger, a six-cylinder, two row radial. The Challenger-powered version could carry four, one more than that with the Leblond engine, but cost $7,800 rather than $5,500. The chosen engine was mounted in the nose with cylinders largely exposed for cooling; the mounting allowed easy interchange between the two types. Fuel tanks were in the wings. Behind the engine the Invincible's fuselage had a steel tube, rectangular-section structure with fabric covering. The enclosed cabin had, in the four-seater, two rows of side-by-side seats, optional dual control and generous forward, side and upward glazing. Entry was via an oval port-side door. Its tailplane, triangular in plan, was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried separate, parallel chord elevators. It was wire-braced from above and below to the rudder post of a quadrantal profile fin which carried a constant chord rudder, reaching down to the keel. The Invincible's fixed, tailwheel landing gear had mainwheels independently mounted on cranked half-axles hinged at the centre of the fuselage underside. Their outer ends were joined to the fuselage sides by inward-leaning pneumatic shock absorber struts and to the ends of the horizontal bar of the wing struttage by short drag struts. Its first flight was in late January-early February 1929 at Manitowoc, powered by the LeBlond engine and piloted by William Williams, with its designer, Irl Beach, as a passenger. It was scheduled to appear at the Detroit air show that April. Invincible, having entered into aviation in 1928 and produced three or four different prototypes, left the industry in 1929 because of the Great Depression.

Plot Spencer Yorke is a star of western films, but he has grown tired of the unreality of the movies in which he appears. He decides he wants to buy a ranch, raise cattle, and live a real life in the west. He refuses to renew his contract with his producer, Jack Kingswell, and heads home to Arizona under the assumed name of George Weston, accompanied by his film sidekick, Buckshot. The two arrive in the small town of Taylorsville, where they meet Sheriff Clem Baker, and his daughter, Mary, who is the local real estate agent. Clem's son and Mary's younger brother, Jimmy, wants to explore a nearby landmark, \\"Ghost Town\\", but Clem forbids him to go, saying it is too dangerous. Shortly after their arrival, Yorke and Buckshot save two people from some runaway horses, giving them instant local celebrity. While both Jimmy and Mary question his identity, recognizing him as the film star, Yorke denies their claims, insisting that his name is George Weston. Dubious, Mary reluctantly accepts his undercover name, but Jimmy isn't willing to let go of his desire to that he be his favorite film idol. As Yorke settles into the community, he purchases a local ranch, using Mary as his agent. While they are consummating the deal, the two also fall in love. Eventually Jimmy disobeys his father and heads over to Ghost Town. Upon his arrival he is taken prisoner by three criminals who are hiding out in the abandoned town. Knowing Jimmy is the sheriff's son, they suspect him of being sent to spy on them. They also think that Yorke isn't who he says he is, and his true identity is that of an undercover G-man. When his son fails to return, Clem heads out to the Ghost Town, where he is shot by the gangsters. Yorke and Buckshot have followed Clem, and engage the gangsters, during which Jimmy is able to escape, turning the gangsters own guns on them. Two of the crooks are killed, and Yorke knocks out the final one. After the fight, Yorke's true identity is revealed. His heroism becomes public knowledge, whereby his producer, Kingswell, offers a significantly larger salary for a new contract, which Yorke accepts. Mary agrees to marry Yorke and go to Hollywood with him, accompanied by Jimmy.

The duo began teaming in 1987, and after jumping to World Championship Wrestling in 1989 were recast as The Ding Dongs. Under this guise they would become far better known and achieve lasting notoriety, and are considered as having one of the worst wrestling gimmicks in history.  History   Deep South Championship Wrestling (1987-1988)  After working as an enhancement talent for the World Wrestling Federation, Greg Evans joined Jody Hamilton's Deep South Wrestling (DSW) promotion. It was there that he first teamed with Richard Sartain, forming the young duo of \\"The Rock 'n Roll Rebels\\". The name was derivative of several other \\"Rock n Roll\\" themed teams of the time, such as The Rock 'n Roll Express, The Midnight Rockers, The Southern Rockers, and The Rock 'n' Roll RPMs. On May 1, 1987 they would face Bad Company (The Nightmare and Steve \\"The Brawler\\" Lawler) at Ware County Junior High in Waycross, Georgia. Evans and Surtain would go on to face multiple teams within the promotion over the next two years, and were described by Greg Oliver in the 2005 book \\"The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag-Teams\\" as having \\"clicked very well. They could have been in any territory.\\" Deep South Championship wrestling would close in October 1988, leaving the Rebels in search for a new promotion.  World Championship Wrestling (1989)  In early 1989, new WCW Executive Vice President Jim Herd launched an creative initiative to compete with the more child friendly World Wrestling Federation. Perhaps inspired by the success that the formerly vicious Sheepherders had experienced in the WWF a few months earlier when they became the fun-loving Bushwhackers, Herd decided to create his own colorful team that would be geared towards children. To that effort he brought The Rock 'n Roll Rebels to World Championship Wrestling. However Sartain and Evans would not be recognizable, but would be clad in orange morph suits and covered with tiny bells. Re-designated The Ding Dongs, Evans and Sartain made their debut on June 14, 1989 at the Clash of the Champions VII televised card which was held in Fort Bragg, NC. Although Herd was expecting a strong reaction for the duo, the fan response that night was not as planned as the crowd turned virulently against them. While each took turns ringing a giant bell at ringside while the other wrestled, the crowd booed and announcer Jim Ross was noticeably embarrassed. The Ding Dongs defeated the enhancement team of Cougar Jay and George South, leaving the ring scattered with small bells and Jim Ross relieved that the match was over. Taken aback by the harsh reaction, the team's push was immediately cancelled by Jim Herd and booker Ric Flair. The gimmick had only served to alienate the company's blue collar fanbase. They immediately began a losing streak in house show matches with The New Zealand Militia (Rip Morgan and Jack Victory). Per an article in the New York Times, the team was rejected by the company's older fanbase. By the end of August the end had come for the tandem, for on the August 26th episode of WCW Worldwide they were squashed in 47 seconds by The Skyscrapers. Following the match Evans and Sartain were unmasked, and Norman the Lunatic (who was at ringside) put on one of the discarded masks. Both wrestlers would continue on briefly under their own names but would depart the promotion that fall.  Legacy  Although their prime run in WCW was short-lived, the Rock n Roll Rebels achieved lasting fame as participating in one of the worst gimmicks in wrestling history. In 1989, the Pro Wrestling Observer awarded them the title of \\"Worst Gimmick\\". The Ding Dongs are now consistently ranked among the most worst gimmicks of all time. Bill Apter's 1wrestling.com, however, has defended The Ding Dongs pointing out the team's appeal to younger wrestling fans. In 2011, The Bleacher Report ranked The Ding Dongs as the most horrible gimmick of all time. A year later Bleacher Report again listed The Ding Dongs number one, this time with the stupidest name in wrestling history. In 2016, The Sportster rated them the second worst tag-team of all-time.

In addition, there are many terms relating to advertising content, pornography and so on.  History  The founder of the site goes by the name \\"Martin Johnson\\". According to Deutsche Welle, he describes his mission as: breaking Chinese Internet censorship and creating a free Internet. The establishment of the FreeWeibo site specifically targets system-deleted posts on Sina Weibo, Twitter, and other large community websites, since around 12 percent of all posts for other Weibo platforms are removed by censors.Free Weibo ‚Äì Celebrating the Freedom of Weibo, whatsonweibo.com, May 21, 2015 Concept The United States magazine Quartz reported that one of the three founders of the site, \\"Charlie Smith\\", said out of concern about the CCP's censorship, they established in 2011 the Chinese website GreatFire with the aim to provide a resource to clearly show what was blocked. Operation \\"Martin Johnson\\" said that, like all major sites in China, Sina Weibo employs its own censors. They would manually remove content deemed sensitive, as automatic filtering cannot catch all such posts. Many comments are live for a few minutes or even hours before they are reviewed and deleted, so FreeWeibo makes use of this loophole and collect those posts. \\"Charlie Smith\\" said that they copy every Sina Weibo post, but this approach requires a huge storage capacity. According to the Deutche Welle report, to access the FreeWeibo page from within China, people must use VPN software to bypass the authorities. FreeWeibo gathers data directly from Sina Weibo as well as from WeiboScope, which is a project by the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong. Objectives In the Quartz report, \\"Charlie Smith\\" expected to defeat the censorship system with FreeWeibo. He said he would continue to pressure the Chinese government until they give up the practice.

The highway will link Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya to Mombasa, the largest seaport of the country. The new highway is expected to cut travel times between the two cities from the current 6 to 10 hours to approximately four hours. Location The road starts at Gitaru along the Nairobi‚ÄìNakuru Highway, approximately , northeast of Nairobi City centre. It continues in a general southeasterly direction, through Ngong, Ongata Rongai, Kisaju and Isinya to rejoin the existing Nairobi‚ÄìMombasa Road, just north of Konza. The highway passes through nine Kenya counties to end in the city of Mombasa at the Changamwe Roundabout, a total distance of about . The coordinates of this road at Kibwezi are: 02¬∞25'04.0\\"S, 37¬∞57'39.0\\"E (Latitude:-2.417778; Longitude:37.960833). Overview The planned expressway is a dual-carriage motorway with initially four lanes, expandable to six lanes in the future. The road will be capable of supporting sustained traffic speeds of up to per hour and will have controlled access. The expressway is intended to serve as \\"a central part of the national and regional transport system, helping promote trade and development in Kenya\\" and the regional neighbors of Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and South Sudan. History In February 2015, the Kenyan government hired PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to conduct a feasibility study on the commercial and technical viability of the Nairobi‚ÄìMombasa Expressway. The PwC report indicated the highway was viable if the highway operator collected a toll that would be used to retire the private capital used to develop the expressway. Starting about that time as well, the government of Kenya, through the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), began detailed talks with Bechtel International on a public-private partnership (PPP) to design, fund, construct and operate the highway. Construction costs The cost of constructing this expressway is budgeted at US$2.1 billion. Funding is expected from the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, also from the USA. Timetable In August 2017, KeNHA signed a binding agreement with Betchel International, an American civil engineering and construction company to design, construct, and operate the proposed expressway. The expressway will be developed in 10 sections and is designed to have 19 interchanges. Construction is expected to start in July 2018. Completion of the first section is expected in October 2019, with the entire expressway expected to open in 2024. In April 2019, the Business Daily newspaper reported that construction is expected to start in the second half of calendar year 2019.

On 2 June, 1968, the recreation hall of the Loran station at Adak, Alaska, started to burn. After Poroo and other men escaped from the burning building, he re- entered it when he thought he heard cries for help. After he had been terribly burned, a head count determined that no one was missing. A Coast Guard account of the event records that, even though he was horribly burned himself, Poroo guided uninjured men in how to properly care for those who had been burned. Poroo died on June 18, 1968. Legacy A posthumous Coast Guard Medal was awarded to Poroo. In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the Coast Guard's most senior non-commissioned officer, proposed that all 58 cutters in the Sentinel class should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism.

Joe \\"Little Joe\\" Monahan (1850‚Äì1904), born Johanna Monahan, was an American businessman who worked in various prospecting and cattle industries around Silver City, Idaho, under an assumed masculine name and identity. The revelation of Joe's sex became a sensationalized national news story after his death in 1904. His life was the subject of the 1993 film The Ballad of Little Jo. Early life \\"Little Joe Monahan,\\" born Johanna Monahan, c. 1870s Monahan is believed to have been born as Johanna Monahan in Buffalo, New York, in 1850, and to have moved to Idaho in 1867. Raised in a foster home from the age of eight, Monahan left for the West at 14 years old. Because his identity was obscured until his death in 1904, the circumstances of his birth are unclear, and census records suggest he may have been born as Mary Manumon, though the family also had a young servant girl, Johanna Burke. Accounts to journalists after his death claimed that Monahan's mother dressed the young child in boy's clothing in early childhood to sell newspapers on the street. As Joe Monahan Monahan had spent his early years in Idaho as a cowboy, and briefly lived in Oregon before returning to Owyhee County, where an 1898 census listed him as a cattle rancher. Monahan was said to have worked in the livery business, then a sawmill, and later saved several thousand dollars in mining, which were stolen in an investment fraud. Monahan voted in an 1880 Republican primary despite women being denied the vote at the time. Monahan lived on Succor Creek, near Silver City, in a small home with dirt floors, raising pigs and chickens. He is listed in three Idaho census inquiries. All identified Monahan as a male, with one marked with an asterisk with the remark \\"doubtful sex.\\" Locals remarked that they were aware that Monahan was female, but Monahan never confirmed it when questioned, and the issue was rarely raised. In a letter to the Buffalo police chief seeking next of kin, a local resident remarked that, \\"He had fought his way through with many of us ... suffered hardship and hunger in early days and never whimpered ... the cowboys treated him with the greatest respect, and he was always welcome to eat and sleep at their camps.\\" Monahan fell ill in 1903 after a winter cattle drive on the Boise River and died in 1904. At this point, townspeople discovered his sex, which was widely reported in the media of the day including an expos√© in the American Journal Examiner. Media Monahan's story became a popular story in Western magazines starting in the 1950s. Barbara Lebow wrote a play, Little Joe Monaghan, in 1981. In 1993, a movie, The Ballad of Little Jo, was loosely based on Monahan's life story. References Further reading * Horan, James D., Desperate Women (G.P.

Pseudo-Orpheus appears in multiple recensions (versions created over time). The poem presents the legendary Greek figure Orpheus as giving a poetic speech to his son, Musaeus, identified as the biblical Moses, passing on to him hidden wisdom he learned in Egypt. It presents a monotheistic view of God, whom, according to the poem, no one has seen, except for Abraham, who was able to see God due to his skill at astrology. Although preserved in Christian writers, most scholars believe that it is \\"of Jewish authorship.\\" Over time, a number of Christian and Jewish authors reworked Greek traditions about Orpheus and used them to support their monotheistic views and to assert the religious supremacy of Moses and monotheism over Greek polytheistic views. The rhetorical device of using legendary non-monotheistic figures to endorse Judaism is likewise found in the Sibylline Oracles. \\"Pseudo-Orpheus\\" is also sometimes applied to the unknown writer of other works falsely attributed to Orpheus. Preserved versions The following are the primary forms of Pseudo-Orpheus that have survived to the present. The exact dating of the various recensions is disputed. The first extant writer who quotes the work is Clement of Alexandria, who lived about 150-215 CE.On Clement as the first to quote it, see On the birth and death dates for Clement, see Clement provides \\"numerous short quotations\\" from Pseudo-Orpheus; one (abbreviated C2) matching the edition of Eusebius, and the rest, collectively known as C1, mostly but not exclusively in agreement with the version of the poem known as J (see below). The recension which appears in Eusebius (abbreviated E) seems to have been produced in the second or first century BCE.On the recension in general, On the name \\"E\\", Eusebius claims to have taken the poem from the writings of Aristobulus of Alexandria, a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher who lived in the second century BCE. This version is known as the Mosaic recension because of its focus on Moses. This version is variously counted at either forty one or forty-six lines of hexameter verse. A shorter recension appears in the works of an author referred to as Pseudo-Justin (approximately or at some unknown point before 300 CE) who is so called because his original name is not known, although he was for a time confused with the second-century writer Justin Martyr. This version contains 21 lines and is referred to as J. Another recension, known as T, or the \\"Theosophical\\" recension, contains all the lines found in the other versions of the poem, and mostly agrees with E. This version is found in the T√ºbingen Theosophy or Theosophy of T√ºbingen, \\"an epitome of a late-fifth century collection of oracles\\". External links The recension in Eusebius (E) can be found in Book XIII of Eusebius' Praeparatio Evangelica (Preparation for the Gospel), as translated in 1903 by E. H. Gifford. Within the HTML file, Pseudo-Orpheus is found in chapter 12, and consists of the first indented section of the chapter, from the words \\"I speak to those who lawfully may hear\\" to the words \\"store this doctrine in thine heart.\\" The recension in Pseudo-Justin (J) can be found chapter 2 of Pseudo-Justin's De Monarchia in the poetic section which begins with the words, \\"I'll speak to those who lawfully may hear\\" and ending with the words, \\"The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.\\" The translation is by G.

Biography  Lidin was born Vladimir Gomberg to a Russianized Jewish family in Moscow. His father owned an export business. He attended the Larazev Institute of Oriental Languages and Moscow University, from where he graduated in 1915 with a degree in law. Owing inspiration to the Russian neorealists and to Western writers such as Guy de Maupassant, he published his first short story in 1908 and by 1912 he was contributing stories to different magazines and newspapers. In 1916 he published his first collection of prose, under the nihilistic title \\"Tryn-trava\\", which translates as \\"nothing matters\\". During the First World War, Lidin fought on the eastern front. During the subsequent Russian Civil War, he joined the side of the Red Army and served in eastern Siberia. His experience in these conflicts served as inspiration for two short stories collections that were published in 1923: Daily Humdrum and Tales of Many Days. After the war he traveled widely in Western Europe and the Middle East, before returning to Moscow, where he became one of the most visible Soviet writers of the 1920s. During this period he published about 20 books, including short and long fiction, travel literature and essays. His big international break came in 1931, when his 1927 novel The Apostate was published in English and several other European languages and brought him international recognition. In the United States, the novel was published in 1932 under the title \\"The Price of Life\\". During this time, he was travelling so extensively that he was considered to have \\"resided partly abroad\\". His writing style became more streamlined in the 1930s, with the social message of his writing becoming more obvious. His best known works of this period were Fishing Time (1930), About the Far East (1932), and the novel The Great, or the Pacific (1933), written after a trip to the Far East and all devoted to building of a new life on Russia's eastern frontier. After Russia's entry into World War II, Lidin worked as a war reporter for the Russian daily Izvestia between 1941 and 1942, documenting the first year of the German invasion in a collection of essays published under the name Winter of 1941. During this time he also wrote an essay titled \\"Talnoe\\", about the extermination of Jews by the Nazi Army in the Ukraine, that was included in The Black Book: The Nazi Crime Against the Jewish People, a collection of testimonies and first-hand accounts of the perpetuation of the Holocaust, which was used as evidence during the Nuremberg Trials, but was never published in the Soviet Union. Joseph Stalin's displeasure with one of his reportages made Lidin fall out of favour with the Soviet authorities. He was demoted to a position at a regional military newspaper and between 1943 and 1946 there he had no works published, a significant gap in his otherwise prolific and constant output. It wasn't until the late 1940s that he was once again able to publish his work. Other than earlier writings who were only now published ‚Äì most importantly, the novel Exile, dealing with the first two years of the Nazi invasion, written in 1942 and published in 1947 ‚Äì his writings wore mostly conformist. After the death of Stalin, he was offered a string of prominent positions in the Union of Soviet Writers and taught at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute. In 1957 he published the literary memoir People and Meetings. He continued to write and publish for the rest of his life. He died in 1979, in Moscow at the age of 85. Renewed interest for his work in the post-Soviet era lead to his unpublished notebooks from the 1970s being published in 1991.

L/60 was a German anti-aircraft gun built during the 1930s and used by Germany in limited numbers during the Second World War. Although not produced in great numbers its features were further developed in the 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41 series of guns. History After the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I Germany faced a prohibition on new weapons development imposed by the Versailles treaty. However, Krupp sidestepped these restrictions by opening foreign subsidiaries or by entering into joint- development agreements with companies such as Bofors to develop a new anti- aircraft gun. The development of the gun was secretly funded by the Reichswehr and in 1925 Krupp acquired a controlling interest in Bofors and a team of German experts was sent to Sweden. The resulting gun the Bofors 75 mm Model 1929 proved adequate for the Swedes, but trials of 7.5 cm Flak. L/60 proved unsatisfactory and the Germans requested a heavier design. The 75 mm was then modified to include a larger caliber barrel, which was further developed into the 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41, one of the best-known AA guns of World War II. Despite German unwillingness to buy the 75 mm variant, Bofors decided to start serial production anyway and the Bofors 75 mm Model 1929 proved an export success. Krupp also began production of the 7.5 cm Flak. L/60 for foreign customers such as Brazil and Spain. At the outbreak of war in 1939 undelivered guns were seized and assigned to the Kriegsmarine who employed them as coastal artillery and anti-aircraft guns.

It was located near Korsv√§gen, on the site that currently is the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre. Walhalla IP was in use between 1908 and 1921.  History  Walhalla IP was built by √ñrgryte IS in 1908 to replace their old stadium Balders Hage as the Swedish Football Association had banned international football on it. The city deeded land to √ñrgryte IS for this purpose, which today is used by the Swedish Exhibition and Congress Centre, opposite to amusement park Liseberg. The roofed main stand had 1,200 seats, and another 6,800 spectators could be accommodated on terraces around the pitch. The stadium was modelled after Liverpool F.C.'s Anfield. At the time of its opening, Walhalla IP was the most modern stadium in Scandinavia. The pitch was enclosed by a slightly longer than 400 metre running track and other athletics facilities, and several Swedish athletics championships were held in the stadium. The inauguration match was played on 6 September 1908, between √ñrgryte and German champions Viktoria Berlin. It was the main venue for sports events in Sweden until Stockholm Olympic Stadium was opened in 1912. The Swedish national team played its first ever international against England national football team on Walhalla IP in September 1908, and IFK G√∂teborg‚Äîthat rented the stadium from √ñrgryte IS‚Äîwon their two first Swedish championships, in 1908 and 1910, there. In 1912, the stadium was the scene of one of the first known instances of Swedish football hooliganism. IFK G√∂teborg supporters stormed the pitch to get to the referee, who had first awarded IFK a penalty kick against √ñrgryte IS in the last minute of the match, but then blown the final whistle before the kick could be taken. IFK G√∂teborg left Walhalla IP for newly built Ullevi in 1916. The land on which Walhalla IP stood was chosen as one of the sites for the 1923 Gothenburg Tercentennial Jubilee Exposition, and √ñrgryte IS was forced to move from the stadium as a consequence. The last event at Walhalla was an international sports gala arranged by √ñrgryte and held on 25 September 1921.

Ripe studied engineering and political sciences in Z√ºrich, Bern and Darmstadt.http://www.hls-dhs- dss.ch/textes/d/D43421.php From 1918 he worked as an electrical engineer in Switzerland and the USA. In 1931 he received his Ph.D. From 1932 to 1939 he was the director of the Bernese Office for the Promotion of New Industries, working as an advisory engineer. From 1933 onwards, he was a political economist for the Fascist National Front and from 1938 to 1939 Chairman of the Board of the newspaper, Neue Basler Zeitung. In July 1940, after the defeat of France against Germany, Kellermann and his fellow-citizens came to the hope of an upsurge of right-wing forces, the so-called ‚Äò‚ÄôFrontsfr√ºhling‚Äô‚Äô, a term used by Swiss fascists to describe the predicted surge in fascism. The Swiss President, Marcel Pilet-Golaz, welcomed Keller and the leader of the ESAP, Ernst Hofmann, to an official meeting. On 10 October 1940, under the leadership of Klaus H√ºgel in Munich, a conference was held with the leaders of the front, Hans Oehler and Benno Schaeppi of the confederation of loyal confederates of the Socialist Weltanschauung (BTE), Ernst Burri and Arthur Leonhardt of the Swiss Society of Friends of an Authoritarian Democracy (SGAD) were in attendance. Keller represented the NSB in the conference. Keller was supported by Rudolf Hess, as the new head of the National Movement of Switzerland (NBS). The group demanded closer ties with Nazi Germany, and other radical steps such as calling for the elimination of the bourgeois newspapers of Switzerland and the expulsion of the League of Nations from Switzerland. On 19 November 1940 the Federal Council banned the NBS, citing fear of German annexation. On 10 June 1941 the Swiss Federal Prosecutor led a blow against the illegal activities of the NBS. Keller was arrested. For lack of evidence, he was released on bail, whereupon he left Switzerland in November 1941 for Germany, where he became director of the Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring in Berlin and in Weimar. He produced brought experience from the Swiss electricity industry. In 1944 he tried to unite the opposing national socialist societies abroad as a federation of Swiss national socialists. After the war, Keller returned to Switzerland and was condemned to a total of 14 years for breaching military secrets and attacking the independence of the Swiss Confederation.

Lasting from late August to mid-September 2017, the storm was the strongest open-Atlantic tropical cyclone on record and the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the Leeward Islands. Classified as the ninth named storm, fourth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Irma developed from a tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands on August 30\\\\. Favorable conditions allowed the cyclone to become a hurricane on the following day and then rapidly intensify into a major hurricane by September 1 as it moved generally westward across the Atlantic. However, dry air and eyewall replacement cycles disrupted further strengthening, with fluctuations in intensity during the next few days. Irma resumed deepening upon encountering warmer sea surface temperatures, while approaching the Lesser Antilles on September 4\\\\. The system reached Category 5 intensity on the following day and peaked with winds of 180 mph (285 km/h) shortly thereafter. Irma made its first landfall on Barbuda early on September 6 at peak intensity. The hurricane also struck Saint Martin and Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands at Category 5 intensity later that day. Upon clearing the Leeward Islands, the cyclone continued west-northwestward toward the Bahamas. Around the time of landfall on Little Inagua Island early on September 8, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane, after being a Category 5 hurricane for about 60 consecutive hours, the second longest contiguous time period as a Category 5 hurricane on record. Late on September 8, the storm re-intensified to Category 5 southwest of Ragged Island. Irma made landfall near Cayo Romano, Cuba, at that intensity, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane to strike the island since 1924. Although land interaction weakened Irma to a high-end Category 2 hurricane, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida, before making landfall on Cudjoe Key on September 10\\\\. Irma weakened to Category 3 status prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day. The system degraded into a remnant low over Alabama, and ultimately dissipated on September 13 over Missouri. Irma caused widespread devastation in the Caribbean, with a total of $27.16 billion (2017 USD) in damages and 27 deaths being attributed to the hurricane accumulative of all affected areas in the Caribbean. The hurricane was the costliest to ever impact the state of Florida, with at least $50 billion in damages and 92 fatalities left behind by the storm. With damages totaling to $77.16 billion (2017 USD), Irma is the fourth-costliest tropical cyclone on record. Formation and initial rapid intensification Tropical Storm Irma shortly after formation on August 30 The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave over western Africa on August 26. The tropical wave, which was producing a large area of deep convection, moved off the coast of the continent late on August 27. Throughout the next two days, showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low-pressure area, as the system passed just south of and then through the Cape Verde Islands on August 29; the NHC stated that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression. With satellite imagery indicating that a well-defined circulation developed by early on August 30, it was estimated that the system developed into the tenth tropical depression of the season at 00:00 UTC while situated about west-southwest of S√£o Vicente in the Cape Verde Islands. Shortly after forming, the banding features associated with the depression increased, and the depression intensified slightly, becoming Tropical Storm Irma at 06:00 UTC. The NHC operationally began advisories at 15:00 UTC that day, with cyclone already at tropical storm status, based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates. Strengthening was anticipated due to warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear, and only slightly cooler waters and drier air were foreseen as a hindrance to intensification. Moving westward due to a mid-level ridge over the eastern Atlantic, the nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow, as an anticyclone became established over the system, with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images. Early on August 31, a central dense overcast (CDO) and an eye feature developed, indicating that Irma intensified into a Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC, only 30 hours after tropical cyclogenesis. The mid-level ridge to the north weakened slightly late on August 31, resulting in the storm curving west-northwestward. Irma underwent rapid intensification after reaching hurricane status, becoming a Category 2 hurricane at 18:00 UTC and then a Category 3 hurricane, becoming a major hurricane - around 00:00 UTC on September 1\\\\. In a 48-hour period, the hurricane's intensity had increased by 65 mph (105 km/h), a feat achieved only by about 1-in-30 Atlantic tropical cyclones. Hurricane Irma during an eyewall replacement cycle on September 2 On September 2, a ship passed to the west of the center of Irma, recording maximum winds of , while hurricane-force winds were estimated to have extended up to from the center, both of which indicated that the inner core of Irma remained compact. After being a major hurricane for about 30 hours, the system weakened slightly to a strong Category 2 hurricane at 12:00 UTC on September 2, likely as a result of drier air and eyewall replacement cycles, with the eye sometimes becoming obscured and the deep convection lining the eyewall appearing weaker. During this time, Irma began moving west-southwestward under the influence of a strong high pressure area to the north. The first aircraft reconnaissance flight into the hurricane occurred early on September 4; during the mission, an eye in diameter and surface winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) were observed. Although the NHC operationally considered Irma to be a Category 3 hurricane at that time, post- analysis indicated that the storm was still at Category 2 status. Peak intensity and the Caribbean islands Hurricane Irma near peak intensity approaching the Leeward Islands on September 5 Irma re-intensified into a Category 3 hurricane at 12:00 UTC on September 3 as it moved southwestwards under the influence of the ridge. Beginning early the following day, the eye began increasing in size and improving in appearance, while deep convection surrounding the eye became more symmetrical. Additionally, the hurricane headed into warmer sea surface temperatures as it approached the Leeward Islands. As a result, Irma underwent another period of rapid intensification, reaching Category 4 intensity at 18:00 UTC on September 4 and Category 5 at 12:00 UTC on September 5. The extremely powerful hurricane grew in size and became increasingly symmetric, with mesovortices being observed within the well-defined eye, signaling the continued intensification of the storm. Sustained winds peaked at 180 mph (285 km/h) near 18:00 UTC on September 5 ‚Äì although it was operationally assessed at 185 mph (295 km/h). Early on September 6, the storm reached its minimum barometric pressure of just before 06:00 UTC, an estimate based on a dropsonde surface pressure observation and measurements from Barbuda and Saint Barth√©lemy. This was the lowest barometric pressure in the Atlantic since Dean in 2007. Infrared satellite loop of Irma passing south of the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 8 Irma made landfall along the northern coast of Barbuda around 05:45 UTC on September 6, at peak intensity; Irma maintained its peak until 12:00 UTC on September 6. After crossing the island of Barbuda, the hurricane, which maintained its intensity and impressive satellite appearance, struck Saint Martin at 11:15 UTC on September 6 and later Virgin Gorda at 16:30 UTC with winds of 180 mph (285 km/h), though Irma' pressure had risen slightly by the time of its third landfall in Virgin Gorda. As the hurricane moved away from the Virgin Islands late on September 6, observations from reconnaissance flights indicated that the cyclone weakened and had concentric eyewalls, while a Doppler radar in San Juan, Puerto Rico, also noted a double eyewall. However, Irma remained a Category 5 hurricane and the wind field expanded. Late on September 6, the cyclone passed about north of Puerto Rico. Moving west-northwestward, Irma closely paralleled the northern coast of Hispaniola throughout the day on September 7. By late that day however, an eyewall replacement cycle began to take place within the hurricane; reconnaissance aircraft found an elliptical eye later that day, though the wind field continued to expand. As a consequence of this internal structure change, Irma weakened to a Category 4 hurricane as it passed south of the Turks and Caicos Islands early on September 8. This subsequently ended the 60-hour contiguous period of Irma maintaining Category 5 intensity, the second longest any Atlantic storm had maintained winds above ‚Äì only the 1932 Cuba hurricane had lasted for a longer consecutive time period at that intensity, at 78 hours. The Bahamas and Cuba Hurricane Irma approaching Cuba late on September 8, shortly after it regained Category 5 strength At 05:00 UTC, early on September 8, the eye of Irma made landfall on the island of Little Inagua in the Bahamas, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a central pressure of . The hurricane then began tracking more to the west due to the intensification of a subtropical ridge to its north. Once the eyewall replacement cycle was completed, Irma began to re- intensify, and it re-attained Category 5 intensity at 18:00 UTC that day east of Cuba, as deep convection became more pronounced and organized. The hurricane then made landfall in Cayo Romano, Cuba, at 03:00 UTC on September 9, at Category 5 intensity, with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) and a central pressure identical to its previous landfall. This made Irma only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike Cuba in recorded history, after the 1924 Cuba hurricane ‚Äì both had identical wind speeds at landfall. As the eye of Irma moved along the northern coast of Cuba, gradual weakening ensued due to land interaction, with the eye becoming cloud-filled and the intensity falling to a high-end Category 2 later on September 9 ‚Äì operationally, it had been assessed as never falling below 120 mph (195 km/h), though it was lowered in post- analysis, possibly due to shoaling interfering with reconnaissance data. By later that night, the forward speed of Irma had begun to slow down, which allowed it to finally begin moving northwestward towards Florida in response to a complex steering pattern, which involved Irma moving around the southwestern edge of the subtropical high to its northeast and a low-pressure system that was located over the continental United States. Moving over the Florida Straits which contained sea surface temperatures of near , allowed Irma to quickly restrengthen, and re-attain Category 4 intensity at 06:00 UTC on September 10 while located about from Key West, Florida, as deep convection improved and the eye becoming better defined. By this time, the NHC anticipated Irma would maintain its intensity before making landfall in the state of Florida later that day. In addition, Irma's wind field continued to increase in size, with hurricane-force winds spanning out a region of and gale-force winds spanning in diameter. Florida landfalls and demise Radar loop of Irma making landfall in the Florida Keys on September 10 Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key, Florida at 13:00 UTC on September 10 at Category 4 intensity, with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a central pressure of . This made Irma the first Category 4 hurricane to strike Florida since Hurricane Charley in 2004. In addition, Irma's landfall in the Florida Keys marked the first time on record two Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S. within the same season ‚Äì with Hurricane Harvey having made landfall at roughly the same intensity in Texas just over two weeks prior. Increasing wind shear and land interaction caused the satellite appearance of the storm to become ragged later that day, and Irma weakened to Category 3 intensity before making its seventh and final landfall at 19:30 UTC in Marco Island, Florida, with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) and a central pressure of . Once Irma had moved inland, it began to accelerate to the north-northwest, while rapid weakening began to occur due to the increasing wind shear, land interaction, and dry air, with the storm falling below Category 3 intensity hours after landfall. Passing east of Tampa as a weakening Category 1 hurricane around 06:00 UTC on September 11, Irma continued to weaken as most of the deep convection became more spread out towards the northern semi-circle of the circulation ‚Äì though it retained a large wind field, with most of Florida experiencing gale-force winds. Irma finally weakened to a tropical storm around 12:00 UTC that day as it entered southern Georgia and began its transition to a post-tropical cyclone. At 06:00 UTC on September 12, Irma degenerated to a remnant low just as it entered Alabama, as most of the deep convection had dissipated. The remnants persisted for another day or so before dissipating on September 13.

R. Atherton, H. T. Openshaw and A. R. Todd. These described the reaction for the first time in 1945 as a method of converting dialkyl phosphites into dialkyl chlorophosphates. The diacyl chlorophosphates formed are often too reactive to be isolated, though. For this reason, the synthesis of phosphates or phosphoramidates can follow the Atherton-Todd reaction in the presence of alcohols or amines. The following equation gives an overview over the Atherton-Todd reaction using the reactant dimethyl phosphite as an example: Atherton-Todd-Reaktion The reaction takes place after the addition of tetrachloromethane and a base. This base is usually a primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Instead of methyl groups other alkyl or benzyl groups may be present.  Reaction mechanism  A possible reaction mechanism for the Atherton-Todd reaction is presented here for the example of dimethylphosphite, just like in the overview reaction: Erster Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Atherton-Todd-Reaktion First, a tertiary amine is used to cleave a methyl group of dimethyl phosphite. The intermediate 1 results from this reaction step. Zweiter Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Atherton-Todd-Reaktion Subsequently, the intermediate 1 deprotonates the starting compound dimethylphosphite, so that intermediates 2a and intermediates 2b are formed. The intermediate 1 is then regenerated from the intermediate 2a. Dritter Teil des Reaktionsmechanismus der Atherton-Todd- Reaktion Finally, intermediate 2b is chlorinated by tetrachloromethane and dimethyl chlorophosphate 3 is formed.  Possible subsequent reactions  After the synthesis of the dimethyl chlorophosphate, a further reaction (for example with a primary amine like aniline) is possible by the following reaction equation: Weiterer Reaktionsverlauf durch Zugabe von Anilin  Atom economy  In this reaction, in addition to the starting compound dialkyl phosphite, tetrachloromethane and a base (an amine) are used in stoichiometric amounts. Only chloroform, which occurs after two reaction steps from tetrachloromethane, is relevant as a waste product for the assessment of the atomic economy. It should furthermore be kept in mind that the product of the reaction has a greater molar mass than the starting compound. The atom economy of this reaction can therefore be classified as relatively good.  See also  The Atherton-Todd reaction is related to the Appel reaction. In it, tetrachloromethane is used for chlorination as well.

He was known for the innovative technics he developed and diversity of styles he applied to his artwork. His artistic legacy provides a rich insight into the art movements that took place in Argentina from the 1950s through the 1970s.  Education & career Roberto Lucio Pignataro graduated from Escuela de Bellas Artes Manuel Belgrano as a Professional Illustrator in 1955 and as a Teacher of Visual Arts in 1958. He also obtained a degree as Professor in Painting at Escuela Nacional de Artes Visuales Prilidiano Pueyrred√≥n in 1961. Some of Pignataro's notable art teachers were: Aurelio Macci and H√©ctor Jos√© Cartier. Roberto Lucio Pignataro held 28 art exhibitions during his lifetime: 27 in Buenos Aires, Argentina and one in Miami, Florida, and participated in two collective art exhibitions: \\"Los Pintores Argentinos in Radio Nacional\\" in 1959 and ‚ÄúCollages‚Äù in 1982. He also published three books featuring experimental art techniques.  Artistic styles and techniques  Pignataro's work was often described by critics as Informalism, Lyrical abstraction, having an oriental influence, and hard to categorize. Other influences that can be observed throughout his work are from Cubism, De Stijl, Geometric Abstraction, Japanese Ink Wash Painting, Gestural Abstraction, Tachisme, Abstract Expresionism and Abstract Calligraphy. His artwork most commonly features oil painting, paper collage, and assemblage techniques, all of which he often combined into texture-rich art pieces.

Tooth and Tail was released in September 2017 for Windows, MacOS, Linux and PlayStation 4. The game is set in a society of anthropomorphic animals during a time of severe food shortages, resulting in the uprising of political parties with differing ideologies regarding the acquisition of food. The gameplay consists of single-player and multiplayer modes and supports gamepads and keyboard and mouse arrangements. Players begin by choosing six units out of a pool of twenty to use during the match. Once each player has chosen, the goal is to destroy the enemy's resources through building structures and creating units. Each player controls a commander rather than having a top-down view. Development of Tooth and Tail began towards the end of development for Monaco. Various real-time strategy (RTS) games were prototyped before the game, then titled Armada, was announced in March 2014. The premise was to create an RTS game without micromanagement or the necessity of high quantities of actions per minute. From the outset, the game was designed to work well on both gamepads and keyboard-and-mouse setups. In August 2014, the game's title was changed to Lead to Fire before being finally changed to Tooth and Tail, a reference to the tooth-to-tail ratio, in August 2015. Before its official release, the game's developers proposed a launch on Steam's Early Access platform, though this did not occur. The game was positively received and won two awards in 2016; \\"Best Character Design\\" at Intel Level Up and tied with Giant Cop for \\"Guest's Pick\\" at Media Indie Exchange. The single-player mode was not praised as highly as the multiplayer modes; reviewers said the difficulty spikes impaired enjoyment. Many comparisons with other games and media were made; mostly with the novel series Redwall and the novella Animal Farm.  Plot  Tooth and Tail is set during the 19th century in a society where anthropomorphic animals are facing chronic food shortages. Many animals decided to resort to cannibalism to overcome the shortage. The Civilized, led by Archimedes, created a lottery system that ultimately controlled who was eaten. This way of life sparked controversy throughout the nation; the Commonfolk liked neither the idea of being eaten nor the high cost of food. The son of the wealthy merchant Bellafide was selected to be eaten; he revolted, intending to reshape the food-selection system into one based on some version of a meritocracy. The Commonfolk‚Äîled by Hopper who wanted to impose a voting system to replace the lottery‚Äîalso revolted. To overthrow the Civilized, Hopper and Bellafide joined forces despite their different ideals. The Civilized engaged in the fight to maintain power and the status quo. Though the revolution had thrown the leadership into general chaos, certain military elements remained organized. Quartermaster, the shady and pragmatic head of the late Tsarina's K.S.R secret police, seized control of military elements and supported Archimedes and the Civilized for the time being. Towards the end of the game, the pigs, who are dying out from the war, tell the four armies they had relayed false information to the three other armies, tricking them into gathering in one location. As the armies fight each other to the point of destruction, the pigs revolt, revealing they had a plan to overthrow the Tsarina and get revenge for the slavery and eating of their kind. A horde of pigs then ambushes the final standing army, destroying it and leaving the fate of the commanders and the rest of the meat- eating animals ambiguous. Gameplay Tooth and Tail is a real-time strategy video game designed for use with gamepads and keyboard-and-mouse setups. The game has single-player and multiplayer modes. In the single-player mode, the player progresses through the story by completing levels of increasing difficulty. Each level features objectives with varying degrees of onerousness, depending on the player's advancement. To complete each level, the basic objectives must be met while \\"heroic\\" ones‚Äîusually more arduous‚Äîare optional. Multiplayer mode can be accomplished through ranked or unranked online matchmaking and local multiplayer split screen. Up to four players may play at once, either as teams of two or compete to be the last one standing. Before a match begins, players must choose a commander from four factions and then draft six units from a pool of twenty to use during the match. Fifteen of these units are offensive and tiered depending on their strength and cost. The other five units are defensive. All choices are final; other units cannot be unlocked during the match. Once all players have chosen their units, they control a commander of an army and must build structures, such as farms, to gather required resources. Most structures can only be built near gristmills, preventing players from building near enemies while scouting or spying. At any time, players can burrow their commanders back to allow them to create structures. Units are produced at structures called warrens, assuming the player has sufficient food to summon the desired units. Depending on the tier, some units cost more than others. Food is a limited resource, meaning players must strategize their attack in advance. Structures called campfires act as a combination of gristmills and farms, allowing structures to be built near them while also producing food. To win, the player must destroy the enemy's gristmills and campfires. The map is procedurally generated, implying each player will have different advantages and disadvantages each match.  Development Following the success of Pocketwatch Games' 2013 video game Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine, the development of Tooth and Tail was announced on March 11, 2014. The game was loosely based on a design Andy Schatz, the founder of Pocketwatch Games, and roommate Tom Wexler had made during college, called Dino Drop. As with the development of Monaco, many games with similar mechanics were prototyped. Schatz told Jim Rossignol of Rock, Paper, Shotgun about Dino Drop, which he described as \\"a split-screen strategy game with autonomous units\\". Schatz and co-designer Andy Nguyen heavily developed this version of real-time strategy towards the end of Monacos development. Originally developed under the working title Armada‚Äîstylized as [ARMADA]‚Äîthe game was advertised as a real-time strategy (RTS) game without the necessary micromanagement and high quantity of actions per minute, an issue he attributed to the Starcraft series; Starcraft and Command & Conquer were credited as influences on Tooth and Tail. Armada was developed to appeal to people who did not usually play RTS games but also had the ability to \\"play [the] game at a deep level\\". The game was designed to be controller and gamepad friendly; Schatz implied there had been no \\"good\\" RTS games that utilized them. Schatz compared Armada with Monaco, saying \\"I want to do the thing with RTS that we did with Monaco, with the stealth genre, and that's constrain the control set in order to make the actual, physical interaction easy to pick up without limiting the complexity of the game itself\\". He pitched this idea to around forty people at the Game Developers Conference to positive feedback. At this point, there was no timeframe for development and no definite specifics (such as the title, theme, and style). Screenshot of Tooth and Tail when it was titled LEADtoFIRE The game's title was later changed to Lead to Fire‚Äîstylized as LEADtoFIRE‚Äîin August 2014. Throughout these stages of development, Pocketwatch Games streamed their progress on the streaming platform Twitch. This was described as a \\"miniature PAX\\"; a way to show off the development and allow fans to play test the game. It was around this time that the game drew inspiration from Hearthstone, a card game in which players build decks and compete against others. Schatz noted there would be around thirty units and structures to choose from, and while there was yet to be a definitive number, it was estimated players would be able to choose six-to-eight of them per match. Polygon reported a tentative release date of \\"sometime in 2015\\" In August 2015, the game received its official name; Tooth and Tail. The change was attributed to Lead to Fire not boding well with the developers, and believing no one knew how to properly pronounce it. The title is a reference to the tooth-to-tail ratio; the art style was revealed at the same time as the official title. Schatz wrote that like SpyParty, \\"the game should look utterly shitty until it‚Äôs absolutely amazing\\". The art style was described as a modernized version of 1990s pixel art. Having released the official artwork, the development process became more public and the team believed the game would be released in late 2016, with the possibility of using Steam's Early Access platform. Interviewer: Thank you for showing me Tooth and Tail, that game looks amazing. And when can we expect to get that? Andy Schatz: So this game's gonna be out later this year. We don't have a specific date on it but the plan is for later this year. Composer Austin Wintory, who also worked on Monaco, was hired to create the game's soundtrack. Sound design was done by PowerUp Audio, the team behind both Crypt of the Necrodancer and Darkest Dungeon. The game's characters speak a language based on Russian that was invented by PowerUp Audio's Kevin Regamey; Schatz told Louis Brierley of Heavy Mag the in-game language is translatable to English. In July 2017, Tooth and Tails official release date of September 12 was announced for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. Alongside this announcement was the game's trailer. Since release, the development team plans to continue updating the game with new content.  Reception  Pre- release Prior to Tooth and Tails release, the game received substantial media coverage because of the development process being made public and the release of alpha play tests. Many writers compared Tooth and Tail to the novels Animal Farm and Redwall. Reviewers including Adam Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer and Tom Marks of PC Gamer praised the game for redesigning the concept of the real-time strategy genre. In March 2017, Marks described the single player campaign as being similar to \\"a bite- sized StarCraft campaign.\\" The art style was also praised prior to release. Post-release Tooth and Tail was released to positive reviews from critics, garnering \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on both PC and PS4 according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Critics, such as Eric Van Allen of Kotaku, praised the game's ability to be inviting to newcomers to the real- time strategy genre while also appealing to veterans. Because of this, IGN listed it as a \\"game you might have missed\\" in September 2017. Davide Pessach of Eurogamer Italy recommended the game to everyone because of its many hours of fun. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid listed Tooth and Tail on his personal Game of the Year (GOTY) list, saying he would recommend it to anyone, including those who dislike real-time strategy games. Polygon writer Charlie Hall compared the game to StarCraft and wrote \\"the initial learning curve right now is simply too steep for most players\\". Brendan Caldwell of Rock, Paper, Shotgun concurred, saying \\"a tough mission [can] come along and take a chunk out of your enjoyment\\". The gameplay mechanics of multiplayer matches, such as the length and controls, received mostly positive reception. Hall wrote that while the game's single-player mode may be poorly balanced, the multiplayer mode is where the game excels. In Hancock's GOTY list, he noted the game would have appeared on it had it been a single-player game with the multiplayer mode as \\"a cherry on top\\". Hall said that because matches last around ten minutes, he found himself saying \\"just one more [match]\\". He said while the controls were good for newcomers, they have the potential to dissuade strategy veterans because of the inability to directly control certain units. Tooth and Tails art style, soundtrack, and audio received positive reactions from critics. Chloi Rad at IGN wrote that because of the combination of these elements, it was an \\"arcade-like strategy game experience like no other this year\\". Kotakus Alex Walker praised Pocketwatch Games for their ability to create \\"truly, truly beautiful\\" artwork without spending \\"millions of dollars teams of artists\\". AusGamerss Kosta Andreadis considered the art, while not the most impressive of 2017, subtle and pleasing in its presentation. He praised the ability of the animation to change intensities depending on the setting. Andreadis also commented on the audio, believing it added to the experience. Hancock commented on the similarities between the soundtracks of Monacos and Tooth and Tail; both of which were composed by Austin Wintory. The main similarities he noted were the fast-paced tracks during battle sequences and the use of slower tracks during less intense moments to imply a \\"revolutionary feel\\".

Most of his designs were in the then-modern Baroque style. Biography Sundahl's exact date of birth is uncertain. His father was Olaf Erikson Sundahl (1627-1697), a ship's captain. He had two brothers, Mons Erikson and Olaf. In 1689 - at the age of 11 - he matriculated at Uppsala University. In 1693, his uncle, Brynolph Hesselgreen, called him to Pomerania. In 1698, he was appointed Landmesser (surveyor) in Halland and South Sweden. The then king of Sweden, Charles XII, was also Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken in Germany. In 1702, , Charles' governor in Zweibr√ºcken, asked for the services of an architect.It is uncertain whether Oxenstierna asked simply for an architect, or for Sundahl by name. Sundahl relocated to the Palatinate, where he stayed for the rest of his life. His earliest known work dates from that yearimprovements to the fortifications of Zweibr√ºcken. Oxenstierna died in 1707. Charles presumably appointed another governor in his place. Charles has a warlike reputation. In 1702, he invaded Poland. In 1704, he deposed its king, Augustus II, and installed Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski in his place as a client king. In 1709, Stanis≈Çaw was overthrown by Augustus, was expelled from Poland, and sought refuge in Sweden. In 1714, Stanis≈Çaw relocated to Zweibr√ºcken, where he remained until 1718. In 1715-1716, Sundahl designed and built a for Stanis≈Çaw at Zweibr√ºcken, called , overlooking the Schwarzbach.\\"Tschifflik\\" is a germanisation of the Turkish word \\"√ßiftlik\\", which means \\"farm\\".Lustschloss Tschifflik was a very early example in Germany of the \\"English garden\\" style. He redesigned and rebuilt buildings at , where Stanis≈Çaw's daughter Anna (died 1717) was buried. Charles died in 1718. His cousin Gustav (1670-1731) inherited the title of Duke of Zweibr√ºcken. Stanis≈Çaw left Zweibr√ºcken. It seems that the existing accommodation at Zweibr√ºcken was not to Gustav's liking, because Sundahl spent 1720-1725 designing and building for him Schloss Zweibr√ºcken, perhaps his greatest achievement. From 1720-1725, Sundahl seems to have been chief architect () to the court of Zweibr√ºcken. From 1724 or 1725 to 1731 (sources differ for the beginning date), he was subordinated to Charles Fran√ßois Duchesnois.It is not impossible that Sundahl's architectural works between 1718 and 1724 or 1725, presumably authorised by Duke Gustav, were beginning to put a strain on the ducal finances. In 1731, he was reinstated to his earlier position.The facts that his employer Duke Gustav had died in 1731, and had been succeeded by Duke Christian that same year, may perhaps be relevant. He was thereafter again chief architect at Zweibr√ºcken, and was promoted to the rank of chamberlain (). In 1755, he resigned from his post (he was in his seventies), and was succeeded by his pupil and assistant (1726-1806). Personal life On 11 November 1705, Sundahl married Anna Dorothea von Bein (1680-1726), of a patrician family of Frankfurt am Main. They had 13 children, most of whom died young. Their third son, Johann Gottfried Christian, may have been a surveyor in Blieskastel and in the area around Kaiserslautern. On 26 July 1732, Sundahl married Katharina Sophia Heinztensberger, a widow. There were three children from that second marriage. Sundahl died on 5 June 1762, in Zweibr√ºcken. Works Sundahl has been said to have been influenced by the ideas of Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (1654-1728).

In 1687, he was elected assistant Alderman for the Second Ward and, thus, he began his long association with Albany's government. He was an assistant Alderman until 1698 when he was elected Alderman and served in that role until 1710. While on the city council, he focused on relations with the Native Americans and the ensuring real estate development continued in the city and beyond. In 1710, he was appointed Recorder (Deputy Mayor) of the Albany. In 1705, he was elected to represent Albany in the New York General Assembly.

Dr. Joe Church served primarily in Rwanda and Uganda. He left England in 1927 and served as a missionary for 44 years, alternating between medical and evangelistic missions. He is widely known for playing a key role in the East African Revival. Additionally he served as a doctor in Rwanda for over a decade and constructed hospitals and a church. He has been recognized for his work by governments in East Africa and Europe.  Early life  John Edward Church was born to Edward Joseph Church and Florence Edith Church in 1899. He grew up in a Cambridgeshire village named Burrough Green where his father served as a clergyman. He was the oldest of ten children and enjoyed a happy childhood in his small village where he often hunted and played cricket.  Education  At age 11, John Edward Church began attending the junior school at St Lawrence College, Ramsgate and later moved on to its senior school. He was able to attend this school at no cost because he was the son of a clergy. He did well academically and was well known for his shooting and hockey skills. In his senior year, he was enrolled into the officer cadet training camp of the Tank Corp as a result of World War I. At 19 years old, he was ranked as Second Lieutenant and served with the Twentieth Battalion at Bovington in Dorset. The war ended soon after this and through the British Army, he obtained a grant to attend Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge to study medicine. At Emmanuel College, John Edwards was heavily involved with Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (CICCU) where he began a Bible class and was the club‚Äôs college representative. His interest in mission work stemmed from this club. Joe Church did his medical training at St Bartholomew‚Äôs Hospital in London. In preparation for practicing medicine abroad, Joe Church pursued further training as a house surgeon and casualty officer at Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital, Cambridge. He received his Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1926.  Personal life  John Church married Decima Tracey, who was also a trained doctor, on May 19, 1930 in Uganda. The couple had five children: John, David, Robin, Michael, and Janine, all birthed in Rwanda or Uganda. Dr. Decima Tracey Church was an important part of Dr. Joe‚Äôs mission work and she often assisted with his medical work.  Mission Work   Medical Missions  On October 28, 1927, Dr. Joe Church set sail for his mission in Rwanda. He first arrived in Kabale, Uganda where he received missions training from Church Mission Society (CMS) for five months. Once his training was completed, Dr Joe Church was sent to Gahini, Rwanda, a village in northeastern Rwanda. He immediately began planning to build a new hospital building since there was an overwhelming demand for medical care. Gahini, Rwanda was experiencing a famine when Dr. Joe first began his work so he dealt with many cases of skin sores and diarrhea. Dr. Joe Church wrote many appeals to the Belgian and British government for food supplies to Rwanda and Uganda, his pleas were heard and he was recognized by the local Gahini government for helping with the famine crisis. Once Gahini Hospital was built, Dr. Joe worked there for eight years. He established a dispensary and often did life-saving surgeries and amputations. Dr. Joe was later given permission by the Rwandan government to establish more hospitals and dispensaries which he did in alliance with CMS. After eight years, Dr. Joe felt called to full time ministerial missions in Rwanda and Uganda and his younger brother, Dr. Bill Church, took over for him at Gahini Hospital.  Evangelical Missions  Dr. Joe Church and his family moved to Kabale, Uganda where he would focus on his evangelical missions for eight years. In his first year of full time evangelical missions, Dr. Joe wrote a book of Bible studies titled Every Man a Bible Student with over 40 studies. Dr. Joe used this book as a tool to train young men interested in ministry around Uganda and Rwanda.

Mar√≠a Cristina was raised in Seville, and given her father's close relationship with the Spanish Royal Family, she and her siblings were awarded the title of Infante and Infanta of Spain. She died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis. Biography Mar√≠a Cristina was born in Seville, a city in which her parents were forced to live in order to stay away from any palace intrigue in the court of Isabel II of Spain, her mother's sister. She was the third daughter of the nine offspring of her parents, but of them only three would survive childhood, apart from Maria Cristina: Marie Isabelle, Maria Amalia, Maria de las Mercedes, and Antonio. She was baptized Maria Cristina Francisca de Paula Antonietta, after one of her godfathers, her uncle-grandfather Francisco de Paula, Duke of Cadiz, and maternal grandmother, Queen Maria Christina, whose name was imposed. In 1878, her sister Mercedes, who was eight years younger than Maria Cristina, contracted a marriage with her cousin, Alfonso XII of Spain. The union, celebrated for love and not for political reasons, would help seal the personal gap between Isabel II and her sister, the Duchess of Montpensier, Cristina's mother. The happiness of the couple, and of the whole family, was shattered a few months later when Queen Mercedes died of typhus. The death of the Queen plunged the Royal Family into deep sadness; Alfonso XII was especially heartbroken to have been widowed at only 20 years of age, but since he lacked an heir, the King was soon forced to look for a second wife. For a few months he courted Maria Cristina, who was willing to replace her late sister, but it soon became clear that she was suffering from tuberculosis. Maria Cristina died at the age of 26 on 28 April 1879 in her native Seville. She was buried in the Pantheon of the Infantes of the Monastery of San Lorenzo of El Escorial. Her cousin, Alfonso XII, married on November 28 of that same year with the Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, and would have with her three children, Mercedes, named after Mar√≠a Cristina's sister the late Queen, Maria Teresa, and Alfonso, the future King of Spain.

Biography Poet Brian D'Ambrosio sits outside of a colorful abandoned building in rural Texas. D'Ambrosio was born in New York and grew up in Yonkers. After finishing high school he went to work for a Lake Placid newspaper. He later completed a degree in public relations and journalism at SUNY Plattsburgh. In 2000, he moved to Missoula, Montana, where he worked for a local newspaper. In 2008, amidst the decline of newspapers, he moved to Wisconsin, where he struggled with journalism for several years before returning to Montana. D'Ambrosio spent two and a half years researching the late Charles Bronson for the biography Menacing Face Worth Millions: A Life of Charles Bronson. He scoured newspaper and cinema magazine archives, and interviewed Bronson's first wife, Harriet; other family members; former cast and crew members; and residents of Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania, Bronson's hometown. The book was published in 2012 by Jabberwocky Press, a small Western Pennsylvania publisher. His books published in 2013 include a free ebook detailing the innocence of the later exonerated Ryan W. Ferguson. According to KRCG Television in Columbia, Missouri, D'Ambrosio wrote the book about the Ferguson case with the help of Ryan's father Bill. Free Ryan Ferguson: 101 Reasons Why Ryan Should Be Released has interviews, maps and pictures he said supports Ferguson's innocence. D'Ambrosio interviewed some of the NHL's most noted fighters, 30 subjects total, in Warriors on the Ice: Hockey's Toughest Talk.

It's a group in which some fall into the stereotypical mold, others restore and repurpose old chandeliers and antiques, and still others now hold PhDs.\\" \\"I think I just wanted to connect with these guys and share some of their pride and dignity, and let people know the guys that did it and continue to do it may not be doing it for the reasons you expect\\", D'Ambrosio said. \\"I think a lot of people who don't follow hockey will find it interesting. And it's always fun getting into the psyche of who we are, what we do and why we do it.\\" His most recent books include Warrior in the Ring, The Life of World Champion Native Boxer Marvin Camel, which was a High Plains Award finalist. The book brings to life the story and struggle of forgotten boxer Marvin Camel, a half-black, half-Indian pinball mechanic who became the first cruiserweight titlist.

Camel held the title only until the next fight later that year. His second championship tenure came in 1983 under the auspices of the International Boxing Federation World Cruiserweight Title, winning against Canadian Rocky MacDonald in Nova Scotia.

He served as Alauddin's governor of Gujarat, and held considerable influence at the royal court of Delhi during the last years of Alauddin's life. He was executed on the charges of conspiring to kill Alauddin, possibly because of a conspiracy by Malik Kafur.  Early life  Alp Khan was originally named Junaid, and was later called Malik Sanjar. He appears to have come from a family of Khalji chiefs. According to Isami, Alauddin brought him up since his childhood. Upon becoming the Sultan of Delhi in 1296, Alauddin gave him the title Alp Khan (\\"Powerful Khan\\"). His sister (called Mahru according to the 16th-17th century chronicler Haji-ud-Dabir) married Alauddin: Khizr Khan was the issue of this marriage.  Career  Alauddin appointed Alp Khan as Amir-i-Majlis (chief of protocol), and granted him the iqta' of Multan. In c. 1310, Alauddin granted Alp Khan the iqta' of Gujarat. The Jain works praise Alp Khan for allowing reconstruction of the shrines destroyed by the Muslim conquerors. Kakka Suri's Nabhi-nandana- jinoddhara-prabandha records the Shatrunjaya temple renovation permitted by him. In 1308, Alauddin ordered Alp Khan to support Malik Kafur during the invasion of Devagiri. Alp Khan's forces invaded Baglana, where the Vaghela king Karna had been given a principality by the Devagiri ruler Ramachandra. Alp Khan's soldiers were unable to apprehend Karna, but managed to capture Karna's daughter Devaladevi. Alp Khan sent her to Delhi, where she was married to his nephew Khizr Khan.  Death  Alp Khan's daughters married Alauddin's sons Khizr Khan and Shadi Khan. As the maternal uncle and the father-in-law of the heir apparent Khizr Khan, Alp Khan held considerable influence at the Delhi court, especially during the last years of Alauddin. In 1315, when Alauddin suffered from a serious illness, he vied with Alauddin's slave- viceroy Malik Kafur for control of power. Kafur convinced Alauddin to sanction the murder of Alp Khan. It was alleged that Alp Khan, his sister and Khizr Khan had conspired to poison Alauddin in order to make Khizr Khan the new king. However, this might have been Kafur's propaganda.

Early life Orelia Key Bell was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 8, 1864, to Colonel Marcus Aurelius Bell (1828‚Äì1885) and Mary Jane Hulsey (1837‚Äì1901), in the Bell mansion, a stately Southern home in the heart of the city built in 1860. The house became historic soon after Bell's birth, as the headquarters of General William Tecumseh Sherman's engineering corps led by Captain Orlando M. Poe, and the room in which she was born and spent the first three months of her life was that used by General Sherman as a stable for his favorite colt. The house was made of \\"plaster-covered stone marbleized in shades of blue, yellow, and red\\" and thus nicknamed the \\"Calico House\\". The house was demolished in 1925. Career The Calico House Both sides of Bell's family were from the gentry, and she was very thoroughly educated. Even when her family lost their financial security she managed to support herself and reach the fame through her poetry. Her warmest recognition from the press came from Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Magazine, Page M. Baker of the New Orleans Times-Democrat, Charles Anderson Dana of the New York Sun, Miriam Leslie, Henry W. Grady, and Thaddeus E. Horton, and her own home paper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Her poem \\"Maid and Matron\\" was used by Hortense Rh√©a during her performances. Bell was friends with Sue Harper, wife of Livingston Mims; Harper was the leader of the Christian Science movement in the South and founder of the first Church of Christ (Scientist) in Georgia; to her Bell owed the inspiration of her most enduring work, the International Series of Christian Science Hymns. \\"Millennium Hymn\\", published in February 1893 in the Christian Science Journal, is one of them. In 1942 she collaborated with British poet Alfred Noyes to publish a \\"patriotic leaflet\\". Her poem, \\"The Tocsin Sounds\\" is \\"dedicated to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Commander in Chief\\". Later in life, she \\"developed the art of transcribing her poems in gold leaf in china plate\\". Several works are exhibited at the Atlanta Historical Society, among other venues. She was awarded a bronze medal at the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta. She was an early active member of Pasadena's Browning Society, a poetry appreciation group. Ida Ash Orelia Key Bell in 1893 book A Woman of the Century In 1895 Bell published Poems of Orelia Key Bell, and the volume is dedicated, among others, to \\"Ida Ash, whose affection and encouragement have been among the chief sources of my inspiration\\". One poem, \\"Ida Ash\\", is under the section \\"The Heavenly Muse\\", and Ash is also named in the poem \\"At Mount Enota's Laurel'd Base\\" under the section \\"Melodies in Minor Key\\": Ida Ash :HOW did she come to me ? -or was it I :Who came to her? -or did we come together :Of one accord? I know nor whence nor whither :We twain were journeying was it yesterday, :Or some dim preexistence? -Destiny, :With iron tread -or Chance, blown like a feather- :Or clash of wandering stars or freak of weather, :That brought our hands to clasp in sympathy, :Our eyes to meet in music, and our souls :To leap en rapport? -Nay! as well divine :Which of two intermelting dewdrops rolls :First into the other. Whyfore seek a sign? :I only know, 'twas night: a voice: a flash :Of nereid eyes -then day- and Ida Ash. At Mount Enota's Laurel'd Base :AT Mount Enota's laurel'd base, :Where Hiawassee's waters flash, :'Twas there I met a mountain grace, :Beautiful Ida Ash. :As o'er the rocks, nereidianly, :She moved, with lissom step and proud, :Her eyes gleam'd like the Gemini :Beneath a shifting summer cloud. :The east-wind left its mourning cave :To nestle, dove-like, in her locks; :Tamed by her step, each madcap wave :Caress'd the conscious rocks. :The skylarks left their aery thrones :Amidst the serenading stars, :To catch her accent's Orphean tones :And beat its elegiac bars. :Ah, I have sigh'd to rest me, sang :She from II Trovatore; and thro' :A poet's heart the echo rang, :Ah, I have sigh'd to rest me, too. :Sweet Ida Ash! life's hills are steep, :And Art a glad toil at its best; :Then rest thou in my heart, and I :Sweetly in thine will rest. :Teach me to sing as thou dost live, :A simple life of love and duty; :Then I at least to Art may give :One song of everlasting beauty. On October 12, 1895, at the closing session of the Professional Work of Women National Council's Work, a selection of poems by Bell were recited by Ash and by her pupils, Lucille Atkinson and Mamie Tolbert. A newspaper noted that Bell's \\"popularity in the literary world was evident from the representative number of literary people present who heard with deep appreciation the delicate expressions of her poetic mind\\". Personal life Orelia Key Bell never married and she lived with Ida Jane Ash (April 9, 1874 ‚Äì August 3, 1948). Orelia Key Bell and Ida Ash, by the newspapers tagged as lifelong friend and amanuensis, moved to Pasadena prior to World War I and later lived at 2533 Greenbriar Lane, Costa Mesa, California. Orelia Key Bell died on June 2, 1959, and is buried at Oakland Cemetery (Atlanta) in the Bell family plot alongside Ida Jane Ash.

The city lies on the old caravan road between Najd and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Although completely surrounded by the vast Nefud Desert, Jubbah is known for its abundant agriculture and plentiful water and has a population of 20,000. Jubbah lies on an ancient lake bed (paleolake) that measures at least 20 km by 4 km with its full extent concealed beneath wind-swept sand on its northern, southern and eastern boundaries. The exposed part of the paleolake lies downwind of the mountain of Jebel Umm Sanman to the west, which has diverted the westerly flow of sand around it, leaving a sand-free depression that filled with water during past humid periods. Several archaeological sites of human settlement from the Middle Paleolithic period were found around the margin of the paleolake. Stone artifacts found at these sites are pertinent to ongoing debates about the timing, nature and routes of Late Pleistocene human migrations. Jubbah is surrounded by large sandstone outcrops that are filled with ancient petroglyphs and inscriptions on the rock face. Especially at Jebel Umm Sanman, which is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with other locations of Rock Art in the Ha'il Region. Some of these rock carvings show men wearing headgear, birds, monkeys, gazelles, and two animals pulling a wheeled cart. Jubbah was visited by Finnish orientalist and explorer Georg August Wallin in 1845. Wallin described spacious mud houses, each house having an attached grove and a water well, where camels were used to pull the water. The town had 170 houses, all of them from Al Ramal clan of the Shammar tribe. They looked pale and skinny, and lived a similar life to Bedouins, although they were settled in permanent houses. The town was frequented by many bedouins especially during the date season (although Wallin thought their dates were not as good as those in Al Jawf and Tayma), but also for its fertile grazing lands.

Cass (born c. 1983) is an American public policy expert and political advisor, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney in 2008 and 2012, and who has been described as a \\"general policy impresario of the emerging conservative consensus on fighting poverty\\". , Cass was a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and the author of The Once and Future Worker: A Vision for the Renewal of Work in America. In 2020, Cass established American Compass, an organization focusing on \\"what the post- Trump right-of-center is going to be\\". Education and early career Cass received a B.A. in political economy from Williams College, and was then hired as an associate consultant at Bain & Company. After working at Bain for several years in the firm's offices in Boston and New Delhi, Cass \\"took a six- month leave to work on Mitt Romney's 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination\\". Cass then enrolled in Harvard Law School \\"to deepen his understanding of public policy\\", stating of the experience that \\"law school is a lot of fun if you‚Äôre not there to be a lawyer\\". Cass \\"caught the attention of Romney's staff while still in law school and was tapped as domestic policy adviser for the candidate's presidential campaign in 2011\\": Following the 2012 election, Cass returned to Bain, where he became a manager, but also \\"started writing on environmental and labor policy for National Review. Senator Marco Rubio credited Cass for the poverty-fighting plan Rubio released in 2014. From this work, he was brought on as a senior fellow of the Manhattan Institute in 2015. Also in 2015, Politico named Cass number 35 on its list of the top 50 \\"thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming American politics in 2015\\". The Once and Future Worker In 2018, Cass published The Once and Future Worker, a broad re-evaluation of American society, economics, and public policy that earned widespread coverage and praise across the political spectrum. The book introduces what Cass calls \\"the Working Hypothesis: that a labor market in which workers can support strong families and communities is the central determinant of long-term prosperity and should be the central focus of public policy\\". He argues that the obsessive focus of policymakers and economists on \\"consumer welfare\\" has been misguided because it is as workers and productive contributors that people flourish and build strong families and communities. This is asserted to lead to innovative proposals for reform across a wide range of policy areas. National Affairs editor Yuval Levin deemed it \\"the essential policy book for our time\\". National Review concluded that \\"[t]his book and its policy proposals mark Oren Cass as one of the nation's most original and forceful policy thinkers\\". Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, described it as \\"a thoughtful, provocative, carefully argued book that made me change my mind on some issues that I thought I'd thought about quite a lot\\". The book has also been featured in publications including The New Yorker, The Economist, and Foreign Affairs. Donald J. Boudreaux, for the American Institute for Economic Research, disputed some positions taken by Cass, asserting that Cass focuses too heavily on the importance of production over consumption, to the point of extolling measures such as tariffs that coerce society into purchasing goods that would not be the first choice of uncoerced consumers. Environmental policy With respect to environmental policy, Cass has argued for moderation in debates over climate change. He has sharply criticized both those on the political right who question the validity of climate science and those on the political left who assertedly misuse it to paint an unsupported picture of imminent catastrophe. In a landmark essay in Foreign Affairs, he wrote: References External links * An archive of writings by Cass is maintained at www.orencass.com *Oren Cass profile, from the American Legislative Exchange Council *Oren Cass profile from the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research *Oren Cass profile, from City Journal 1980s births American writers Harvard Law School alumni Living people Williams College alumni Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Oren Cass"},{"id":"55194532","title":"I Believe I'm Fine"},{"id":"55194536","text":"Lungowe v Vedanta Resources plc [2019] UKSC 20 is a UK company law and English tort law case, concerning business liability for human rights violations and environmental damage. Facts From Chingola in Zambia, 1,826 people claimed Vedanta Resources plc breached its duty of care to ensure that its Zambian subsidiary (Konkola Copper Mines Plc) would not harm the environment and local communities. They claimed compensation for personal injury, property damage, loss of income, amenity and enjoyment of land because of copper mine discharges. Vedanta plc argued the English court did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim and should stay proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds. It argued there was an abuse of EU law. Judgment High Court Coulson J granted jurisdiction over the claims: the case could not be fairly pursued in Zambia. Forum non conveniens, after the case of Owusu was irrelevant under the Brussels Regulation (EU) 1215/2012 article 4. He rejected the argument that there was an abuse of EU law. To show abuse, the sole object of litigation had to be to oust another court‚Äôs jurisdiction, or that the claim was fraudulent. There was legitimate concern that the parent was the architect of the environmental pollution, and that the Zambian company had no ability to pay. The claim had a real prospect of success in holding the parent owed a duty of care: by establishing foreseeability, proximity and reasonableness under the three-fold test for the duty of care laid down in Caparo plc v Dickman. A claim in negligence could arise from the subsidiary‚Äôs operations, according to Chandler v Cape plc. Former employees were more likely to succeed, but residents have an arguable case, both in English and Zambian law, considering Erste Group Bank AG (London) v JSC (VMZ Red October).[2015] EWCA Civ 379 Claims against both defendants (the parent and subsidiary company) were closely bound together. The Zambian company was a necessary and proper party to the claim against the parent company. England was an appropriate place to try the claims. Also, ‚Äòif these claimants pursued KCM in Zambia, they would not obtain justice‚Äô. If it had been necessary, the court would have exercised discretion to allow service out of the jurisdiction on the Zambian company. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that Vedanta could be sued in England, and that the claimants' case in tort had a reasonable prospect of success. Supreme Court The Supreme Court unanimously held that Vedanta Resources plc could be sued in England, applying Zambian law although this was agreed to share similar principles to English tort law. There was an arguable case that Vedanta Resources plc, as the parent company, had assumed responsibility or had a duty of care towards the claimants who were harmed by Vedanta's subsidiaries. Lord Briggs gave the following decision, concerning the duty of care.

Diplomatic visits Qatari deputy PM Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah meeting with Thai PM Abhisit Vejjajiva in 2009 Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani made his first visit to Thailand in April 1999. Economic relations Qatar and Thailand have close links in the energy and tourism industries. Among the GCC members, Qatar is Thailand's third most important trading partner, and its main supplier of LNG as of 2013, supplanting Yemen in that category. Thailand is the most visited health tourism destination for Qataris. Around 30,000 Qataris visited Thailand in 2014. Qatar's main exports are crude oil, LNG, petroleum-based products, plastics, chemical products, and fertilizers. Thailand primarily exports cars, machinery, jewelry, food items and air conditioners to Qatar. In 2009, the trade volume between Qatar and Thailand was valued at $3.17 billion. This number increased to $4.3 billion 2013. The first time Thailand received an LNG shipment from Qatar's main gas company, Qatargas, was in 2011. An agreement was signed between the two nations in 2012 for Qatar to supply Thailand with 2 million tonnes of LNG annually for 20 years starting in 2015. Qatargas opened a representative office in Bangkok as part of the deal. The first shipment of LNG supplied as per the deal arrived in Thailand in January 2015. Qatar's first LNG shipment to Thailand via Q-Max vessel, the largest LNG carrier in the world, came in August 2017.

During his childhood he lived in the working- class neighbourhood of La Guinardera in Santa Coloma de Gramanet, close to Barcelona. As a child he didn't want to be a police officer, he was more interested in animals and biology. In 1989 he was admitted in the School of Public Security of Catalonia (Institut de Seguretat P√∫blica de Catalunya) where he graduated the following year. In 2006 Trapero graduated in law from the Open University of Catalonia and later on obtained a postdegree in Direction and Management of Public Security. His fields of specialization are cybercrime, money laundering, and terrorism financing. In 2012 he travelled to an FBI academy in Quantico, United States, where he participated in the Latin American Law Enforcement Executive Development Seminar (LALEEDS). As a Mosso d'Esquadra, Trapero has worked in the Basic Police Area in Girona and also in the Office of Complaints of Vielha. He also was a corporal in the Quatre Camins Prison. Later on, he was deployed in the Investigation Group in Blanes and Figueres, and afterwards he applied what he learnt in different regions of Catalonia. In 2008 he was designated as a Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigation (Divisi√≥ d'Investigaci√≥ Criminal, CGIC). A year later he was promoted to Sub-Chief of the General Criminal Investigation Group (Comissaria General d'Investigaci√≥ Criminal), and in 2012 he would be promoted again to lead the whole group. Just one year later he would be designated Commissioner of the Mossos d'Esquadra and in 2017 he was given the opportunity to get the position of Chief of police, which he accepted. On 4 October 2017, after the Catalan independence referendum of 2017, Trapero was accused by Spanish prosecutors for alleged sedition. He allegedly refused to carry out judicial orders on 1 October 2017. In addition, he is accused of obstructing a police investigation on 20 September 2017. Sedition in Spain carries a maximum sentence for public officials of 15 years in prison. On 16 October 2017 a Spanish prosecutor asked for Josep Llu√≠s Trapero to be jailed. Later that day, a judge would allow Trapero to remain free but withdrew his passport and ordered him to appear in court every two weeks. The court said that this could change if Trapero disobeys the conditions. In April 2018 judge Carmen Lamela closed the instruction and ordered the prosecution of Trapero, Pere Soler and number two of Joaquim Forn, C√®sar Puig, as well as of the mayor Teresa Laplana, charged for sedition.

He served as Alauddin's wazir (prime minister) at one point, and played an important role in the Sultan's Devagiri (1296) and Gujarat (1299) campaigns. He was killed during the Siege of Ranthambore in 1301.  Early life  Nusrat Khan was also known as Malik Nusrat Jalesari; \\"Nusrat Khan\\" was a title given to him by Alauddin. He was an Indian Muslim and the nisba \\"Jalesari\\" suggests that he was possibly associated with Jalesar for a long time or hailed from that place.  Career   Devagiri raid  Nusrat Khan became a follower of Alauddin, even before the latter's ascension to the throne of Delhi. When Alauddin was a governor of Kara, Nusrat Khan accompanied him during his 1296 raid on Devagiri. Alauddin led an 8,000-strong cavalry, but spread a rumor that his army was only the vanguard of a bigger 20,000-strong cavalry that would reach Devagiri shortly after his arrival. Ramachandra, the king of Devagiri, agreed to negotiate a truce, as his army was away on an expedition under the crown prince Simhana. However, Simhana returned before the truce could be signed, and challenged Alauddin to a battle. Alauddin left a 1,000-strong cavalry under Nusrat Khan in the Devagiri city, and led the rest of his army against Simhana. Alauddin's men were outnumbered and suffered reverses in the battle. When Nusrat Khan heard about this, he left the city without waiting for Alauddin's order, and led his contingent to the battlefield. Simhana's army mistook Nusrat Khan's unit for the rumored 20,000-strong cavalry and fled from the battlefield in panic.  Role in Alauddin's rise to power  After Alauddin assassinated his predecessor Jalaluddin at Kara in 1296, Nusrat Khan commanded a section of his army during the march to Delhi. Shortly after his ascension in Delhi, Alauddin sent an army to conquer Multan, which was controlled by Jalaluddin's son Arkali. The army captured Multan, and imprisoned Arkali and other surviving members of Jalaluddin's family. Nusrat Khan met the contingent returning from Multan at Abohar, and meted out severe punishments to the captives in accordance with Alauddin's orders. He blinded Jalaluddin's sons Arkali Khan and Ruknuddin Ibrahim, and later imprisoned them at Hansi. He also blinded their loyal officers Ulghu (or Malik Alghu) and Malik Ahmad Chap, and executed the sons of Arkali Khan. He brought Jalaluddin's widow (the former Malka-i- Jahan) and other ladies of the harem to Delhi along with Ahmad Chap. These surviving prisoners were kept under surveillance at Nusrat Khan's house in Delhi.  As the wazir  Alauddin appointed Nusrat Khan as his wazir (prime minister) shortly after the conquest of Multan. Nusrat Khan implemented Alauddin's plan to consolidate power in Delhi by arresting, blinding or killing the aristocrats appointed by Jalaluddin and his predecessors. Nusrat Khan obtained a huge amount of cash for the royal treasury by confiscating their properties. As a result of these measures, Nusrat Khan became very unpopular in Delhi, and Alauddin sent him away by making him the governor of Kara.  Gujarat campaign  In 1299, Alauddin sent Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan to invade Gujarat. The Vaghela king Karna offered a weak resistance, and the two generals ransacked several towns. Nusrat Khan marched as far as the wealthy port city of Khambhat, where he obtained a great amount of wealth from the local merchants and other rich people. There, he also forcibly obtained the slave Malik Kafur, who later led Alauddin's campaigns in Deccan. According to the Jain writer Jinaprabha, Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan destroyed hundreds of towns, including Asavalli (near modern Ahmedabad), Vanmanthali and Surat. They also looted several monasteries, palaces and temples. While returning from Delhi, the generals ordered their soldiers to pay khums (one-fifth of the share of loot). Some of the soldiers tried to conceal the true amount of wealth looted by them, leading to disputes. The generals severely punished some of the soldiers, leading to a mutiny near Jalore, mainly by the Mongol (Mughal) soldiers who had recently converted to Islam. The rebels murdered Nusrat Khan's brother Malik A'izzudin, who was Ulugh Khan's secretary. Ulugh Khan escaped to Nusrat Khan's tent, where the loyal soldiers assembled and forced the rebels to retreat. After suppressing the mutiny, the two generals marched to Delhi. There, Nusrat Khan meted out brutal punishment to the wives and children of the individuals who had murdered his brother A'izzudin. The children were cut into pieces in front of their mothers, who were raped, humiliated and forced into prostitution. These brutal punishments shocked the near-contemporary chronicler Ziauddin Barani, who declared that no religion allowed such acts. According to him, the practice of punishing wives and children for the crimes of men started with this incident in Delhi.  Last days  At the Battle of Kili (1299) against the Mongols, Nusrat Khan commanded the left wing of Alauddin's army. In 1301, Alauddin ordered Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan to invade Ranthambore, which was ruled by the Chahamana king Hammiradeva. During the siege, Nusrat Khan was hit by a manjaniq stone, and died 2‚Äì3 days later. Nusrat Khan's nephew Malik Chajju also served Alauddin, and led the failed 1302-1303 Warangal campaign.

It was planned in 1836 and built in the 1850s. It began in Porter and was extended south through Dover, Seaford and finally reached Delmar on the border of Maryland in 1859. Although operated independently, in 1857 it was leased by and under the financial control of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad. In 1891, it was extended north approximately with the purchase of existing track to New Castle and Wilmington. With this additional track, the total length was . Origin The railroad was conceived in 1836 by John M. Clayton, a former United States senator who obtained a charter from the Delaware General Assembly to serve the Delmarva Peninsula. He was concerned that a proposal in Maryland to build a line along the western side of the peninsula would harm Delaware's economy. Delaware was highly motivated and exempted the railroad from taxation for fifty years and provided other incentives. Clayton, William D. Waples and Richard Mansfield were appointed as commissioners and a survey of the line was made. The Depression of 1837-1839 prevented investment in the railroad and the charter was forfeited. The charter was renewed in 1848 under the promotion of Samuel M. Harrington (Clayton at this time was serving as the United States Secretary of State). It called for a line from Dona Landing (just east of Dover) to Seaford that would be part of a Philadelphia to Norfolk route. Sufficient investment was secured by 1852 allowing commencement of the operation. In 1853, the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad guaranteed construction bonds, and the line was built from a junction with the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad in Porter to Dover in 1855 and on to Seaford in 1856. Moving the northern terminus from Dona Landing to Porter added approximately to the originally planned length. The first section was opened with an inaugural eight-car train north from Middletown on September 1, 1855 carrying the president of the railroad and that of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad, the chief engineer, and railroad contractors. History Prior to the railroad, steamship traffic from Philadelphia ran to Dona Landing, a Dona steamship line port on the Leipsic River just off Delaware Bay and approximately east of Dover. Passengers would then go by stagecoach to Dover and south to Seaford where they would then resume travel by ship south to Norfolk on the Nanticoke River. Both the stage and steamship lines were made obsolete by the railroad and hence abandoned. The railroad ran inland to avoid wetlands near the coast through areas that had been sparsely populated. Railroad access spurred the growth of farms in this part of the state as farmers had means to ship produce north to Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Land that had not been farmed was cleared as the new access to city markets increased agricultural output. The railroad assisted the Delaware peach industry, allowing faster peach transport to market than had been possible by steamship. It also allowed the introduction of peach orchards to areas without access to river shipping. The industry spread downstate from the Delaware City area where it originated as the railroad extended further south. By 1875, five million baskets (900,000 carloads) of peaches were shipped on the Delaware railroad. The railroad is credited with the peach becoming a \\"signature crop\\" in Delaware - the first state from which peaches were a commercial crop shipped long distances to market. In 1863, peach farmers sued the railroad after they grew a bumper crop but the railroad did not have enough freight cars to accommodate the entire crop, and as a result there was significant spoilage. The railroad felt the judgment was \\"exorbitant\\". New towns formed along the railroad including Bridgeville, Greenwood, Clayton (nearby Smyrna did not want the railroad competing with its shipping industry), Wyoming (nearby Camden refused to allow the railroad to be built through the town), Felton (named after David Felton, president of the railroad) and Harrington. In 1855, the railroad located its main office in Clayton. Civil War Prior to the Civil War, southern sympathizers utilized the railroad as a route south to join the Confederacy. In 1861, Charles du Pont Bird (a descendant of E.I. du Pont) advised General Robert E. Lee that the railroad should be destroyed to prevent its use by the Union Army to ship troops and supplies to Washington, DC. The railroad remained under Federal control throughout the war. The railroad was used to ship contraband south to the Confederacy as its geography placed it in a prime smuggling route. Later 19th century In the latter half of the 19th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad had acquired the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, and several east‚Äìwest branch lines of the Delaware Railroad serving locations throughout the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland. These included the Junction and Breakwater Railroad and the Queen Anne's Railroad (later the Maryland, Delaware and Virginia Railroad). Opening in 1884, the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad utilized the Delaware Railroad track, with an extension south through Maryland to Cape Charles, located close to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay on Virginia's Eastern Shore and then by rail ferry to Norfolk, Virginia. The New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad was conceived by William Lawrence Scott, an Erie, Pennsylvania investor and coal magnate, who wanted to build a shorter railroad route between the coal wharfs of Hampton Roads by utilizing a ferry line across the Chesapeake Bay and a railroad line up the Delmarva Peninsula to the industrial north. In 1891, the former New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad track from Porter to New Castle and the former New Castle and Wilmington Railroad track was added to the Delaware Railroad (both then owned by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore) extending its northern terminus to the Christiana River in Wilmington. In 1910, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore renewed its lease of the railroad for another 99 years. The lease included the: * mainline Shellpot Crossing to Delmar * branch (cutoff) New Castle to Wilmington * branch Centreville, Maryland to Townsend * branch Chestertown, Maryland to Massey, Maryland * branch Nicholson, Maryland to Wharton, Maryland * branch Clayton to Symrna * branch Clayton to Oxford, Maryland * branch Seaford to Cambridge, Maryland Legacy In 1881, the parent company, the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, itself came under the control of the Pennsylvania Railroad, a larger and dominant railroad of the Northeastern United States. Facing financial difficulties in the 1960s, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with its rival New York Central in 1968 forming the Penn Central which itself filed for what was, at that time, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in 1970. The mainline of the Delaware Railroad was eventually absorbed into Conrail, created by the Federal Government to operate the potentially profitable lines of multiple bankrupt carriers. Becoming profitable in the 1980s, most of Conrail was sold off to CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1998. Norfolk Southern then operated the Delaware Railroad mainline until it was spun off in October 2016 to the Delmarva Central Railroad, a short-line railroad that operates of track on the Delmarva Peninsula. The majority of the Delmarva Central Railroad is the track of the former Delaware Railroad. The railroad extends past the southern terminus of the Delaware Railroad at Delmar another into Maryland to Pocomoke City. The railroad's station in Felton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and was renovated for use as a museum. The station in Wyoming was listed in 1980.

He has done most of his investing in central Europe, working mostly through a holding company called Centralway, and subsequently through a family office called Saidler & Co.  Career  Martin Saidler was born in Vienna, Austria in 1967. His mother came from Slovakia and he grew up speaking Slovak at home. He attended the University of Vienna where he studied journalism and political science. He then moved to Berlin where in 1997 he founded the employment website Jobinteractive.com. In 1998, it became one of the major job portals in Germany. In 1999, Beisheim Holding Switzerland (BHS) acquired Jobinteractive.com. BHS combined it with other businesses in a company called Scout24. Saidler stayed with the company until around 2001, scouting opportunities for them in central Europe, and cashed out just before the dot-com bubble burst. Saidler used that money, along with money from a Luxembourg fund called Incubation Capital SARL, as capital for the investment company Centralway AG, based in Zug, Switzerland, and developed it into one of the largest Internet corporate groups in central Europe. Through 2010, his investment strategy was to invest mostly in central Europe, in companies controlled by their founders that were making money and leading in their field; he would help them grow for three to four years, then seek an exit. Many of these transactions were among private companies, so the sources of investment and the amounts of money spent and earned are not known.; republished on author's website, as By 2011 Saidler determined that the market for IT companies in central Europe had become overpriced, so Centralway sold off most of its investments, stopped making new investments there, and starting looking at investments inside Switzerland, at a time when there was a rising market of internet-based startups in Switzerland. Centralway entered the Swiss market by acquiring an internet agency called Netvision and making it a subsidiary of Centralway, initially called \\"Centralway Factory\\", intended to be a corporate accelerator. The company Centralway Numbrs was founded in the accelerator in 2012 to create an app for mobile banking; its founder was Julien Arnold. In 2013 Saidler set up a venture capital fund called Centralway Ventures based in Switzerland but operating in the UK; it made an investment in Buttercoin. As of January 2018 the fund was closed down. In 2013, Saidler founded Saidler & Co. as a family office that operated through three arms; Statmentt, which invested in fintech companies, an investment fund, and a real estate investment fund operating in Switzerland, Austria and Hungary. Saidler invested in Centralway's businesses through his family office. The Numbrs app, which aggregated a person's banking and credit card information in one app, was demonstrated at a fintech conference in 2013, then launched in Germany in 2014. Centralway began focusing on fintech. By January 2017 the company said that people had entered about 1.5 million accounts into the Numbrs app and the company had raised about $125 million, and the majority shareholder was Saidler's family office. In June 2017 the company cut about a third of its workforce. In 2015 Saidler started travelling to Israel, seeking investors and investment opportunities in the IT sector there, especially in fintech. Boaz Barak, whom he knew from the Swiss banking industry, retired to Israel and became Saidler's liaison there. From 2017, more and more problems with the projects became known. In 2020, such problems were disputes with former employees about unpaid wages, drastic staff cuts and the abolition of the office with the compulsion to work from home.

Early career After earning a bachelor's and master's degree in law from National Taiwan University, Lin worked as a lawyer and served as president of the China Times. Political career Lin was a member of the Legislative Yuan between 1987 and 1990. In 1999, he was appointed to the Control Yuan, stepping down in 2005. As a member of the Control Yuan, Lin was active in a task force called to investigate James Soong's finances shortly before the 2000 presidential election, in which Soong was a candidate. In August 2000, Lin help impeach education minister Ovid Tzeng, giving several public statements on the case, which found that Tzeng was a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States while working at public universities in Taiwan. During Lin's tenure on the Control Yuan, he began a long investigation into the 1992 purchase of Dassault Mirage 2000 jet fighters from France. In 2001, Lin probed the cancellation of the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant construction that had occurred the previous year. Other investigations into the environment and public safety have led to censure of the Environmental Protection Administration in 2001, and three other government agencies in 2002, for inadequate responses to drought conditions the island faced that year. In September, Lin, Lee Shen-yi, and Chao Ron-yaw censured the Executive Yuan, which was found to have sent 40 percent of Taiwan's total foreign investment to China, leading to economic recession and increasing unemployment. The next month, Lin found that miscommunication between the National Immigration Agency and the Ministry of National Defense made the defection of Republic of China Army Lieutenant Wang Yi-hung possible, and issued censures to both agencies. In 2003, Lin issued a decision on the Ministry of Finance's attempt to repossess government property that was being occupied illegally, censuring the ministry for following outdated regulations, which in turn caused the repossession process to be inefficient. Later that year, Lin initiated an investigation into Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou's relationship with Fubon Financial Holding Co. Lin brought Ma in for questioning again in 2004, this time over the use of public billboards in support of Taipei City Government spokesman Wu Yu-sheng's 2004 legislative bid.

Additional variables are provided by a wizard (good) and a dragon (bad), who randomly appear in different areas on each turn. Players can add more randomness to the game by choosing to draw from a deck of incident cards at the start of their turn. Most of the cards are beneficial, but some have a negative effect.

Education and early career Huang earned a bachelor's and master's degree in political science from National Chengchi University, and later obtained a doctoral degree in the subject from Northwestern University in the United States. Upon returning to Taiwan, Huang joined the faculty of NCCU. In 2000, Huang proposed that several party positions be directly elected. The implementation of Huang's reforms resulted in the first direct election for Kuomintang chairman held in March 2001. Political career Huang led the National Youth Commission from March 1997 to February 1998. In 2001, he was elected to the Legislative Yuan for the first time. During his first term as a legislator, Huang supported the passage of sunshine laws, and backed the renaming of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to Presidents' Memorial Hall. He was a strong proponet for the use of absentee ballots. By mid-2004, Huang was the deputy whip for the Kuomintang legislative caucus, and was promoted at the start of the legislative session that began in July. After the Central Election Commission announced that the 2004 general elections, were scheduled for 11 December, Huang led criticism of the CEC, stating that the commission's decision favored the Democratic Progressive Party because the chosen election date was near the 25th anniversary of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident. The Kuomintang announced that Huang ranked eighth on its party list in September 2004. Shortly after his reelection, Huang stepped down as caucus whip. Upon the conclusion of Huang's second term in the legislature, he was named executive director of the Foundation for Democracy, despite opposition from the leadership of the group, some of whom subsequently resigned from the organization.

Cerf (born ) is an American education administrator and attorney who previously served as the state-appointed Superintendent of the Newark Public Schools in New Jersey.  Early life  Cerf was born in Illinois but grew up in Washington, D.C. Around 1970, he and his family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, where he attended Commonwealth School. He earned his undergraduate degree in history from Amherst College in 1977. He later graduated from Columbia Law School where in his final year he served as Editor-in-Chief of the Columbia Law Review. While at Columbia, Cerf had also spent his first summer working at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and his second summer at a Wall Street law firm.  Career  For four years before law school, Cerf taught history at Cincinnati Country Day School, a private high school in Cincinnati, Ohio. After graduating from Columbia Law School, Cerf served as a clerk to J. Skelly Wright, a judge in Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In 1985, Cerf became a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. As a clerk, former Justice O'Connor later described Cerf as \\"a hard worker, a sensible worker, and he was just excellent. You can't find any fault with him.\\" He later served on the advisory board of iCivics, an education non-profit founded by O'Connor. After his clerkships, Cerf worked as a lawyer in two law firms in Washington, D.C., a period in which he returned to the Supreme Court to argue two cases, one of which he won. One of two Washington firms Cerf worked for was Onek, Klein & Farr. Many years later, Joel Klein, a partner at the firm, would appoint Cerf as his deputy in the New York City Department of Education. Cerf later joined Bill Clinton's first campaign for President of the United States. And after the campaign, from 1993 to 1996, Cerf was associate counsel to President Clinton. In that capacity, he worked on tobacco regulation and efforts to protect prisoner‚Äôs rights to petition for habeas corpus. After working at another Washington firm, Wiley Rein and Fielding, in 1997, he was hired as general counsel to Edison Schools Inc. (now known as EdisonLearning). In 2001, Cerf was appointed the president and chief operating officer of the company. As of at least 2006, during Cerf's tenure as president, Edison Schools was the largest for-profit contractor for public school administration in the world. While at Edison Schools, he was responsible for the handling of the backlash stemming from company's administration of public schools in Philadelphia and he also attended the Broad Superintendent Academy founded by Eli Broad. After leaving the company in 2005, Cerf joined the consulting firm Public‚ÄìPrivate Strategy Group.  New York City schools  In early 2006, Cerf began working as a consultant to the New York City Department of Education with a salary funded by private donations. On December 21, 2006, New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein announced that he was appointing Cerf, who had assumed the role of Chief Transformation Officer, as deputy chancellor. Cerf is a longtime friend of the chancellor as they both worked together at the White House and Klein's law firm Onek, Klein & Farr in Washington. According to The New York Times, the appointment was part of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's initiative to increase private-sector participation in New York City schools. When appointed deputy chancellor, Cerf had disclosed to city officials that he had retained stock options from his time at Edison Schools and therefore would recuse himself from any decisions involving the company. He later relinquished \\"all equity interest\\" but was questioned by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board for soliciting a charitable contribution from executives at Edison in an email at the same time he relinquished his financial interests in the company. After being questioned by the ethics board, Cerf rescinded his request. Edison Schools had planned to make a $60,000 donation to Darrow Foundation, a non-profit wilderness and canoeing youth program in Maine. The Conflicts of Interest Board took no disciplinary action. In September 2009, Cerf left his post as deputy chancellor to join Mayor Bloomberg's re-election campaign as an education policy adviser. Cerf has held high positions in government and has worked for several for-profit educational corporations Global Education Advisers, and Sangari Global.  New Jersey schools  He was appointed New Jersey State Commissioner of Education by Chris Christie in 2010. In February 2014, Cerf announced that he would be leaving his post as Commissioner of Education at the end of the month to become chief executive of Amplify Insight, a division of Amplify. In June 2015, Cerf stepped down from his executive post at Amplify in anticipation of his appointment to head the Newark City School District. The same month, he also resigned from his membership to the board of directors of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, a lobbying group supporting charter schools, which he had just joined in April 2015. On July 8, 2015, the New Jersey Board of Education, which at the time had direct control over the Newark schools, voted 6 to 4 to appoint Cerf as superintendent of the district school system, replacing Cami Anderson. According to a February 2018 editorial in The Star-Ledger, Cerf closed the worst schools, fired the worst principals, and used a new contract to pay the best teachers more. By the end of his tenure as superintendent, the graduation rate had risen to 77 percent, a 20 percent increase. He was able to improve students' results in state standardized tests and increase the graduation rate while maintaining a balanced budget. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Cerf were able to end the pugnacious relationship between the city's leaders and state's Department of Education. In December 2017, Cerf announced his resignation as superintendent effective on February 1, 2018, a few months ahead of the end of his contract and the same day as the state returned control of the city school district to local control. According to The New York Times, the move was intended to ease the transition to local control. Cerf was replaced by his deputy, Robert Gregory, who took over as interim superintendent while the now independent school district searched for a permanent replacement.  Personal life  Cerf resides in Montclair, New Jersey. From a young age, he has enjoyed wilderness canoeing, and has led multiple expeditions near Hudson Bay. He has three children.

Of the 5,000 participants, she was one of only 6 women. In 1984, she raced in the first triathlon held in Spain, in Guadalajara, and won.  Sports management  At the end of the eighties she was a member of the Spanish Triathlon Federation, where, from its inception - except for a brief absence between 1994 and 1997 - until 2008, she held the position of Secretary General. From 2002 to 2008, she presided over the European Triathlon Union. In 2008, she was elected President of the International Triathlon Union, which was founded in Avignon, France in 1989. The International Triathlon Union was one of the first international sport federations that promoted equality between men and women, with the same prize money, distances, and media recognition for both sexes. Casado was re-elected in 2012 at the XXV Congress in Auckland (New Zealand), in which she defeated the South Korean Kyung-Sun Yu, by 82 votes to 33. In 2016 was re-elected for a third term. Upon assuming the presidency of the ITU, she became the second Spanish woman ever to preside over an International Federation of an Olympic sport.

The International Triathlon Union has promoted gender equality, and governing body quotas (20% women minimum) since its inception under the guidance of Marisol Casado and previous ITU president, Les McDonald. Her main mandate of her four- year term was the inclusion of mixed triathlon relay (two women and two men) at the Tokyo 2020 Games, which has been achieved. She defends the quotas in the National Triathlon Federations, and has advocated for an increase to 30%. \\"Very large steps have been taken in the last two years. All the federation codes of governance are being reviewed and in the IOC Agenda 2020 there is a specific section dedicated to gender equality. Almost all federations [have] positions for women. At the moment, through quotas, that is the fastest way [to achieve this]. In the hope that when they reach 30% [quotas] will be eliminated. I have defended them for many years and now they give me the reason. [In truth, woman only make up about 10% of the governing body board of directors], we are [likely] around 10%. Many interpretations can be made. When the IOC says that there are 33% women in commissions, it must be taken into account that someone like me is in four.\\" - Marisol Casado, March 2016.

It originated in Colombia. In an Escuela Nueva school, students learn independently, at their own pace. Typically a half-dozen students work at a table facing one another, rather than all facing the teacher. Much of the learning takes place through discussions among students and through guided independent work, with students who have mastered a subject helping those who are still learning it. The teacher offers advice and guidance as needed.  History  Escuela Nueva was founded in the mid-1970s by Vicky Colbert, along with Beryl Levinger and Oscar Mogoll√≥n as co-founders. Colbert's family had a strong involvement in education. Her mother had set up teacher training colleges in Colombia and her grandfather had been Colombia's minister of education. Colbert spent 40 years spreading this education model. It is now used in about 20,000 rural schools in Colombia and 19 countries worldwide. The system was developed for rural Colombian schools because they face special circumstances. In small communities, a one-room school might have students at many grade levels. Students often drop out for weeks or months to help on the family farm and have difficulty catching up. Students take exams when they feel ready.  Elements  Students have guidebooks for subjects such as mathematics, language, science, and social science. These guides serve as textbooks; they also include activities that students can do in or out of school to supplement the book. For example, the learning guide might explain vaccines, then \\"instruct a child to go home and check that her baby sister has had all her shots, or go with her father to inspect the water cistern to see that it's covered to keep out insects.\\" Students actively participate in decisions about their education. David L. Kirp, the author of several books about education, reported that \\"the student council meticulously planned a day set aside to promote peace; operated a radio station; and turned an empty classroom into a quiet space for reading and recharging. I was there last Halloween, when students put on a costume contest for their pets.\\" Teacher training is a third critical element. Escuela Nueva teachers typically must operate in a way quite different from what they experienced as children, providing support for self-learners rather than being the source of all information. Teachers attend three week-long workshops each year and visit other Escuela Nuevo sites to see the system in action.  Recognition  As Kirp noted in his story, \\"Escuela Nueva is almost unknown in the United States,\\" where the focus is more often on introducing technology into schools. Internationally, however, it has received wide acclaim. A UNESCO report in the 1990s concluded that it was because of Escuela Nueva that Colombia was the only country in South America where poor rural schools were providing a better education than city schools. Colbert received numerous awards and citations, including the prestigious 2013 Wise Prize for Education, the first Clinton Global Citizenship Award, the Henry R. Kravis Prize in Leadership, and awards from the Skoll Foundation and Ashoka.

Oil and gas agreements and investment opportunities were discussed during the visit. In February 2015, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani made an official visit to Japan. The purpose of the trip was to discuss ways in which to further strengthen bilateral ties. Political cooperation Japan established the Japanese Parliamentary Association for Friendship with the State of Qatar in 2010 in an effort to improve bilateral relations. After ISIS militants in Syria kidnapped Japanese citizens Kenji Goto and Haruna Yakawa in Syria in 2014, Qatar attempted to negotiate their release, but ultimately failed. On 5 June 2017, a number of Arab states severed ties with Qatar over its alleged funding of terrorist groups and its purported ties with Iran. As a result of the diplomatic crisis, shipping costs have increased, which has affected the status of regional trade conducted by Japanese companies. Qatar, being the world's second-largest helium producer, provided Japan with roughly a quarter of its helium supply prior to the crisis. However, after the crisis erupted, sanctions imposed on Qatar by its neighbors prevented its helium shipments from arriving in Japan. Following an official visit to Doha in September 2017 by Japanese FM Tar≈ç K≈çno, Japan's foreign ministry stated its willingness to help solve the dispute, and affirmed its support for Kuwaiti and American attempts at mediation. Economic relations In 1996, Japan entered into an agreement with Qatar to import 6 million tonnes of LNG for the next 25 years. Qatar's first LNG shipment to Japan arrived at the beginning of 1997, marking the first LNG export in Qatar's history. Japan accounted for 50.6% of all of Qatar's crude oil exports in 2004. During the same period, Japan was also Qatar's largest customer for LNG exports. Overall, Japan was Qatar's most significant trading partner in 2005, and accounted for around 40% of the value for all of Qatar's exports. Furthermore, Japanese products accounted for 11.6% of the value for all of Qatar's imports, representing the highest value among all of Qatar's trade partners. In April 2006, an economic agreement was signed between Qatar and Japan. Also that year, the inaugural meeting of the Japan-Qatar Joint Economic Committee took place. The Qatar- Japan Business Forum was held in Qatar in August 2013, during the visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. There were an estimated 50 Japanese companies with offices in Qatar in 2015. In 2015, when Qatar finalized the purchase of 24 fighter jets from France, Japanese banks agreed to lend Qatar $6.8 billion for a down payment. Japan was the main destination for Qatari LNG in 2016, importing 12.1 million tonnes. This provided Japan with roughly one-fifth of its annual LNG requirement. When several Arab nations severed ties with Qatar in June 2017, Japanese LNG buyers tried negotiating cheaper deals, which provoked Qatar to issue a warning that it may look elsewhere for buyers. Disaster aid In the aftermath of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani pledged $100 million in aid to Japan. In 2012, Qatar created the Qatar Friendship Fund (QFF) with the aim of spending the $100 million to help victims in the T≈çhoku region. The economic impact of the fund could generate an estimated ¬•180 billion for the ten years following its creation. Cultural relations On Qatar and Japan's 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations, Qatar Museums, in collaboration with a number of Qatari ministries, launched the Qatar Japan 2012 Year of Culture. Events featuring Japanese traditional dance, music, theatre and anime were held in Qatar throughout the year. The Japanese Embassy in Doha is active in organizing cultural events in Qatar. In an attempt to showcase Japanese culture, the embassy launched Japan Week in November 2015. Migration There are roughly 981 Japanese citizens living in Qatar as of February 2015.
