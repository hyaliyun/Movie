The nature of the riot were clashes between Northerners who were opposed to Nigeria's Independence and Southerners made up of mainly the Yorubas and the Igbos who supported immediate independence for Nigeria. The riot that lasted for four days claimed many lives of the Southerners and Northerners and many others were wounded. Causes The remote cause of the riot was the strained relationship between the Northern and Southern political leaders over the issue of self-government in 1956. This strained relationship started with a 1953 motion for self-government for Nigeria in 1956 tabled in the House of Representatives by a member of the Action Group (AG), Chief Anthony Enahoro. The Northerners did not accept the motion. The leader of the Northern People's Congress (NPC) and the Sardauna of Sokoto, Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, in a counter- motion, replaced \\"in the year 1956\\" with the phrase \\"as soon as practicable\\". Another Northern member of the House moved a motion for adjournment, a motion which Southern members of AG and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) viewed as a delay tactics. All the AG and NCNC members in the house walked out as a result of the adjournment motion. When the Northern delegates left the House, they were confronted by hostile crowds in Lagos who insulted, jeered and called them all sorts of names. Members of the Northern delegation were embittered and in their \\"Eight Point Program\\" in the Northern Regional Legislative House, they sought for secession. The last straw that broke the camel's back was the tour by a delegation of the AG and NCNC led by Chief Samuel Akintola. That tour which was aimed at campaigning for self- government acted as the immediate cause of the Kano riot. It sparked off a chain of disorder that culminated in the riot. The riot took place at Sabon Gari an area predominantly occupied by southern Nigerians. Riot There was already growing tension in the North when the Action Group northern tour came to Kano during the weekend of May 15-17, the tension was a result of the hostility towards the Northern delegation in Lagos. An orderly demonstration by the Northern Peoples Congress supporters against a proposed Action Group meeting took place on May 15. This was followed by small skirmishes the following day. Disturbances that led to the riot started out at the Colonial Hotel, on May 16, 1953 which was supposed to be the venue of a meeting by the Action Group led by Akintola. Prior the meeting, the Kano Native Authority withdrew its permission to grant the meeting. A mob gathered outside of the hotel and started stoning people close to the hotel, during the fracas, two people believed to be southerners died, the mob later attempted to gain entry into Sabon Gari but were subdued by the Native Authority police. The situation became more serious and became an inter-ethnic crisis on May 17 when mobs of hooligans from Northern section of Kano, in particular Fagge attempted to break into the Southern and Igbo dominated Sabon Gari area with some success, though their original chants were against the Yorubas, the casualties in the Sabon Gari area were mostly Igbos. Shops in the Sabon Gari market were looted and violent attacks took place. But the Native Authority police and the Army were called upon and prevented further entry of hooligans into the Kano area. The skirmishes further spilled into the indigenous Kano areas such as Fagge where small unorganized groups of people of different ethnic groups clashed. Daily Times. (1953). \\"Zik and Akintola Abandon Northern Tour. Daily Times of Nigeria, May 18, 1953, P. 1 My father, Dennis William Lyndon, told us of his experience in command of some of the troops. His orders were strict regarding the limited objectives of protection of property and of not provoking any escalation. With their bayonets fixed he held his men steady even as women and children were brought before him, their arms lopped off with machetes and fuel thrown over them before they were set alight. This was one of the worst of his experiences as an officer of the British army. An exchange of prisoners took place to reduce the tension, Southerners who were arrested were released and Northerners also released; Northerners in the Sabon Gari area were asked to leave and Southerners in the Fagge area were asked to move to Sabon Gari for the meantime. About 46 Nigerians mostly Northerners and Igbos died during the clash and more than 200 people were treated for injuries. Though it was immediately called an inter-ethnic riot by the colonial government in Nigeria, the political leaders termed it a political riot between people who want self government in 1956 and those who want imperialism to continue. Political implications The riot left behind great effects which include: * The relationship between North and South deteriorated. * Action Group and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons went into temporary alliance against the Northern People's Congress thus bridging relationships. * Granting of greater regional autonomy to the three regions. * Removal of power of intervention by the centre in all residual matters * Sir Oliver Lyttelton, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, announced that it is impossible for the regions to work together, and therefore representatives from each region will be invited to discuss a new Nigerian constitution. * it led to the adoption of a federal system of government.

Harpviken is foremost known for his competence on Afghanistan, where he has travelled extensively and conducted multiple field works since he first engaged with the country in 1989. Education and work experience Harpviken has both practical and academic education. He is a trained horticulturalist and has worked as a farmer for several years. He has his cand.mag., 4 years undergraduate degree (1989) and cand.polit., 2 years post-graduate degree (1995) from University of Oslo, both in Sociology. He has been a guest researcher at the University of Chicago (1998) and Georgetown University (2008). His cand. polit. thesis (equivalent to an M. Phil.) was entitled Political Mobilization Among the Hazara of Afghanistan, 1978‚Äì1992. In 2006 he defended his doctoral dissertation in sociology, entitled Networks in Transition: Wartime Migration in Afghanistan. Besides the main concentration on sociology, he has studied business and development studies. Between studies, Harpviken has served as agricultural coordinator and director for the Norwegian Afghanistan Committee in Peshawar, Pakistan (1990‚Äì92). He also served 4 months conscientious objector duty for the same organization in 1989. Harpviken fulfilled 12 months compulsory military service in 1981, and trained as a conscript sergeant with specialization in mortars. Since 1993, Harpviken has been affiliated with PRIO, first as a student associate, from 1995 as researcher, then moving on to positions as senior researcher, deputy director, and now director. He has participated and led multiple long-term projects on anti-personnel landmines, internally displaced and refugees, peacebuilding, as well as regional security. In 2004‚Äì05 he was the programme leader of PRIO's research programme Conflict Resolution and Peacebuilding (CRPB). Additionally, he has provided consultancy services to several international NGOs and multilateral organizations. Research interests Harpviken's specialties and research interests include the dynamics of civil war (mobilization, conflict resolution, post-war reconstruction and peacebuilding), migration and transnational communities, and methodology in difficult contexts. Geographically, his research is primarily focused on Afghanistan and the region, but he also has fieldwork experience from Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, Mozambique, Pakistan; in large part related to the landmine situation and the landmine campaign. He has taught several courses on methodology in crisis situations both for practitioners and graduate university students. Dissemination and outreach Harpviken frequently comments in national media on the situation in Afghanistan, and he is also concerned with Norway's peace policy and other aspects of foreign policy. As director of PRIO, he speculated and commented each year on the Nobel Peace Prize in media outlets from all over the world. In 2009, he was awarded the Norwegian Sociological Association's (Eastern branch) Dissemination Award.

Housing In Singapore, access to public housing is the biggest benefit granted to married couples and is officially recognized as key pillar of support for relationships. Public housing is the most affordable type of housing for the middle and working class due to the high price of housing in Singapore.bloomberg.comxinhuanet.com Purchasing a Housing Development Board (HDB) flat is a major step towards married life for almost all couples intending to formalize their relationship and is entrenched in Singapore society. Upwards of 80% of Singaporean families live in public housing apartments sold by the government Housing Development Board (HDB). Same sex couples in Singapore, whether citizens or foreigners, cannot own their own homes through the public housing scheme, and many rent as they are unable to afford private housing. Same-sex partners - both must be above 35 and Singapore Citizens - can purchase a flat under the Joint Singles Scheme. Private housing, a type of property typically 1.5 to several times more expensive than public housing, but open to the public and foreigners, may be purchased by same-sex couples both Singaporean and foreign. Legal status Section 377A of the Singapore Penal Code criminalizes homosexual sex between men, even if consensual. However, the Government has announced several times that the section will not be enforced in the case of consensual homosexual sex in private. Sex between women has never been criminalized. Immigration rights Legal and immigration rights are not awarded to binational couples, where one partner is a Singaporean or Singaporean permanent resident. Dependent visas, which are usually issued for heterosexual spouses, are not available for same-sex couples. Tax rights, wills, and spousal insurance benefits do not include same-sex couples. There is no recognition of same-sex couples in most areas of concern such as hospital visitation and Central Provident Fund benefits. Public opinion According to 2013 polling, some 75% of Singaporeans opposed same-sex marriage. In 2019, a poll conducted by YouGov with 1,033 respondents showed that about one-third (34%) of Singaporeans backed same-sex partnerships, while 43% opposed their legalization, and the remaining 23% were uncertain. Support was more notable among younger respondents: 50% of people aged 18 to 34 supported civil partnerships and 20% were opposed. In contrast, only 22% of those aged 55 and over supported. 41% of university degree holders agreed with the legalisation of same-sex partnerships, whereas only 26% of respondents without a university degree were in favour. Of those who considered themselves \\"very much\\" religious, only 23% supported civil partnerships. 51% of people who considered themselves \\"not at all\\" religious expressed support. Apart from irreligious people, majority support for same-sex partnerships was also found in respondents who identified as LGBT (71% against 22%) and those who personally knew a person in a same-sex relationship (52% against 33%). A survey conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies between August 2018 and January 2019 revealed that Singaporean society was still largely conservative but becoming more liberal on LGBT rights. The survey showed that more than 20% of people said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, a rise of about 10% from 2013. Around 27% felt the same way about same-sex marriage (up from 15% in 2013) and 30% did so about same-sex couples adopting a child (up from 24% in 2013). A mid-2019 poll conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies found that opposition to same-sex marriage in Singapore had fallen to 60%, down from 74% in 2013. The poll also found that nearly six in ten Singaporeans aged between 18 and 25 believed same-sex marriage is not wrong. In June 2019, an online survey conducted by Blackbox Research revealed that 56% of Singaporeans are opposed to other countries following Taiwan‚Äôs example in legalising same-sex marriage, while 44% said ‚Äúyes‚Äù. When asked on how they feel that more than 300 same-sex couples were married in Taiwan the first week after the new law was passed. About 49% of those surveyed felt positive about the statement, with 14% feeling ‚Äústrongly positive‚Äù, while 35% feeling ‚Äúsomewhat positive‚Äù. Conversely, 51% responded negatively to that, 20% felt ‚Äústrongly negative‚Äù while 31% were ‚Äúsomewhat negative‚Äù.

Its purpose was to collect surface runoff for the operation of the Upper Harz mining industry from precipitation-heavy regions a long way away (particularly from the Bruchberg and parts of the Brocken massif). It was laid in 1732 and continually extended eastwards until 1827. Its original length was about 25 km; this was successively shortened by water tunnels between 1820 and 1861 to around 19 km. It is a central component of the Upper Harz Water Regale. Its takes its name from the Sperberhai Dyke which is, in fact, an embankment on top of which the Dyke Ditch runs in an aqueduct in order to cross a depression.  History  Ditch near Altenau The history of the Dyke Ditch was initially closely related to the history of the Sperberhai Dyke. Not until the completion of the dyke in 1734 could large watercourses east of Clausthal be tapped into: the streams of the Gro√üer and Kleiner Gerlachsbach. In the years that followed, the Dyke Ditch was continually extended eastwards. In 1736 it was extended as far as the Kleiner Oker. In 1742, a neighbouring ditch, the Morgenbrodtstal Ditch, was built to carry water from the Gro√üe and Kleine S√∂se rivers to the Dyke Ditch. In 1774, it was lengthened as far as the so-called Wiege (\\"scales\\") on the Dyke Ditch and in 1820, after the two Kellwasser tunnels had been driven and the Blochschleife Ditch laid, the Kellwasser and the Blochschleife were connected to the Dyke Ditch system. The last addition was made in 1827, when the Clausthal Flood Ditch, the Fl√∂richshai Ditch and Abbe Ditch enabled water from east of the Bruchberg and the western Brocken to be made available for the Upper Harz mines. Yet another extension would have been possible but was no longer discussed. Now, attempts were made to fundamentally solve the energy problem in the Upper Harz mines by building deeper drainage adits (such as the Ernst August Adit). In addition from the second half of the 19th century other forms of energy (steam engines) were brought into operation, initially alongside water power. In the middle of the 19th century work was carried out to optimise water flow in area of the 10 km long section between Sperberhai Dyke and Clausthal. By cutting tunnels, several ditch detours around mountains were able to be shortened considerably. In addition to clear advantages in the maintenance overhead and winter operations, the increase in incline (the same drop being covered in a shorter distance) played an important role in increasing the hydraulic capacity. The water tunnels, built around 1850, were the Rothenberg, Coventhai, Dietrichsberg and Bielenwiese Tunnels. During its middle years the Dyke Ditch could carry up to 13 million cubic metres of water per year over the Sperberhai Dyke to the Clausthal Plateau. That made it one of the most important lifelines in the Upper Harz mining region. Following the closure of the mines the Dyke Ditch supplied water up to about 1978 for the generation of electricity in Kaiser Wilhelm Shaft. Since 1978 the water of the Dyke Ditch has been led to the M√∂nch valley of the Oker Reservoir at the end of the Dyke Ditch, where it still drives turbines for the generation of electricity and is then made available for the drinking water supplies of the Harzwasserwerke. Until about 2000, the Dyke Ditch also provided drinking water to the mining town of Altenau. This has since been withdrawn because the natural water supply was very unreliable, especially in winter and the quality of the water could also change very quickly. The operator of the Dyke Ditch today is the Harzwasserwerke.  Catchment area  Outlet of the Gro√üer Gerlachbach into the Dyke Ditch between Altenau and the dam house The Dyke Ditch draws its water from the region of six Harz rivers: * S√∂se over the Morgenbrodstal Ditch (1715‚Äì1718; length 3,970 m) * Sieber over the Clausthal Flood Ditch (also called the Rotenbeeke Ditch) (1797; length 3,900 m) * Oder over the Clausthal Flood Ditch and the Fl√∂richshai Ditch (1826; length 1,050 m) * Ecker over the Abbe Ditch (1827; length 1,540 m) * Radau over the Abbe Ditch * Oker over the Dam Ditch (1725‚Äì1840; length 14,690 m) The Dyke Ditch system crosses several watersheds as a result.  Statistics  The Dyke Ditch today is 19 km long. 15.4 km of that are open ditches and 3.6 km are underground water tunnels. Depending on how they are counted, its associated ditch system has an overall length of 49 km. On most routes the water descends by around 60 m. Its flow rate reaches a maximum of about 1 m3/s.

Two of these British aircraft were built in the mid-1920s. Design and development The Parnall Possum was one of few large aircraft having its engine in its fuselage and the propellers on its wings. The concept arose immediately after World War I, when the British & Colonial Aeroplane Co. (later Bristol), began thinking about large transport aircraft powered by steam turbines mounted in an \\"engine room\\" in the fuselage and driving wing-mounted propellers. They intended to develop the idea using their large Bristol Braemar triplane bomber, initially modified to be powered by four 230 hp (172 kW) Siddeley Pumas and called, in anticipation of steam power the Tramp. They obtained Air Ministry support for this project, the Ministry appreciating the extra safety of an aircraft whose engines could be serviced in flight. The Ministry also issued specification 9/20 for a smaller aircraft of the same configuration and placed orders for two prototypes with Parnall, for the single-engined Possum and with Boulton & Paul for the twin-engined Bodmin. They were described as \\"Postal\\" aircraft but were clearly experimental bombers; all three types were built but only the Possum and the Bodmin flew. The Possum was a single-bay triplane, with equal span, parallel chord wings without sweep or stagger. The lowest wing joined the lower fuselage longerons and the middle wing the upper longerons, with the upper wing held well above the fuselage on cabane struts. There were ailerons on all wings. The propeller shafts were mounted in the middle wing within small fairings and placed as close to the fuselage as the two-bladed, 9 ft 6 in (2.90 m) propellers would permit. One advantage of the triplane layout was that each propeller shaft could be symmetrically braced with a pair of X-shaped struts to the upper and lower wings. One set of Xs joined the forward spars and the other the rear. The wing structure was fabric-covered wood. The fuselage was also wood; slab sided and plywood-covered, from the side the nose was rectangular but it was rounded in plan, rather like that of the Vickers Vimy. The front gunner 's position was slightly back from the nose, with the pilot's cockpit just behind it and well in front of the wings. A rear gunner's cockpit was placed at the trailing edge of the high set upper wing, the gunners' cockpits fitted with Scarff rings. The 450 hp Napier Lion engine, a water-cooled unit with 12 cylinders in W or broad arrow arrangement was placed at the centre of gravity inside the fuselage, though with its cylinder heads exposed. There was a radiator on each side of the fuselage near the trailing edge; unusually, these were hinged so that they could be adjusted in flight more or less directly into the slipstream as the pilot chose. The Lion was mounted in line with the fuselage, with its output close to the leading edge of the middle wing, where a bevel gear transmitted the power via drive shafts to gears behind the propellers. The propellers counter-rotated at low speeds. At the rear of the Possum the fabric-covered wooden empennage was conventional. The fin had a straight and vertical leading edge but a curved top that blended into a rounded rudder which extended downwards between separate elevators; the tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage. Underneath, unusually for the time, there was a tailwheel rather than a skid, which was steerable and fitted with an automatic brake which provided increasing resistance with increasing load, unless the pilot overrode it. The main undercarriage was less innovative, with a pair of wheels single axle- mounted on short oleo legs to the wings with rear bracing. Preliminary runs had resulted in an increase in rudder area before the Possum's maiden flight on 19 June 1923. It was piloted by Norman Macmillan, accompanied by the Possum's designer, Harold Bolas. On 15 April 1924 the Possum went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough and appeared at the RAF Hendon Air Pageant in June that year. After some delay a second Possum was built, flying in April 1925 and transferred to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at RAF Martlesham Heath in August 1925. They were both active at Martlesham some time thereafter.

November was the wettest month across the United Kingdom since records began in 1914 and had well above average temperatures. The worst affected area in Great Britain was the English county of Cumbria. The Irish counties of Clare, Cork, Galway and Westmeath were among the worst affected areas of Ireland. European windstorms bringing heavy rain and gale-force winds caused damage and flooding to the south of Great Britain on 13‚Äì14 November. Unsettled weather continued across the south and later to the north. On 19‚Äì20 November, many towns and villages in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway were affected. A number of bridges collapsed, one of which led to the death of a police officer, who was standing on the bridge when it collapsed. Another death occurred on 21 November as a canoeist was trapped against a tree near Poundsgate, on Dartmoor in Devon. In Powys, there were two deaths, at Newtown and Talybont-on-Usk. Among the many places severely flooded was the Republic of Ireland's second largest city, Cork. For more than ten days, 40 per cent of its population were without running water after a treatment plant was affected by several metres of flood water. University College Cork was damaged and at least a week of lectures was cancelled. Courts were also disrupted, with some eventually being moved to a hotel. At the time, Taoiseach Brian Cowen described the situation in Ireland as an \\"ongoing emergency\\" that was going to get worse. Event Before the severe gales affecting the United Kingdom on 13 November, unsettled weather had been affecting all of the United Kingdom since 12 November. Sea conditions observed on 14 November in Brighton, England On 13 November an area of low pressure developed to the south-west of Ireland. It moved north-eastwards across the Irish Sea and west Scotland on 14 November. Weather fronts bringing heavy rain swept across the west and south of the United Kingdom. of rainfall in three hours was recorded in some parts of Sussex and Hampshire. The wind, coming from the south, reached gale to severe gale strength on 13 November; gusting between and in some areas. On 14 November, strong winds and showers affected southern Great Britain, with winds gusting up to and on the coast. A tornado was reported to have occurred in the east of England on 14 November. Over the night of 19‚Äì20 November 2009, a forecast depression tracked northwest over Ireland, the Isle of Man, Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway. Rainfall in a 24-hour period was recorded at at Shap and at Keswick. At Seathwaite Farm, Borrowdale, rainfall was recorded at in a 24-hour period which the Met Office state is provisionally a UK record for any single location. At Penrith a multi-agency co-ordination centre was established. The floods were described as \\"the worst in 55 years\\". The Met Office reported that at Eskdalemuir, the amount of rainfall recorded in a 24-hour period exceeded the previous record set in 1931. Heavy rain across Devon on 21 November caused the River Dart on Dartmoor to swell. A group of canoeists on the river were treated for hypothermia and one of the members died after being trapped against a tree at Poundsgate. Damage 1‚Äì12 November The Met Office predicted that an area of low pressure would \\"explosively deepen close to the UK on Sunday 1 November,\\" which resulted in heavy rain across the country. Thirteen people were rescued from homes and vehicles in more than 100 flooding incidents across Wales.

Police warned that it could collapse too. The bridge was later condemned, leaving residents in Northside a journey to get into Workington. Calva bridge had been built in 1841 by Thomas Milton. It was designed by Thomas Nelson. The bridge is a Grade II listed building. Although badly damaged, it was decided that the bridge could be repaired, as work carried out in 2005 to waterproof the deck had strengthened the bridge too. The contract for the repair work was awarded jointly to Balfour Beatty and Mouchel. Engineers warned that there was a 50% chance that the bridge could collapse during repairs. Two-thirds of the central pier's foundations had been washed away during the flood.New Civil Engineer, 27 May 2010 p10 The Dock Bridge, which carries the railway line linking Workington Docks and the steelworks, was badly damaged. Photographs show that at least one of the concrete trestles has been washed away, dislodging the rails on the bridge.

Thousands of homes across the country were left with boiled-water notices, and over 40,000 homes were left without any water supply. In Cork City, over 18,000 homes on the city's north and inner south-sides were left without water for up to ten days. This was as a result of flood damage to the city's water treatment plant. The Irish Army was deployed to deal with rising floodwaters at Ennis, County Clare and Clonmel, County Tipperary. Electricity supplies were cut off in Bandon, Cork and east County Galway. The house of one old lady in Athlone was even reported to have been the victim of flooding. A lorry driver had to be lifted from his vehicle in County Roscommon after it became struck in water beneath a bridge.

In Northern Ireland, the low- lying areas around the River Bann in County Armagh as well as the Strabane, Ards, Cookstown, Lisburn and Magherafelt districts were affected by flooding. County Fermanagh sustained the worst levels of flooding, with water levels on Lough Erne at their highest since first being recorded in 1956, owing to 35 consecutive days of rain. The floods affected many areas close to the shore of the lough including Lisnaskea and the county town, Enniskillen. 25‚Äì29 November The plight of Athlone, County Westmeath came to light at this time when water levels at the town's lock reached around 50 centimetres above the previous record water level, six of these centimetres occurring during one night. Farms and housing estates were isolated, with the west side experiencing some of the worst flooding and a school being forced to close for several days.

Farmland between Ballina and Foxford in County Mayo was flooded. Waterways Ireland claimed on 25 November that the water level of the River Shannon (Ireland's largest river) had become \\"unmanageable\\", with 33 per cent of the usual annual rain dropping in November alone. The water level of Lough Derg had broken all previous records by 26 November. This caused the purposeful release of more water downstream which subsequently flooded these areas by around 10 more centimetres of water. Further evacuations took place in County Clare and the city of Limerick. The Irish Army continued to patrol Ennis. Waters continued to rise in County Galway as well at this time. On 28‚Äì29 November torrential downpours and heavy winds spread across Devon and Cornwall, causing flooding and damage. Four people were rescued by firefighters from cars across Devon. Street-water levels reached near Exeter and near Sparkwell. Properties were flooded across the City of Plymouth and Ivybridge. Winds brought down an electricity pole in Millbrook, Cornwall. Ireland's flooding shifted to the east of the country on 29 November. Dublin's River Liffey burst its banks on 29 November, flooding several areas. Towns in County Kildare which were near the Liffey, were damaged by floods, including Ballymore Eustace, Kilcullen, Newbridge, Clane, Celbridge, Naas and Leixlip. A Clane nursing home was evacuated. Courts scheduled for Cork and Skibbereen were adjourned for several days due to flooded courthouses. Circuit court cases scheduled for Cork were moved to a hotel and High Court cases were moved to Clonmel. 30 November ‚Äì 4 December On 30 November, firemen had to pump water from one estate in Sallins from which 104 families were subjected to an emergency evacuation. The River Liffey was still impassable at Strawberry Beds. On 1 December, there was more torrential rain in the west, with drinking water supplies to 6,000 buildings in Galway reported to have been contaminated by human faeces and water undrinkable in more than 500 homes in Clare and Limerick. On 2 December, thousands of acres of Irish farmland remained underwater, floodwaters were still rising in some Galway villages and roads in Clare and Galway were still impassable. Transport disruption 13‚Äì14 November The Gloucester to Newport Line through Wales and England was closed at Chepstow after heavy rain caused a rockslide on 13 November. Several roads across Cornwall were flooded under of water. The Tamar Bridge connecting Devon and Cornwall was closed to bicycles, motorbikes and high-sided vehicles. Ferries between England and France were cancelled during the storm and the Port of Dover was closed during part of 14 November. 18‚Äì23 November Services on the West Coast Main Line were temporarily suspended after a landslip between Carlisle and Penrith. Services resumed by midday on 20 November. Services between Glasgow and Dunblane were suspended. The West Coast Main Line was flooded between Carlisle and Carstairs and was closed as a result. Services were reduced between Edinburgh and Glasgow and also Edinburgh and Dunblane. The Cambrian Line was closed between Newtown, Powys and Machynlleth as a result of severe flooding on the River Dyfi. Replacement buses were provided by the service's operator, Arriva Trains Wales. In the Republic of Ireland, Iarnr√≥d √âireann rail services were suspended between Galway and Athlone; Limerick and Ennis; Carrick-on-Shannon and Longford; Dublin and Maynooth; and Wicklow and Gorey. On 18 November, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company cancelled the morning ferry service from Douglas to Heysham and consequently the return service was also cancelled. The first service from Heysham was cancelled on 19 November. Services resumed with the 08:45 sailing from Douglas to Heysham. In Kent, ferry services from Dover were affected by strong winds on 18 November. Services operated by LD Lines, Norfolkline, P&O; Ferries and Seafrance were subject to delay. Kent Police implemented phase one of Operation Stack, using the M20 to park lorries on until they could be accommodated on a ferry. On 21 November, Irish Ferries cancelled all sailings due to have been performed by HSC Jonathan Swift on the Dublin ‚Äì Holyhead route. Passengers were accommodated on . In Workington, the collapse of Northside Bridge carrying the A597 road and the condemnation of Calva Bridge carrying the A596 resulted in a journey from Northside to the town centre. Network Rail constructed a temporary railway station, Workington North, to help Northside residents get into and out of town. Planning Resource The Royal Engineers from 170 (Infrastructure Support) and 3 Armoured Engineer Squadron are to install a temporary footbridge upstream of Calva Bridge, scheduled to open on 5 December 2009. In County Fermanagh, high water levels on Lough Erne resulted in the closure of most bridges that link the east and west sides of the county. Diverted traffic was thus forced to pass through the county town of Enniskillen, itself sited on an island in the lough, causing major delays. Away from the lough, the town of Lisnaskea as well as the villages of Derrylin and Boho also saw severe flooding, resulting in several road closures. 24‚Äì29 November 25 November saw fierce winds rattle Dublin Airport leading to the diversion of ten Aer Lingus, Delta Air Lines, Etihad Airways and Ryanair aircraft‚Äîseven aircraft to Shannon Airport and three aircraft to Manchester Airport. Some of the affected aircraft were transatlantic flights from destinations such as Chicago and New York.  Sports disruption  All horse races scheduled for Naas racecourse on 25 November were cancelled because of waterlogging. A horse race scheduled for 28 November at Wexford was cancelled four days earlier as the course was waterlogged. The Naas and Wexford events were rescheduled for 3 and 7 December respectively. Reaction On 21 November, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Cumbria Police headquarters, near Penrith, to meet members of the emergency services before travelling to Cockermouth where he met people who had been evacuated from their homes. He pledged an additional ¬£1,000,000 would be made available in aid for the affected areas when it was noted that the damages could well run into ¬£50 million to ¬£100 million mark. During his visit, Gordon Brown ordered checks to be made on all 1,800 bridges in Cumbria. It was feared that Calva Bridge in Workington would also collapse. Bridge inspections will be carried out by the Highways Agency and the Department for Transport. Cockermouth MP Tony Cunningham said that the buildings in Cockermouth may be broken, but the people were not. Following the death of the police officer, Cumbria Constabulary stated that over 10,000 people had signed a tribute on its Facebook page. The Queen praised emergency workers for the support they had provided. The ABI stated that the cost of the floods in Cumbria and Scotland could exceed ¬£100,000,000. In Republic of Ireland, the Taoiseach Brian Cowen stated that the Government's priority was the provision of shelter and safe drinking water for those affected by the flooding. He chaired two sessions of the Emergency Response Co-Ordination Committee on the weekend following the outbreak of the floods. Brian Cowen embarked on the first of his visits to Ireland's flood-affected areas on 23 November when he visited Clonmel, Cork, Ennis and Ballinasloe. The Taoiseach, taking a further half-day trip around Galway, Offaly, Roscommon and Westmeath to inspect flood- affected regions on 26 November, was confronted by the angry residents of Athlone who said he was using their plight as a \\"publicity stunt\\". Cowen refused to visit some of the most badly flooded areas of Athlone despite being offered a pair of waders and even a rowing boat. On 27 November, The Prince of Wales visited the areas of Cumbria affected by the flooding, where he expressed \\"nothing but the greatest possible sympathy\\" for the victims of the flooding. On 21 December, President Mary McAleese embarked on a two-day visit of flooded areas, praising the \\"utterly selfless\\" acts of those who were assisting. Aftermath of UK floods  As a result of the loss of all road and footbridges in Workington, it was announced that a new temporary railway station, Workington North, would be built on waste land leased for two years from Allerdale Council. The station opened on 30 November with services provided by Northern Rail. and remained open for a year. Construction work began in late November on Barker Crossing, a temporary footbridge, constructed by the British Army's Corps of Royal Engineers involving over two hundred soldiers. The bridge was expected to take ten days to complete. It was constructed to provide a link across the River Derwent after the Northside Bridge collapsed and the Calva Bridge was condemned. The replacement bridge is long, and weighs about . It was prefabricated at Halton Camp, near Halton- with-Aughton and was erected on-site in early December. The bridge was opened to pedestrians on 7 December 2009. On 26 November, three vehicles were observed driving over the closed Calva Bridge, Workington. The bridge had been closed by the use of temporary barriers. As a result of the incident, more substantial barriers were installed to prevent vehicles accessing the bridge. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral of PC Bill Barker in Egremont on 27 November 2009. Barker died after the collapse of a bridge in Workington. In December 2009, Tesco built a new temporary store in north Workington. People living in that part of town were finding it difficult to access the main store, which lies south of the River Derwent. On 22 October 2012, Princess Anne opened the new permanent road bridge on the site of the original Northside Bridge almost three years after its collapse. There had been calls to name the new bridge after PC Bill Barker however after the Town Council ran a local poll it was discovered that the residents would rather have it reverted to the old bridge's name, Northside Bridge. The final decision was then taken to PC Barker's widow who let the people of Workington decide.  Relief effort in Ireland  An initial emergency relief fund of ‚Ç¨10 million plus an extra ‚Ç¨2 million especially for farmers was announced by the Irish government on the afternoon of 24 November. In Ireland's Budget 2010, delivered by Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan on 9 December 2009, a further minimum amount of at least ‚Ç¨70 million was put towards those affected by the floods and to the prevention of similar disasters in future. The Irish Red Cross stated that it expected to raise ‚Ç¨1 million for survivors of the flooding and that it was starting to take applications for assistance from them on 12 December 2009. The organisation announced it had reached this total on 10 January 2010. The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul had two warehouses in Galway to collect aid for survivors. The Cork Flood Appeal Benefit Night was one fund-raising event which was held on 15 December 2009. Home Athlone was another event held on 21 December 2009.

He is from the North-eastern Indian state of Manipur. He was awarded the Padma Shri by Government of India in 2013. Achievements Ngangom Dingko Singh, usually known as 'Dingko Singh' is an Indian Boxer and considered to be one of the most outstanding boxers India has ever produced. He won the King's cup in Bangkok in 1997 and won the Asian Games gold in the 1998 Bangkok Games. He is a service personnel of the Indian Navy. He is well known for having grabbed a Gold Medal in the boxing event at the Bangkok Asian Games in Thailand in 1998. Early life He was born on 1 January 1979 in a remote village called Sekta in the Imphal East District, Manipur to a very poor family. Dingko had to fight back adversities right since the beginning of his life, and was brought up in an orphanage. National Boxing The trainers at a Special Area Games Scheme initiated by the Sports Authority of India identified the hidden talents of Dingko, and he was trained under the expert supervision of Major O.P. Bhatia, who later on became the Executive Director of the Teams Wing in the Sports Authority of India. Dingko's talent, efforts and training began paying off when he won the Sub Junior National Boxing Championship in 1989 at Ambala at a young age of just 10 years. This achievement brought Dingko into the eyes of the selectors and coaches, who began to see him as a promising Boxing star of India. International Boxing He made his debut into the arena of International Boxing in 1997, and won the King's cup 1997 held at Bangkok, Thailand. Apart from winning the tournament, Dingko Singh was also declared the best boxer of the meet. The Golden Opportunity He was selected for the Indian Boxing squad participating in the Bangkok Asian Games 1998. For unknown reasons he was dropped from the team at the last minutes and dejected Dingko went on a drinking spree, collapsing after a long session of drinks. Eventually he was selected and the event proved to be pinnacle of his career as he created history by winning the Gold Medal in the 54 kg Bantamweight category. The Journey to Gold In his journey to the Gold, Dingko had created a major upset by defeating Wong Prages Sontaya, an excellent Boxer from Thailand in the semifinal match.

Modern vehicle tracking systems commonly use GPS or GLONASS technology for locating the vehicle, but other types of automatic vehicle location technology can also be used. Vehicle information can be viewed on electronic maps via the Internet or specialized software. Urban public transit authorities are an increasingly common user of vehicle tracking systems, particularly in large cities. Active versus passive tracking Several types of vehicle tracking devices exist. Typically they are classified as \\"passive\\" and \\"active\\". \\"Passive\\" devices store GPS location, speed, heading and sometimes a trigger event such as key on/off, door open/closed. Once the vehicle returns to a predetermined point, the device is removed and the data downloaded to a computer for evaluation. Passive systems include auto download type that transfer data via wireless download. \\"Active\\" devices also collect the same information but usually transmit the data in near-real-time via cellular or satellite networks to a computer or data center for evaluation. Many modern vehicle tracking devices combine both active and passive tracking abilities: when a cellular network is available and a tracking device is connected it transmits data to a server; when a network is not available the device stores data in internal memory and will transmit stored data to the server later when the network becomes available again. Historically, vehicle tracking has been accomplished by installing a box into the vehicle, either self-powered with a battery or wired into the vehicle's power system. For detailed vehicle locating and tracking this is still the predominant method; however, many companies are increasingly interested in the emerging cell phone technologies that provide tracking of multiple entities, such as both a salesperson and their vehicle. These systems also offer tracking of calls, texts, web use and generally provide a wider range of options. Typical architecture Major constituents of the GPS-based tracking are: # GPS tracking unit: The device fits into the vehicle and captures the GPS location information apart from other vehicle information at regular intervals to a central server. Other vehicle information can include fuel amount, engine temperature, altitude, reverse geocoding, door open/close, tire pressure, cut off fuel, turn off ignition, turn on headlight, turn on taillight, battery status, GSM area code/cell code decoded, number of GPS satellites in view, glass open/close, fuel amount, emergency button status, cumulative idling, computed odometer, engine RPM, throttle position, GPRS status and a lot more. Capability of these devices actually decide the final capability of the whole tracking system; most vehicle tracking systems, in addition to providing the vehicle's location data, feature a wide range of communication ports that can be used to integrate other onboard systems, allowing to check their status and control or automate their operation. # GPS tracking server: The tracking server has three responsibilities: receiving data from the GPS tracking unit, securely storing it, and serving this information on demand to the user. # User interface: The UI determines how one will be able to access information, view vehicle data, and elicit important details from it. Common uses Vehicle tracking systems are commonly used by fleet operators for fleet management functions such as fleet tracking, routing, dispatching, on-board information and security. Some vehicle tracking systems are bundled with or interface with fleet management software. Along with commercial fleet operators, urban transit agencies use the technology for a number of purposes, including monitoring schedule adherence of buses in service, triggering automatic changes of buses' destination sign displays once the vehicle approaches the bus terminus (or other set location along a bus route such as a particular bus stop along the route), and triggering pre-recorded (or even synthetic speech) bus stop, route (and its destination) or service announcements for passengers. The American Public Transportation Association estimated that, at the beginning of 2009, around half of all transit buses in the United States were already using a GPS-based vehicle tracking system to trigger automated stop announcements. This can refer to external announcements (triggered by the opening of the bus's door) at a bus stop, announcing the vehicle's route number and destination, primarily for the benefit of visually impaired customers, or to internal announcements (to passengers already on board) identifying the next stop, as the bus (or tram) approaches a stop, or both; the latter are often also displayed on an internal LED display or LCD monitor connected to the system while the loudspeakers play them. Data collected as a transit vehicle follows its route is often continuously fed into a computer program which compares the vehicle's actual location and time with its schedule, and in turn produces a frequently updating display for the driver, telling him/her how early or late he/she is at any given time, potentially making it easier to adhere more closely to the published schedule. Such programs are also used to provide customers with real-time information as to the waiting time until arrival of the next bus or tram/streetcar at a given stop, based on the nearest vehicles' actual progress at the time, rather than merely giving information as to the scheduled time of the next arrival. Transit systems providing this kind of information assign a unique number to each stop, and waiting passengers can obtain information by entering the stop number into an automated telephone system or an application on the transit system's website. Some transit agencies provide a virtual map on their website, with icons depicting the current locations of buses in service on each route, for customers' information, while others provide such information only to dispatchers or other employees. Other applications include monitoring driving behavior, such as an employer of an employee, or a parent with a teen driver. Vehicle tracking systems are also popular in consumer vehicles as a theft prevention, monitoring and retrieval device. Police can simply follow the signal emitted by the tracking system and locate the stolen vehicle. When used as a security system, a Vehicle Tracking System may serve as either an addition to or replacement for a traditional car alarm. Some vehicle tracking systems make it possible to control the vehicle remotely, including block doors or engine in case of emergency. The existence of vehicle tracking device then can be used to reduce the insurance cost, because the loss-risk of the vehicle drops significantly. Vehicle tracking systems are an integrated part of the \\"layered approach\\" to vehicle protection, recommended by the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) to prevent motor vehicle theft. This approach recommends four layers of security based on the risk factors pertaining to a specific vehicle. Vehicle Tracking Systems are one such layer and are described by the NICB as \\"very effective\\" in helping police recover stolen vehicles. Some vehicle tracking systems integrate several security systems, for example by sending an automatic alert to a phone or email if an alarm is triggered or the vehicle is moved without authorization, or when it leaves or enters a geofence. Other scenarios in which this technology is employed include: *Stolen vehicle recovery: Both consumer and commercial vehicles can be outfitted with RF or GPS units to allow police to do tracking and recovery. In the case of LoJack, the police can activate the tracking unit in the vehicle directly and follow tracking signals. *Asset tracking: Companies needing to track valuable assets for insurance or other monitoring purposes can now plot the real-time asset location on a map and closely monitor movement and operating status. *Field service management: Companies with a field service workforce for services such as repair or maintenance, must be able to plan field workers‚Äô time, schedule subsequent customer visits and be able to operate these departments efficiently. Vehicle tracking allows companies to quickly locate a field engineer and dispatch the closest one to meet a new customer request or provide site arrival information. *Field sales: Mobile sales professionals can access real-time locations. For example, in unfamiliar areas, they can locate themselves as well as customers and prospects, get driving directions and add nearby last-minute appointments to itineraries. Benefits include increased productivity, reduced driving time and increased time spent with customers and prospects. *Trailer tracking: Haulage and Logistics companies often operate lorries with detachable load carrying units. The part of the vehicle that drives the load is known as the cab and the load carrying unit is known as the trailer. There are different types of trailer used for different applications, e.g., flat bed, refrigerated, curtain sider, box container. *Surveillance: A tracker may be placed on a vehicle to follow the vehicle's movements. *Transit tracking: temporary tracking of assets or cargoes from one point to another. Users will ensure that the assets do not stop on route or do a U-Turn in order to ensure the security of the assets. *Fuel Monitoring: monitor the fuel through tracking device (with help of fuel sensor connected to the device). *Distance Calculation: calculate the distance travelled by the fleet. *OBD II ‚Äì Plug and play interface which provides most engine diagnostics information. Vehicle tracking systems are widely used worldwide. Components come in various shapes and forms but most use GPS technology and GSM services. Newer Vehicle tracking systems also use the latest NB-IoT technology that can provide low power consumption and optimized data transmission rates. Additionally, these systems may also feature short range data communication systems such as WiFi. While most will offer real-time tracking, others record real time data and store it to be read, in a fashion similar to data loggers. Systems like these track and record and allow reports after certain points have been solved  Vehicle OBD tracking systems  Vehicle OBD tracking systems make use of OBD GPS trackers that plug into the onboard diagnostic (OBD) port of a light, medium or heavy duty vehicle. A cellular OBD GPS tracker directly communicates with the cell tower for sending the location and other vehicle performance data to the server over cellular wireless network. Usually, the tracker device draws power from the OBD port itself and contains a built-in antenna along with a GPS module for receiving the GPS signal. In addition, OBD trackers communicate with the different vehicle subsystems for receiving vehicle diagnostic and fuel consumption related data. Users can view the information using standalone software or web browser from a desktop/laptop computer or using smartphone apps.  Fleet management tracking  Aside from theft-prevention, the most common use of vehicle tracking is in logistics and transport. These systems make use of GPS and GSM technology to provide precise and constant location telematics to an individual fleet manager. These systems are typically equipped with features to monitor statistics such as; fuel consumption, average speed, current driver time and location. There has been a recent increase in demand for this technology as EU regulations place increased restrictions on the hours driver are allowed to work in a given day. It is currently limited to 9 hours per day. Companies are legally obligated to install a tachograph in any vehicle that is expected to carry goods. This obligation has led many to attempt to cauterize this potentially onerous obligation, instead turning it into a benefit. Fleet management systems use GPS & GSM technology. Much like other forms of trackers, although due to their nature they are equipped with more thorough diagnostic features. Other uses such as Trailer Tracking, Fuel Monitoring, Distance Calculation, Asset Tracking, and Field Sales can all be incorporated into a fleet management solution. Unconventional uses Industries not traditionally known to use vehicle tracking systems (logistics and transportation industries are the ones that have traditionally incorporated vehicle tracking system into their operations) have started to use it in creative ways to improve their processes or businesses. The hospitality industry has caught on to this technology to improve customer service. For example, a luxury hotel in Singapore has installed vehicle tracking systems in their limousines to ensure they can welcome their VIPs when they reach the hotel. Vehicle tracking systems used in food delivery vans may alert if the temperature of the refrigerated compartment moves outside of the range of safe food storage temperatures. Car rental companies are also using it to monitor their rental fleets.

History Statue of Tilka Majhi, Dumka, Jharkhand The year 1784 is considered as the first armed rebellion against the British and was the beginning of Paharia. It was due to great famine in 1770 and the consequences of Court of Directors orders influenced by William Pitt the Younger -- Court of Director issued ten year of the settlement of Zamindari and later in 1800 - this resulted in minimum chance to negotiate between local Zamdindars and Santhal villagers. Baba Tilka Majhi attacked Augustus Cleveland, British commissioner [lieutenant], and Rajmahal with a Gulel (a weapon similar to slingshot) who died later. The British surrounded the Tilapore forest from which he operated but he and his men held them at bay for several weeks. When he was finally caught in 1784, he was tied to the tail of a horse and dragged all the way to the collector's residence at Bhagalpur, Bihar, India.

Goblinshead. p.413 History and Structure Whittingehame Tower was built on lands belonging to the Cospatrick Earls of March. In the 14th century the lands were acquired by the Douglases. During the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots, they were held by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton. The property subsequently passed through the hands of the Setons, Hays and Balfours of Balbirnie, who occupy the castle still. Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905, belonged to this family. Whittinghame Tower in the 1920s Whittingehame Tower is an altered L-plan keep, comprising a rectangular main block and small stair-wing. It has a parapet which is corbelled out, with rounded corners. There is a cap-house, which was used as a dovecote in the 1930s. There is a vaulted basement. The hall, on the first floor, is panelled; its ceiling is finely plastered. The entrance is by the stair-wing. Some of the windows have been enlarged. The hall now houses a collection of documents and old prints. The tower is a category A listed building, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. Until the early 20th-century there was a raised terrace close to the tower reached by steps, overlooking the famous Whittinghame yew tree. This was probably a garden feature built by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton who is known to have constructed gardens at Aberdour Castle and Lochleven Castle or one of his successors.Marilyn Brown, Scotland's Lost Gardens (RCAHMS, Edinburgh, 2012), p. 121. The platform has sometimes been interpreted as a defensive feature for deploying artillery. Tradition It is said that in 1567 the Earl of Morton, the Earl of Bothwell ‚Äì the future husband of Mary, Queen of Scots ‚Äì and William Maitland of Lethington, the queen's secretary, were entertained here by the owner, Archibald Douglas. Maitland was the laird of Whittingehame's brother-in-law.Robert Pitcairn,Richard Bannatyne's Memorials of the Transactions in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1836), pp. 317-8. They conferred together in the shelter of a yew tree in the grounds to plot the murder of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, Queen Mary's unpopular and increasingly estranged husband. Morton, just returned from exile in England after the murder of David Rizzio, was unenthusiastic, and requested the queen's direct guidance. Despite the queen's reluctance to give the matter her sanction, the plot put together at Whittingehame was put into effect in due course. However, the hatching of this plot is more commonly thought to have taken place at Craigmillar Castle in late 1566.Fraser, Antonia (1970). Mary Queen of Scots. Panther. . pp.334‚Äì335 Mary's half-brother, the Earl of Moray, was received at Whittingehame by Morton and Lethington about 18 months later, and they concurred with his expression of horror at the murder of Darnley.

Her published literary work included 15 volumes, some of which were republished in England, and all of which found wide circles of readers. Her poetical productions were numerous. Over 100 of her poems were set to music, including her 1865 poem Lilly's Secret, which became the basis for the lyrics to the popular Christmas song Jolly Old Saint Nicholas. In her varied career, she was equally successful as writer, educator, temperance-worker, and journalist. Besides her literary work, Miller prepared and gave lectures on temperance, also on missionary and educational subjects. She was prominently connected with the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was a Trustee of Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois. Personal life In 1860, she married John E. Miller. Of their children, three sons survived, including George A. Miller; their only daughter died in infancy. She was a grandmother to Emily Huntington Miller Witherow, and great-grandmother to Robert Huntington Witherow. Lewis Miller (philanthropist) was a relation. Mr. and Mrs. Miller moved from Evanston, Illinois, to St. Paul, Minnesota, where the husband died in 1882.

Three cinemas occupied this site between 1925 and 1996, predecessors being Capitol Cinema (1925‚Äì1936) and Gaumont Haymarket (1937‚Äì1959). It became the Odeon Haymarket in 1962, before closing in 1996 and eventually reopening in 2017 as an \\"Odeon Luxe\\" cinema.  Capitol Cinema (1925-1936)  Built by Sir Walter Gibbons and opened in 1925, this was a large and ornate cinema in a Neo-Classical style, created as part of a development of an island site on this major London thoroughfare. Designed by Andrew Mather (architect of many later Odeon cinemas), the cinema used theatrical norms of stalls and circle seating, together with a number of boxes. An organ was installed and used during intermissions. Total seating was 1,700. In May 1928, Walter Gibbons company General Theatres Corporation was taken over by Gaumont British Theatres.Cinema Treaures: Gaumont Haymarket Linked 2013-12-06 The cinema is noted as the location of the first run of the first British 'talkie', Alfred Hitchcock's Blackmail in 1929. In its basement the Kit Kat Club was located, one of the most famous London nightclubs of the roaring 1920s (not to be mixed up with an older political club similarly named). In 1935, Gaumont decided to completely reconstruct the Capitol, by lowering the auditorium to take in the former basement premises of the Kit Kat Restaurant. The last film to play at the Capitol Cinema was Tom Walls in Foreign Affaires, on 18 January 1936.  Gaumont Haymarket (1937-1959)  The new cinema, known both as Gaumont Cinema and Gaumont Haymarket, was created by completely gutting the Capitol and turning the upper floors into offices. Seating was split between circle and stalls and totaled 1,328. A Compton organ was installed and the interior design was typical Art Deco. The entrance was moved from the north corner to the centre of the building, which had originally been the entrance to the Kit Kat Restaurant. The Gaumont opened on 4 February 1937 with a Royal premiere of The Great Barrier. In 1941 all assets of Gaumont British were acquired by the Rank Organisation.  Odeon Haymarket (1962-1996)  Following declining audience numbers, the Gaumont Haymarket was closed on 10 June 1959, with Robert Taylor in The Hangman being the last film. A second gutting then took place, creating a single-level, basement cinema with 600 seats and office space created above. Access to the cinema was from the southern corner of the building, leading to a small foyer and then stairs down to the screen. The cinema was spaciously raked and distinctively decorated in an alternating series of gold and tan wall stripped wall coverings and had a 'honeycomb' ceiling of circular holes. The new cinema, called Odeon Haymarket, opened in 1962. The Odeon Haymarket specialised in more up-market attractions, often for exclusive seasons. Films included Jacques Tati's Playtime, Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet with Mel Gibson, and Hugh Hudson's and David Puttnam's Chariots of Fire.  Closure  The cinema was closed in 1996 nominally for a refurbishment but later gutted to become a nightclub. Planning permission was granted on appeal on 27 April 2007 for a nightclub in the basement, but the landlords have struggled to let the space as it is restricted to D2 use but is too low for a modern cinema. On 12 August 2010 the permission was extended to 27 April 2012. Odeon Luxe (2017-) The cinema reopened in as the Odeon Luxe Haymarket in 2017, with reclining seats and retractable tray tables.

The Manifesto also contended powerfully against restrictive practices by trade unions and the collusion between the state and big business that negated the goal of a wide diffusion of wealth in a property-owning democracy. From the sixth form onwards, Abel was active in the Liberal Party, standing unsuccessfully in St Albans at the 1950 general election and Torquay in 1951.'The Times Guide to the House of Commons (1959), p.110 He shared the ambition of other activists like Lord Rea, Nancy Seear, Sir Andrew McFadyean and Leonard Behrens of reshaping and reviving the Liberal Party by leaving behind the internecine divisions of the inter-war period and making the case for a reconciliation of traditions of Gladstonian fiscal policy, individualism and the welfare state collectivism of Sir William Beveridge.Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party, 1914-1935 (London, 1966) In 1945 he resigned as Secretary and Editor of the Individualist Society to become Secretary of the Free Trade Union.

Among the characteristics of its writing system is an archaic, B-like glyph shape for the letter E (epsilon), a feature found regularly in early inscriptions from Megara and nearby Corinth.Jefferey, The local scripts of archaic Greece, p. 132f.Poinikastas, database of Greek inscriptions However, James L. O'Neil,O'Neil, James L., Doric elements in Macedonian inscriptions, Glotta 82 (2007): 192‚Äì210. p.198. following Hammond and Griffith,N. G. Hammond and G. T. Griffith, A history of Macedonia, Oxford: Clarendon 1979, Vol.2, p.96 conjectures that the inscription could also have been written locally in Macedonia. In this case, it would constitute the earliest known example of a local Greek dialect written in Macedonia, and would confirm the hypothesis ‚Äì derived from another archaeological find, the Pella curse tablet ‚Äì that Macedonian Greek was of Doric nature. O'Neil argues that there is evidence that a place in Macedonia was also called Megara, something that is also supported by Plutarch's records,Plutarch Pyrros 2,2 and that the inscription fails to display the specifically Megarian archaic shape of Epsilon. However, the notes by L. H. Jefferey for LSAG do show just this archaic Megarian form. Of the linguistic forms in the inscription, the word ·º∞Œ±œÅŒ¨ ('sacred') can be identified unambiguously as Doric. The archaic form of the name of the Goddess Athena, ·ºàŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ±ŒØŒ±(œÇ), is less distinctive and could occur in any dialect except Ionic, while the genitive article form œÑ·æ∂œÇ points to any dialect except Ionic and Attic. The form of the name Megara, with initial mh-, reflects its etymological origin *sm- and is found frequently in inscriptions from Megara but also elsewhere.

It has 175 inhabitants according to the 2001 ISTAT data, who are known as compignanesi. Though a more recent estimate puts the population closer to 177. It is a frazione of the comune of Marsciano, a larger town 12 km away, along strada statale 317 then provinciale 340 to Spina. Compignano is on top of a low (262m) hill, overlooking the valley of the river Nestore, which runs in a wide horseshoe-shaped curve at the foot of the hill.  History  Its name probably comes from Campo di Giano. The first appearance of the village in the historical record dates to 1240, where it is mentioned as the castle of the former podest√† of Florence Andrea did Giacomo, with Perugia as his and its overlord. The village was sacked by the troops of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor in 1312. In 1361 it tried to secede from the signoria of Perugia but in 1398 the castle was returned to Perugian control, passing to count Federico di Bernardino di Marsciano (also subject to Perugia) in 1440. In 1631 work began in the village on the construction of a palazzo for Benedetto Monaldi Baldeschi, bishop of Perugia, who visited the castle in 1637 and 1641 after his promotion to cardinal.  Economy  In the past it was known for its carpentry, construction of floats, blacksmiths, coopers, and hand-weaving. It has had several generations of furnaces, with a small museum dedicated to them in the village (Museo del Laterizio e delle Terrecotte) and a restored historical brick-furnace.  Monuments  * Castle - 13th century, with well-preserved circular walls and curtain walls. The entry gate, on Piazza della Vittoria, is surmounted by a stone tower (rebuilt in the first half of the 16th century), the only survivor of the original five towers. In 1925 the village's campanile was built on the remains of one of the other towers. * Palazzo Monaldi - Corneli (17th century); * Church of S. Cristoforo (13th century), in front of palazzo Monaldi. Around the end of the 18th century, it was almost wholly rebuilt, with a vaulted roof, five altars and paintings by Anton Maria Garbi. It was rebuilt again quite faithfully in 1905. Inside hangs a 17th-century painting of Saint Christopher. * Chiesa della Madonna del Crocifisso (late 16th century), a small church made of bricks. Inside are frescoes by the Perugian painter Gerardo Dottori, dating to 1921-22: a scene of the life of Jesus and two large angels CompignanoMarscianoSanCristoforo3.jpgChurch San Cristoforo CompignanoMarscianoSantissimoCrocifisso3.jpgChurch Santissimo Crocifisso (Madonna del Crocifisso) CompignanoMarscianoPorta1.jpgCity gate of Campignano CompignanoMarscianoCampanile1.jpgThe campanile of Campignano Sport A football field and shooting References  External links  All * Compignano * Frazioni del Comune di Marsciano * Furnaces of Compignano Frazioni of the Province of Perugia ","title":"Compignano"},{"id":"25144266","text":"To Ngoc Van is a pit-floored crater on Mercury, named after the Vietnamese artist T√¥ Ng·ªçc V√¢n.

Operational data analysis  In operational numerical weather prediction, forecast models are used to predict future states of the atmosphere, based on how the climate system evolves with time from an initial state. The initial state provided as input to the forecast must consist of data values for a range of \\"prognostic\\" meteorological fields - that is, those fields which determine the future evolution of the model. Spatially varying fields are required in the form used by the model, for example at each intersection point on a regular grid of longitude and latitude circles, and initial data must be valid at a single time that corresponds to the present or the recent past. By contrast, the available observational data usually do not include all of the model's prognostic fields, and may include other additional fields; these data also have different spatial distribution from the forecast model grid, are valid over a range of times rather than a single time, and are also subject to observational error. The technique of data assimilation is therefore used to produce an analysis of the initial state, which is a best fit of the numerical model to the available data, taking into account the errors in the model and the data.  Uses and examples  In addition to initializing operational forecasts, the analyses themselves are a valuable tool for subsequent meteorological and climatological studies. However, an operational analysis dataset, i.e. the analysis data which were used for the real-time forecasts, will typically suffer from inconsistency if it spans any extended period of time, because operational analysis systems are frequently being improved. A reanalysis project involves reprocessing observational data spanning an extended historical period using a consistent modern analysis system, to produce a dataset that can be used for meteorological and climatological studies.

Early life Robert B. Cullum was born in Dallas, Texas on May 10, 1912, son of Ashley Wilson and Eloise (Brooks) Cullum. He attended North Dallas High School (where he played on the football team), transferred to Kemper Military School, and then to Southern Methodist University; he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from SMU. He married Dorothy Dan Rogers. Business years Cullum, along with brother Charles, took over the family's business, which gained control of Toro Food Stores. They later renamed the chain of failing food stores Tom Thumb Food Stores. Cullum served on the board of directors of the State Fair of Texas, as president of the same from 1967 to 1969, served as president of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce from 1964 to 1965, and also served on the board of directors for Dallas Power and Light, the Dr Pepper Company, and the Republic National Bank of Dallas. Cullum was a trustee on the board of the Southwestern Medical Foundation (which evolved to form the UT Southwestern Medical Center) and of the Callier Center for Communication Disorders. He was also one of the three negotiators that formed the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport (now the DFW International Airport).

The houses were built in the early 19th century and are now Grade II listed buildings. The street is the northern projection of Belgravia and is often taken to fall into the category of London's garden squares. It is notable for its affluent and politically important list of residents, present and historic, and it today includes the High Commission of Singapore and equivalent Embassy of Luxembourg. Its closest public transit link is Hyde Park Corner tube station, beyond a cluster of affluent mews and St Paul's Knightsbridge (built in 1843). Overview Wilton Crescent was created by Thomas Cundy II, the Grosvenor family estate surveyor, and was drawn up with the original 1821 Wyatt plan for Belgravia.Opensquares.org It was named at the time of Thomas Egerton, 2nd Earl of Wilton, second son of Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster on whose estate the road was built in 1825 through Seth Smith (property developer) In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was home to many prominent British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900‚Äì1979) lived at 2 Wilton Crescent for many years, marked today by an attributive blue plaque. Akin to nearby developments, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on the southern part of the crescent. The Portland stone-clad, five-storey houses toward the north are high and were refaced between 1908 and 1912 via architects Balfour and Turner. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone-clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies. Wilton Crescent lies east of Lowndes Square and Lowndes Street, to the northwest of Belgrave Square. It is accessed via Wilton Place which connects it to the main road in Knightsbridge. Grosvenor Crescent is to the east, which contains the Indonesian Embassy. Further to the east is the back of Buckingham Palace and London Victoria station. In 2007, Wilton Garden in the middle of the crescent won a bronze medal from the London Gardens Society. There are two diplomatic buildings in Wilton Crescent: the High Commission of Singapore at No. 9, and the Embassy of Luxembourg at No. 27 (formerly home to the Luxembourgish government-in-exile). Layout and numbering The 50 buildings, some subdivided, forming the headline Wilton Crescent addresses are listed at Grade II. The crescent is split into three terraces of lengthy proportion buildings, plus 31 which forms a terrace with 1-15 Grosvenor Crescent, plus 32 and 33 which face the opposing side of a brief continuation of the eastern broad link into Belgrave Square which form a terrace with 1-11 Belgrave Square. The western broad link into Belgrave Square is however termed Wilton Terrace, split into 1-3 Wilton Terrace and is of identical date, style and proportions. References in the arts George Bernard Shaw's 1905 play Major Barbara is partly set at Lady Britomart's house in Wilton Crescent. Architectural details Of the main two quadrants and main facing return of the crescent, forming 47 of the 50 buildings, the first floor has stucco-applied doric order pilasters between the windows and a subsidiary cornice above.

The organization was founded in the United States in 1979 by equipment manufacturer Valley-Dynamo as the Valley 8-Ball League Association. It was later known as the Valley National 8-Ball Association, a name the league still uses sometimes Despite its name, it is no longer just national, having leagues in eleven countries, nor limited to the game of eight-ball, as nine-ball is also sponsored. The annual, week-long VNEA International Pool Championships are held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The organization is headquartered in Bay City, Michigan. the president of the VNEA is Marshall Kohtz. Business model Unlike most leagues, VNEA is tied to a specific brand of pool table, namely those of the Valley-Dynamo company of Richland Hills, Texas. As with most leagues, the league activity in any given geographic area (such as a city and its suburbs, a quadrant of a very large city, or an entire suburban county) is coordinated by an exclusive franchisee. In VNEA terms, these are \\"Charter Holders\\". All VNEA Charter Holders are authorized Valley-Dynamo distributors. All venues participating in the Charter Holder's area VNEA leagues must rent or lease their tables from the Charter Holder. As a consequence, VNEA leagues are mostly found in areas where bars and other establishments tend to rent tables from Valley distributors, whereas in other areas where the majority of venues own their pool tables outright other leagues are more common. The VNEA has active leagues in several countries other than the United States, all of which send teams and individual competitors to the annual International Championships. Format VNEA matches must be played on Valley- or Dynamo-brand \\"\\" coin-operated pool tables, considerably smaller than the regulation tables used by professionals and in some other amateur leagues. Regular VNEA league matches are, like those of the BCA Pool League, played in round-robin format between two teams of either five or (less commonly) three players each, with each player on the home team playing one () versus each player on the visiting team. VNEA playing rules were originally derived largely from informal American \\"\\", but have become increasingly consistent with the standard rules promulgated by the World Pool- Billiard Association, and used by some other major leagues, including the BCAPL and American Poolplayers Association. Local VNEA charter holders have a great deal of leeway in how games are handicapped, how players are sorted into skill-based divisions, and even in a few cases as to which rules apply. Charter holders often hold regular individual, non-team tournaments and other special events. Many tournaments have three skill divisions (Regular, Intermediate, and Masters), and provide for individual, mixed-gender , and team play. The Internationals provide for multiple levels of awards and trophies; a team might lose the main competition but may have a chance to win against other eliminated competitors in a \\"Hard Luck\\" division a few days later. The Internationals also provide a Classic division for seniors. Singles play is divided into open and women's subdivisions; women are not required to play in the women's division, but men are prohibited from it. VNEA International Pool Championships The organization's flagship event is held in Las Vegas annually and draws around 6,000 players each year. The week-long event uses upwards of 300-tables and also features numerous vendors and training sessions, as well as internal league training seminars for referees and instructors. The tournaments begin with singles eight-ball competition followed by doubles and finally the team championships. Singles and team competition are divided into divisions based on previous performance in prior years' championships, with most teams (including first-time participants) being placed in the Open division, with the Intermediate and Masters divisions being progressively exclusive. There is no other form of handicapping at the Internationals, a marked difference from the championships in many other leagues including BCAPL and APA. Men's and Women's singles are separate championships. Doubles must be one woman and one man from any team in any charter. Five-person teams may be mixed-gender, and must be composed of at least three players from the same charter. Teams eliminated from the competition early may be eligible to compete in secondary, tertiary and even quaternary competitions (the Sportsmen's, Hard Luck and Extreme Hard Luck divisions). There are other side events, such as 16-player mini-tournaments in eight-ball and nine-ball, trick shot challenges, instructional seminars, a grand opening party and a closing banquet. Special programs While they are not always held at the same times and venues as adult events, VNEA has a large and active series of youth tournaments. In some areas (especially the very VNEA-active Midwest) these are backed by youth training programs and even entire youth leagues. , there are around 5,000 youth players in 14 U.S. states and 3 other countries, forming around 100 leagues using a total of about 500 venues.

The band consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Sam (Shamsul Anuar), bass guitarist Youk (Farouk Jaafar), and lead guitarist Paan (Ahmad Farhan).The name Bunkface was suggested by Biak (former drummer) which was influenced from the Sum 41 song titled \\"Crazy Amanda Bunkface\\". Popular songs by Bunkface include Silly Lily, Situasi, Revolusi, Prom Queen, Through My Window, Ekstravaganza, Rentak Laguku, Malam Ini Kita Punya, Darah Muda and Masih Di Sini . Their fanbase are called \\"Bunkers\\". Biography  2007‚Äì2010: Lesson Of The Season and mainstream success  In December 2007, Bunkface released their first EP titled \\"Lesson Of The Season\\", featuring 6 English tracks, mixing a pop-punk/rock alternative sound. The hit song \\"Silly Lily\\" was number 1 on Hitz.fm's Malaysian Top Ten for 8 weeks and number 1 on Fly.fm's Campur Chart for 10 weeks. After the EP 's success, \\"Bunkface\\" then released their first Malay single titled \\"Situasi\\" in 2007. The song was originally intended to be recorded in English, but Youk suggested the band record it in Malay instead. A few months later, \\"Situasi\\" took the local Malay radio stations by storm and hit number No. 1 on Fly FM and steadily stayed at No. 3 on Era FM for 3 weeks. Bunkface won the Rockstar, Break Out as well as the Ultimate Shout! Award in the inaugural Shout! Awards which was organised by 8TV and held for the first time at the Stadium Bukit Jalil. Their achievements at the awards drew the interests of the organizers of the One Movement For Music Perth (OMFM), who subsequently invited them to perform at the festival, held on 16 to 18 October 2009. This marked their first time performing overseas in Australia. Bunkface performed at Jar Music Live's Showcase @ Monster in Kuala Lumpur and were picked by JMG's affiliate Asian A&R;'s to perform at the Maldives Breakout Festival. The band was on tour in 2010 as part of the Apex Tour, that included dates at the O2 Academy in early October 2010. During their tour in the UK, Bunkface were offered record deals by a few UK label groups. But the band declined as they felt they needed to strengthen their base in the ASEAN region first. Bunkface joined the Everyone Connects campaign by TMNet and sung the song \\"Through My Window\\", which was used in the campaign's television advertisement. The song was first heard over the airwaves when an anonymous CD arrived at radio stations in the country. This mystery generated an immediate buzz among the public, who wondered who the artists behind the song were. Bunkface's popularity soared when the reveal was made. Discussed widely throughout Facebook and Twitter, many commented on the viral and infectious nature of the song. Its fan base had numbered more than 17,000 and it has garnered more than 3.7 million online mentions and over 6,600 video and audio uploads on Facebook. The song even attracted a large crowd to a public sing-along at Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur which also became the largest sing-along event in Malaysia.  2010‚Äì2012: Phobia Phoney, side projects and tours  In March 2010, Bunkface released their debut full album, Phobia Phoney. Phobia Phoney was made up of 6 English songs and 4 Malay songs, including singles such as \\"Situasi\\", \\"Revolusi\\", \\"Ekstravaganza\\", \\"Prom Queen\\", \\"Soldier\\", \\"Escape Dance\\" and \\"Dunia\\". In mid-2010 Sam formed a side project called The Azenders along with his friends from other bands such as Izal (bass) from One Buck Short, Ajam (synth and strings) from Dichi Michi, and Kudut (Drummer) from Robot Asmara. The band released their first single on Facebook and their Myspace page called \\"Ladies & Gentlemen\\" which garnered frequent plays on local radio stations. They had also released two singles: one in Malay as \\"Peribadi\\", another in English called \\"Livin Rock and Roll\\". On 23 March 2011, the Hong Kong Asia Music Festival (HKAMF) was held at the Hong Kong Exhibition & Convention Center, Hong Kong. This festival was organised by the nation's IFPI and involved six countries from across Asia namely China, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia and the hosts themselves. Japan, initially an expected participant in the festival, was forced to resign their act, Ikumi Kumagai because of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. In the preliminary round, Bunkface performed 'Escape Dance'. Fierce competition narrowed the participants down to four acts ‚Äì China's Wu Qiong, Singapore's Kewei, South Korea's The Boss and Malaysia's Bunkface ‚Äì into the final stage. For this stage, all selected participants were tasked to play their own choice of any popular song from another artiste. Scoring criteria were strict. Bunkface's performance of \\"We Are the Champions\\", originally by Queen, earned them third place overall in both stage and vocal performances. Through this festival, the band successfully proved themselves on par with other popular Asian artistes. They also made a video clip for their single \\"Dunia\\" in the city of Hong Kong. 2011‚Äì2014: Panik and its airplay controversy, BF Rock Station and Bunk Not Dead Early 2011 was a quiet time for Bunkface as their previous single was released last year. However, in June bassist Youk announced that the band were working on new material for their upcoming album. \\"We will emerge with a new single and a second full album in the near future, with expected release in August,\\" he said. Before that, Bunkface had performed in Indonesia's Makassar Fest and received positive reviews. The Indonesian fanbase had created a Facebook page to support and promote Bunkface all around Indonesia. On 9 September 2011, Bunkface released their new single titled \\"Panik?\\" which written before the release of Phobia Phoney. It was recorded in Jakarta and was a big-budget production. Bunkface successfully performed in Jakarta's Urbanfest 1990 on 20 November 2011 and at Jakarta's Hard Rock Cafe on the next day. Offers came from 5 different recording labels which has representatives present at the showcase. Contract talks are still under negotiation and consideration. Bunkface received the special honour of being invited to appear on Indonesia's popular talk show Bukan Empat Mata, after Dato' Siti Nurhaliza and Amy Search, who were the previous Malaysian guests. They performed their biggest hit single \\"Situasi\\" on the show. At the end of 2011, the Malaysian government radio station Radio Televisyen Malaysia made the controversial decision banning airplay of the newly released single \\"Panik\\". It was initially reported that this was due to the word \\"reformasi\\" in the lyrics, allegedly a favourite among Opposition leaders during political campaigns, therefore making \\"Panik\\" an anti-government song. The denied airplay angered both Bunkface and their fanbase. \\"I do not understand the reason for the song to be banned. Is it wrong for us to use the word? There is no bad influence in the song. The \\"reformation\\" that was meant in \\"Panik\\" is not related at all to the \\"Reformation Movement\\" of the opposition parties,\\" was Sam's answer after being questioned by reporters about the issue on the night he had won The Best Young Composer from the MACP. Subsequently, RTM's Screening Director released a statement saying the problem was not with the word \\"reformasi\\", but the cuss word \\"celakamu\\" (Malay: \\"damn you\\"). She also stated that RTM did not ban airplay of \\"Panik\\", but merely discouraged it. Eventually, Bunkface released a clean version which was approved. On 16 January 2012, Bunkface launched their own jamming studio and merchandise store with the name \\"BF ROCKSTATION\\", located in Subang Jaya. It also doubled up as their office and caf√©. Sam had revealed in an interview that the name of their upcoming second album will be Bunk Not Dead. The album included 13 new songs, 9 in English (including unreleased songs like Bunk Not Dead and More) and 4 in Malay (including singles \\"Panik?\\", \\"Kita Perang Kita Menang\\" and \\"Jatuh\\"). According to the band, the album would have shown a more mature side where the songs are heavier and lyrically darker than their previous work. The album eventually launched on 17 July 2012 at Subang Jaya after two years of production. The first single \\"Panik?\\" was recorded and done completely in Jakarta, Indonesia, costing a total of RM 16,000. The remaining songs were recorded in Iseek Music Studio, located in Kota Damansara. Mixing was done by another Jakarta studio. \\"Bunk Not Dead\\" was distributed by Warner Music Malaysia. 2014‚Äîpresent:Malam Ini Kita Punya Malam Ini Kita Punya (Malay: Tonight's Ours) was released on 3 October 2014. The album contains seven Malay tracks including the eponymous song and \\"Darah Muda\\". All tracks were written and composed by Sam. It was their first album that is produced by Sony Music Entertainment Malaysia following their signing to the recording company earlier in the year. For the promotion of the album, Bunkface was chosen as DiGi x Deezer Spotlight Artiste of the Month and they were the first act to be featured in DiGi x Deezer Spotlight session from Malaysia. On 16 August 2015, Bunkface was invited to perform at the 2015 Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan. Musical style and influences Bunkface considers their music as Pop Punk, and they have cited Sum 41, Green Day, Blink 182, Fall Out Boy, The Offspring and Nofx as their main influences.

Retrieved on 27 May 2012. For his performances in 2012, he was named as captain of the Cricinfo IPL XI. Gambhir is the leading run-scorer of the Kolkata Knight Riders. During the same season, he scored 6 half-centuries out of a total of nine from his team and became only the second player to cross the 2000 runs mark in the history of the IPL and the second highest run scorer ever in the tournament. He led Kolkata Knight Riders to their second title in 2014 by beating Kings XI Punjab by 3 wickets. He led Kolkata Knight Riders to the playoffs in the 2016 and 2017 season and was also the highest run-scorer. For his performances in the 2017 IPL season, he was named in the Cricinfo and Cricbuzz IPL XI. On 27 January 2018, in the 2018 IPL Auction, he was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for ‚Çπ2.8 crore, and was appointed as the captain. Later Kolkata Knight Rider's CEO Venky Mysore revealed that Gambhir had asked the team not to retain him as he wanted to finish his IPL career where he started. On 25 April, Gambhir stepped down from captaincy citing poor performances of the team, and announced Shreyas Iyer as the new captain of the Delhi Daredevils. International career Early career Gambhir scored two successive double-hundreds in 2002 (one of them against the visiting Zimbabweans) made him a strong contender for India's opening slot in all three forms of the game. He made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in the TVS Cup in 2003. In his third match, he scored 71 and was named Man of the Match. His maiden century (103 off 97 balls) came against Sri Lanka in 2005. In 2004, he made his Test debut against Australia in the fourth and last Test match of the Border Gavaskar Trophy but did himself no favours by getting out for 3 and 1. He made amends in his second Test, however, scoring 96 against the South Africans. His maiden Test century came against Bangladesh in December 2004. Gambhir then made a number of starts in the home series against Pakistan in 2005 but was able to make only one half-century in six innings. He made 97 in Zimbabwe later that year, but failed to reach 30 against Sri Lanka at home, repeatedly struggling against Chaminda Vaas, and was subsequently dropped from the Test team. He was replaced in Tests by Wasim Jaffer, who made a double hundred and a hundred in seven Tests. While Gambhir was out of the Test team, he played a number of One Day Internationals for India between 2005 and 2007. However, he was not selected for the 2007 World Cup as the selectors opted for a top-order of Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, and Sachin Tendulkar. It affected him badly and Gambhir later said that \\"When I got dropped for the World Cup, there were times I didn't want to play anymore. I didn't want to practise. I couldn't motivate myself.\\" With no other career options, Gambhir stuck with cricket. After India's first-round exit from the tournament, Gambhir was selected for the One Day International on India's 2007 tour of Bangladesh. Believing the series could be his last chance, Gambhir scored his second century on that tour and was subsequently selected for the One Day International on India's tour to Ireland in 2007. He scored an unbeaten 80 against Ireland in the first game of that tour and was awarded the man of the match award for that effort. In the post-match interview, he indicated that performing more consistently was a top priority for his career as he had done so in the past. Gambhir was selected in India's squad for the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, which India went on to win in South Africa, beating Pakistan in the final. Gambhir performed well in the shortest form of the game, ending the tournament as India's top run scorer, with 227 at an average of 37.83, including three half-centuries which included a crucial 75 runs off 54 balls against Pakistan in the final. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup. For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World T20I XI by Cricinfo. Golden form Gambhir in 2008 In 2008, Gambhir was forced to miss the Test series in Australia due to a shoulder injury. In the 2007‚Äì08 CB Series, he scored an unbeaten 102 at the Gabba against Sri Lanka in a match washed out due to rain. Three weeks later at Sydney, he scored a career-best 113 off 119 balls against Australia, in a high scoring match which India lost by 18 runs. He finished the CB series as the leading run-scorer with 440 runs. In 2008 Gambhir finally solidified his place in the Indian Test team with a string of high scores. Opening the batting with Delhi teammate Virender Sehwag, he scored 858 runs at over 61 in seven matches as of December including a double century against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, in the same match, he was involved in controversy when he elbowed bowler Shane Watson while taking a run. Gambhir asserted it was accidental, but was banned for one Test. Gambhir scored 463 runs in the series, which despite missing the last match was more than any other player in the series. He was the leading run-scorer in the Test series against England in December 2008 and against New Zealand in early 2009, meaning that he had achieved this feat in three consecutive series. For his performances in 2008, he was named in the World Test XI and ODI XI by Cricinfo. Gambhir played his first major Test series outside the sub- continent, having toured New Zealand in 2009. In the second Test match, he scored a match-saving 137 in the second innings. He stood more than five sessions in the middle and faced over 430 balls. This innings led Virender Sehwag, Gambhir's opening partner, close friend, and captain for the match, to call him 'The Second Wall' in reference to Rahul Dravid. He then scored 167 in the second innings of the Third Test to give India an unassailable lead, but rain helped the New Zealand batsmen to hang on for a draw. Gambhir, with 445 runs in six innings at an average of 89, helped India win 1‚Äì0 to script a series win in that country after 41 years. Through ranks He was named as the ICC Test Player of the Year for 2009, and was briefly ranked the No. 1 batsman in the ICC rankings in July; at the time India were not playing Tests and his points rating did not change, but other batsmen who were ranked higher lost points before regaining them. He continued his run in the late-2009 Test series against Sri Lanka at home. He scored a century in the second innings of the First Test in Ahmedabad to force a draw after the visitors had taken a first innings lead of more than 300, and then combined in a double century opening partnership with Sehwag on the first day of the Second Test in Kanpur, scoring 167 himself and helping India to score more than 400 runs on the opening day. This set up their score of 642 and an innings victory. Following the match, Gambhir returned to the top of the ICC rankings. Gambhir withdrew from the Third and final Test against Sri Lanka at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai in order to attend his sister's wedding. In the First Test against Bangladesh in Chittagong in January 2009, Gambhir hit a rapid 116 from 129 balls. It was his fifth century in as many Tests and made him the fourth player to achieve this feat. Only Don Bradman has managed six centuries in as many matches. In the 29th Test match against Bangladesh at Dhaka, he rewrote the history of IVA Richards by scoring most fifties plus runs in 11 consecutive matches. In this match, he scored 66 runs. For his performances in 2009, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC. Brief captaincy In 2010, Gambhir was appointed captain of the national team in ODI series against New Zealand which was hosted by India. He scored an unbeaten 150 in the fourth match in Calcutta to help seal the series, guiding the hosts to victory in the run-chase. He eventually earned the Man-of-the-Series award for leading India to a 5‚Äì0 win. He then returned as captain of the side in India's match against the West Indies in December 2011.Team records  One-Day Internationals  Cricinfo Statsguru  ESPN Cricinfo. Stats.espncricinfo.com. Retrieved on 23 December 2013. Post-captaincy In the final of the Cricket World Cup 2011, Gambhir scored a solid knock of 97 from 122 balls. Coming in to bat in the first over after the dismissal of Virender Sehwag, he anchored the Indian inning despite the early dismissal of both the openers. He had a good partnership first with Kohli, and then a match-winning partnership of 109 runs with MS Dhoni. In 2011, India's batting line-up struggled in Tests, particularly away from home. Out of sixteen innings in away Tests, India passed 300 just twice and both the team's opening batsmen failed to score a century in the format in the whole of 2011. Between February 2010 and November 2011, Gambhir played in 14 Tests. From 25 innings he scored 704 runs at an average of 29.33. In the same period, only two opening batsmen who had played at least 15 innings had a worse average: Phillip Hughes of Australia and Imrul Kayes of Bangladesh. However, while he was struggling in Tests, Gambhir enjoyed a rich run of form in ODIs, averaging 56.90 from 23 matches. Gambhir opened the batting in all four of India's Test defeats against Australia in 2011‚Äì12. He scored 181 runs at an average of 22.62. For his performances in 2012, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC. On 12 February 2012, Gambhir scored 92 off 111 balls in an ODI match against Australia at the Adelaide Oval, to help India win their first match against the hosts at that venue. It was also India's highest successful run chase in Australia. For his effort, Gambhir won the Man of the Match award. On 14 February 2012, against Sri Lanka, Gambhir yet again missed out on an ODI hundred when he was dismissed run out for a fine 91 off 106 balls. This knock from Gambhir was instrumental in securing a thrilling tie in that match. In August 2012, the Indian selection committee handed him back vice-captaincy of the T20 squad for the World Cup. Comeback After a big absence from international cricket, on 8 October 2016, Gambhir was recalled for the Test-Match series against New Zealand, after showing good form in domestic cricket. Retirement Indian President Ram Nath Kovind presenting the Padma Shri Award to Gautam Gambhir on 16 March 2019 Gambhir announced his retirement from all forms of cricket on 3 December 2018, ahead of his final match for the Delhi cricket team against the Andhra cricket team in the Ranji Trophy on 6 December 2018. Gambhir went on to score 112 in his final innings, his 43rd century in first-class cricket. Gautam Gambhir began his new innings as a parliamentarian as he took oath as the Lok Sabha MP on 17 June 2019. Gautam Gambhir Foundation The Gautam Gambhir Foundation is the philanthropic initiative of Gautam Gambhir. It was started in 2014 and is based out of Delhi. He set up community kitchens in 2017 through the Foundation in Patel Nagar, Delhi, in a bid to make sure no one slept hungry in the city. The key project of the Foundation is to reach out to as many children of paramilitary martyrs as possible and empower them by supporting their entire educational needs.

This allowed them to forge metal, cook and illuminate their houses. As a result of this, the people united and became a nation.Lecha Ilyasov. The Diversity of the Chechen Culture: From Historical Roots to the Present. Pkharmat is the Vainakh equivalent of the Greek hero Prometheus and the Georgian mythology hero Amirani, among others. Tale Prometheus Carrying Fire by Jan Cossiers Pkharmat was a demi-god, or Nart, who loved and pitied his people, for they had no fire. The fire was kept by the cruel god Sela in his realm Anciennes Croyances des Ingouches et des Tchetchenes.Mariel Tsaro√Øeva to show the Narts his strength and power and to suppress them. Sela, the god of the stars, thunder and lightning, drove his fire-chariot about the heavens and criss-crossed the Sky, making a terrible noise. With his bow he fired bolts of lightning down to earth. Because they had no fire, Narts ate raw food and cold milk, and had no agriculture. For a long time the Narts led a miserable life. Sela knew it and was glad to see them so miserable as all the other gods were except Sela's wife Sata. Sata cared for Narts, but she was afraid of her husband. One day, there appeared a brave hero, Pkharmat. Pkharmat knew of the fire in hell () on the top of Mount Bashlam, thought to be a volcano. One day he decided to steal it. He forged without heat for his journey a coat, a sword and a shield out of bronze. He mounted his horse Turpal and began his journey. Sata took bird's form and alighted upon the mount's summit. She spoke to Pkharmat with a human voice: \\"O powerful Nart, you have not reached the summit of Bashlam by chance. You have come to fetch Fire.\\" Pkharmat answered \\"The people are in need of heat, of light. I shall only return to Earth to bring back Fire!\\". Having seen how strong the Nart and his horse were, Sata promised to help him in his quest for Fire. She advised him how to go about obtaining some, and warned him of the possible danger and of Sela's cruelty. Pkharmat also received help from his older brother, who Pkharmat informed of his quest. He gave his dear younger brother the carz, a reed-like plant with a soft-inner core, with a piece of coal in it. The coal was very much attracted to the fire, and it burned, and with its sparks boring into the carz, eventually boring eight holes of different length. Finally, the carz had been made into the reedpipe, which could make music, formerly unknown to the Narts. It was eventually given to the Narts. Pkharmat leaped over hell and seized a burning piece of wood. Sela was angered that a Nart acted against his will and tried to catch him. Because he was unable to reach him, he untied his skein in which he kept night. Pkharmat quickly lost his way in the darkness, but Sata came to help, guiding him in bird form. Sela saw Pkharmat escaping and untied two skeins in which he kept storm and terrible cold. Pkharmat overcome these difficulties and struggled to the great cave in all Narts were gathered together for protection from cold, storm and darkness. He gave them the fire and told \\"Here is Fire for you! Multiply and become a great tribe. Warm yourselves; illuminate your homes, the caves, the towers; cook, prepare food from now on. Rejoice!\\" After that Sela sent his servant cyclops Uja to punish the unfaithful Pkharmat. Uja chained Pkharmat to the peak of Mount Bashlam with chains of bronze. The falcon Ida comes to Pkharmat every morning. According to the will of Sela, it sits upon Pkharmat's knees and tears at his liver with his beak. Helping Characters Turpal Turpal was a legendary horse capable of outrunning lightning, which always roamed free, grazing among seven mountains, and drinking sea-water. Pkharmat wanted Turpal as his horse. Not even Sela's lightning bolts allowed Pkharmat to catch Turpal, which forced him to untie his skeins. Another miracle of Turpal's miracles was leaping over burning hell on Bashlam's peak when Pkharmat took fire. Turpal means Hero in Nakh languages and is used as a male name.Mount Bashlam Goddess Sata Pkharmat's brother  Mount Bashlam  Bashlam is known to most of the world as Mount Kazbek. Nowadays frozen Mount Bashlam is the place on top of which Sela's burning hell was placed. Bashlam is a dormant stratovolcano and one of the chief mountains of the Caucasus located in Georgia. (All detailed maps, from the Soviet topographic maps of the 1970s to the publications of recent years clearly show this peak falling precisely on the boundary.) Bashlam's last eruption was circa 750 BC. Events occurring in the legend may be memories of the chaos reigned in those days. Bashlam is the Nakh name of the Mount Kazbek, translated as Molten Mount. Bashlam has always been a sacred site for the Nakh and home of the Akkhi and Nart-Orsxtoi Tukkhums. Equivalents of Pkharmat in other traditions and their significance Pkharmat is usually identified as the Vainakh equivalent of similar figures in various other traditions (Greek, Armenian, Circassian, Abkhaz, Georgian, Ossete, Roman and so on). Comparisons There are notable differences between the different versions of the so-called \\"Prometheus\\". =Nature of god opposed by hero= In all versions, the \\"Prometheus\\" figure fights against a powerful god who has denied humanity fire. However, other characteristics of this god vary: Greek version- Prometheus and Zeus In the Greek version, the god Prometheus confronts is in fact the main head of the patriarchal pantheon, Zeus, who is almost always viewed in a positive light, as the loving All-Father, as the wise ruler of all, etc. The tale of Prometheus is one of the few instances where he is viewed negatively. Zeus guards the fire to keep humanity down, because he knows that once humanity has fire, it can make weapons, and progress, leading eventually to an ability to overthrow his rule. In some versions he also reasons that humanity is better off in ignorance and backwardness, without fire, often symbolized by its destructive nature contrasting its use for industry. Greek version- Kronos and Ouranos In another Greek tale, Ouranos, Zeus' grandfather was originally the ruler of the universe. He ruled with an iron fist and had a paranoid fear of being overthrown, leading him to oppress his own children, the First Generation Titans (6 males-including Kronos, the youngest- and 6 females). This tale did not involve any stealing of fire, but, rather, the overthrow of Ouranos by Kronos (Uranus by Saturn in the highly similar Latin version) brought the knowledge of agriculture to humankind. For Greeks and other Indo-Europeans, agriculture did not require fire, so the tales of how humankind acquired them are separate. Vainakh version For the most part, the Vainakh version is extremely similar to the Greek version of Prometheus. However, rather than the head of the pantheon, as Zeus is, Sela is a major god, but he is not the head of the pantheon (which would be Dela). Like Zeus, Sela owns thunder and lightning and uses lightning as a weapon. However, he shares certain characteristics with the Greek Uranus: he is the god of stars and the sky. Sela's personality also resembles that of Uranus. =Nature of Pkharmat/hero= The Pkharmat-character is variously a god, a demigod or a mortal. =Gifts given to man and significance= Vainakh Version Humankind attains both fire and agriculture as a result of the conflict between Pkharmat and Sela. Humankind also attains its first instrument- the reedpipe - from the affair, and with it, music, which in Vainakh culture is considered very important and was thought to have mystical properties. In addition to fire, agriculture, the reedpipe, and music, the origin of coal (given to Pkharmat while inside the carz) and how man obtains it is also explained. Greek Version Humankind is only given fire- with which it can make tools. This exemplifies the importance of the forge in Indo- European culture. =Pkharmat-character's Punishment (or lack of)= =People saved by Pkharmat-character= Relevance to the debate about the homeland of the Indo-European language family All the indigenous religious traditions with a figure equivalent to Pkharmat were practiced by peoples of the Caucasus and some Indo-European peoples (who sometimes resided in the Caucasus, as is the case with the Armenians and Ossetes, but often didn't, as is the case with the Greeks, Latins, Celtic peoples, etc.). This seems to support the hypothesis that the original homeland of the Indo- European peoples lay to the immediate north of the Caucasus touching both the Black and Caspian Seas and possibly extending north along the Volga some length as well as somewhat west into Ukraine. This hypothesis is now the most widely accepted, rather than the hypotheses that the Indo-European languages originated in the Anatolian plains, in the Armenian highland, India, Balkans or the ancestral Slavic homelands, or that they were a sprachbund. Comparison of the various versions of the stories also support that the original Indo- Europeans probably had more intense cultural exchange with the North Caucasus than the South Caucasus- the forms most close to the Indo-European versions of the tale are, in fact, the Circassian version and the Vainakh version. The Circassian and Abkhaz name for the hero is Pataraz, which shows very noticeable similarity to the Greek name Prometheus, which is similar to most other Indo-European versions; comparing these two, it is also possible to note Pkharmat's similarity. It is possible that Pataraz, Prometheus, Pkharmat and possibly others are all roots from the same original name.

He began his playing career with the Pittsburgh Athletic Club during the late 1890s and the Homestead Library & Athletic Club in 1901. In 1902, he played for the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League, who ended up winning the league title. Since the Stars consisted of the best professional players from western Pennsylvania at the time, it can be said that Shiring was considered the best at his position, center, in the region (and probably in the country). However Shring is best known for playing for the Massillon Tigers from 1903 until 1907. He finally served from 1907 to 1909 as a player-coach for the Pittsburgh Lyceum, Pittsburgh's last championship professional football team, until the 1970s. Playing career In 1901, Shiring was hired by the Homestead Library & Athletic Club to fill in for the injured Pete Overfield. From the moment he took the field, Shiring never left the Homestead line-up. The following season, he played alongside Christy Mathewson of the New York Baseball Giants for the Pittsburgh Stars of the first National Football League. In 1903, Shiring travelled to Ohio and continued his playing career with the Massillon Tigers of the Ohio League. He played for the Tigers until 1907 and served as a team captain for three of his four seasons in Massillon. A photograph of Shiring, as the Massillon captain, is currently hanging inside of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in Canton, Ohio. Massillon residents reportedly attempted to persuade Shiring to move to their town during and after his time Tigers, however he returned to Pennsylvania in 1907. That season, he became the player-coach for the Pittsburgh Lyceum football team. Throughout his career, Shiring refused to wear shoulder pads while playing. When asked why he refused to wear pads, Shiring responded by saying, \\"because they hinder me getting through the line.\\" His only padding concession was that he would wear shin guards. Role in the Canton Bulldogs‚ÄìMassillon Tigers betting scandal In 1906 Shiring was a figure in a betting scandal between the Massillon Tigers and the rival Canton Bulldogs. The Canton Bulldogs‚ÄìMassillon Tigers betting scandal was the first major scandal in professional football. It was the first known case of professional gamblers attempting to fix a professional sport. It refers to an allegation made by a Massillon newspaper charging the Bulldogs' coach, Blondy Wallace, and Tigers' end Walter East of conspiring to fix a two-game championship series between the two clubs. When the Tigers won the second and final game of a championship series and were named pro football's champions, Wallace was accused of throwing the game for Canton. However E. J. Stewart, the Tigers' coach and the editor of the Massillon Independent, charged that an actual attempt was made to bribe some of the Tiger players and that Wallace had been involved. His accusation was that an attempt had been made to bribe some Massillion players before the first game. According to Stewart, Tiny Maxwell and Shiring of Massillon had been solicited to throw the first game by East. Maxwell and Shiring then reported the offer to the Tigers' manager and the scandal ended before it began. The scandal was blamed for ruining professional football in Ohio until the mid-1910s. Outside of football Shring left school at the age of 13 and worked with his brothers at the Westinghouse Air Brake Company. The job resulted in him moving his family from Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania to nearby Wilmerding. He built his family's house in 1898, which was picked up and moved across the street in the 1960s, to make room for an expressway. The house remains in that location to this day. Shiring later spent 50 years as a borough official in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, where he served as the town's squire, which is the equivalent of a magistrate, in addition to being the elected Wilmerding's tax collector in 1903. He also opened a business, working in the insurance and real estate fields. He fathered nine children and remained close to his home in Wilmerding. On July 23, 1957 Shiring died in a Pittsburgh hospital.

He was the Mayor of Dunedin from 1897 to 1898. Early life Cargill was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1823; he was the seventh son of William Cargill, one of Otago's most prominent settlers. John Cargill was an elder brother. Edward Cargill was educated in Edinburgh and, after the family moved to England, at Norwich Grammar School and at Perone's School. He went to sea from age 14 and visited Australia and the Far East. In 1844, he settled in Ceylon and worked for the Bank of Western India. He was then a merchant in Ceylon and was in various partnerships. Cargill then went to Melbourne in Australia, where he stayed from 1855 to 1857 an importer of Eastern goods. Life in New Zealand Cargill moved to Dunedin in New Zealand - his father had previously moved there in 1847. He was initially in a partnership with Johnny Jones as a merchant and ship owner. They dissolved their partnership in 1861 and he partnered with his brother John. Their business prospered due to the Otago Gold Rush, but their premises burned down twice (in late 1861 and in early 1864). The business expanded and many ships were bought, but Cargill made significant losses during the recession in the 1880s, which caused him to retire from business in 1889. Political career Cargill represented the Bruce electorate from 1862 to 1865, when he resigned. He represented the Western electorate on the Otago Provincial Council (24 February 1862 ‚Äì 7 February 1862), and represented the Town of Dunedin electorate for two terms (22 May 1863 ‚Äì 10 January 1867; 13 March 1871 ‚Äì 13 March 1873). He was twice on the Executive Council of Otago Province and served as Provincial Secretary (19 August 1863 ‚Äì 15 September 1863; 13 April 1871 ‚Äì 2 June 1871). He was on the University of Otago board. He contested the in the Dunedin Central electorate, but was beaten by Frederick Fitchett. He was the Mayor of Dunedin from 1897 to 1898, when the 50th anniversary of the founding of the province of Otago was celebrated. Home and family Cargill's Castle in 2009 Cargill had built as his home the distinctive Cargill's Castle in Dunedin, known originally as \\"The Cliffs\\". Several kilometres south of the castle is Tunnel Beach, so named because this quiet beach is only accessible through a steeply sloping tunnel cut into the high cliffs by the Cargill family. The house was designed by Francis Petre, at the time a young architect; it is also very likely that Petre was the supervisor of the construction of the tunnel. While designing the house, Petre fell in love with Cargill's daughter Margaret. After a difficult courtship (due to Petre's staunch Catholicism and the Cargill family's equally staunch Presbyterianism) the couple were eventually permitted to marry, the wedding taking place in the villa's principal salon on 1 March 1881. Cargill died on 9 August 1903.

Membership Members include:SWA, Members & Brands, accessed 15 November 2017 * Diageo * Chivas Brothers * John Dewar & Sons * Drambuie Liqueur Company * The Edrington Group * William Grant & Sons * Whyte and Mackay * John Haig * Highland Distillers * Scotch Malt Whisky Society * Beam Suntory * William Teacher & Sons * John Walker & Sons Of these, Diageo and Chivas Brothers are the largest. Purpose The SWA's stated purpose is to promote, protect and represent the interests of the whisky industry in Scotland and around the world. Similar to the Portman Group, it also promotes responsible drinking, with campaigns to curb drinking to excess. History It was formed on 17 April 1942. It became a limited company in 1960. The SWA's members represent over 95% of Scotch whisky production, which encompasses over 2,500 brands around the world. The SWA led an unsuccessful challenge to the Scottish government's minimum alcohol price policy, enshrined in the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012. The UK's Supreme Court ruled on 15 November 2017 that the Act was not disproportionate to the stated policy aim of reducing alcohol misuse and overconsumption, and therefore not contrary to EU law.Supreme Court, Scotch Whisky Association and others (Appellants) v The Lord Advocate and another (Respondents) (Scotland) [2017 UKSC 76], 15 November 2017 Karen Betts, the SWA chief executive, said the association \\"accept[s] the Supreme Court's ruling\\".SWA, Response to MUP ruling, 15 November 2017 Achievements Scotch whisky has been a major industry for decades with exports totalling ¬£4.7 billion in 2018, according to the Association.

Some 2 million visits were recorded in 2018, a 6.1% increase over 2017 and a 56% increase compared to 2010. Some 68 distilleries operate visitor centres in Scotland and another eight accept visits by appointment.

Biography His first teacher, with whom he started at the age of five, was his paternal grandfather. Even as a child and adolescent, he became acquainted with a vast repertoire, and developed a special preference for music by Robert Schumann. In 1964 he began studying with Lode Backx, at first privately; later, after graduating from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven as a pharmacist (1970), at the Queen Elisabeth College of Music at Waterloo, from which he graduated in 1974, and at the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp, which granted him the ‚ÄúHoger Diploma‚Äù, its highest degree, summa cum laude in 1975. Another major influence on Jozef De Beenhouwer was David Kimball, with whom he took private lessons in Florence between 1991 and 1998. As a soloist, both in works for piano solo and in works with orchestra, he has played concerts and made radio and television recordings in many European countries (Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Portugal, France, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, the Czech Republic, in South-Korea and in the United States. He has accompanied singers like Ria Bollen, Nina Stemme, Robert Holl and Werner Van Mechelen. As a chamber musician he has played with Belgian musicians like the clarinetist Walter Boeykens, the pianist Daniel Blumenthal, the violinist Guido Deneve, the violist Leo Deneve, the cellist Edmond Baeyens, the Spiegel Quartet, as well as international partners like the violinists Ning Kam and Alexander Kramarov, the violist Hartmut Lindemann, the cellist Marien van Staalen and the Panocha Quartet. With Kees H√ºlsmann and Marien van Staalen he forms the Robert Schumann Trio. For ten years (1986‚Äì1996) Jozef De Beenhouwer was an official accompanist at the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition for violin and singing. He is a regular guest of the Brahms Festival at M√ºrzzuschlag, Austria. Jozef De Beenhouwer's recordings include works by Johannes Brahms, Hans Pfitzner, Franz Schubert, and by the German romantic composer Ludwig Schuncke, whose G minor sonata he was the first to perform. But his international reputation rests mainly on his Schumann expertise. Basing himself on Robert Schumann's autograph, whose pages, besides being hard to read, had also been wrongly bound, he managed to reconstruct and complete an unfinished Concertsatz in D minor, dated 1839 (world premiere in Vienna, 1986, with the Vienna Symphony conducted by Peter G√ºlke). He completed and orchestrated a Konzertsatz in F minor by Clara Schumann (world premiere Zwickau, 1986, with the orchestra of the Theater of Zwickau conducted by Albrecht Hofmann). He was the first to record all of Clara Schumann's works for piano solo (three CDs). He is now regularly invited to be a member of the jury of the International Robert Schumann Competition for Piano, and occasionally of other international piano competitions as well. Jozef De Beenhouwer is also an ardent champion of music by Belgian, especially Flemish, composers, whose works he plays and records regularly. When these have remained unpublished he deciphers them from the manuscript and sometimes ends up publishing them himself. (See the bibliography and discography, below.) On tour in the US, Jozef De Beenhouwer has played a number of concerts as a soloist and with the violinist Janet Packer, and their programs have all featured American composers, such as Irving Fine, Amy Beach, Gardner Read, Andrew Imbrie and Vittorio Rieti. Jozef De Beenhouwer succeeded his teacher Lode Backx as a professor of piano at the Royal Flemish Conservatory of Antwerp in 1983 and he was also in charge of a chamber music course at the conservatory until 2013, when he reached the mandatory retirement age. But until 2020 he continued as a guest professor, teaching, together with the mezzo-soprano Lucienne Van Deyck, the course of Art Songs (a term of which was devoted to German Lieder). From 1990 until 2015 he was the artistic director of the Brussels Lunchtime Concerts. Besides in music, Jozef De Beenhouwer is also interested in literature and in painting. His knowledge of literature, particularly of German Romanticism, stands him in good stead in his Schumann studies and in his Art Song class. And he has published the standard monograph on the Belgian-Dutch painter Henry Luyten as well as a book on that painter's school. Prizes and Honors *Jozef De Beenhouwer has twice been rewarded with a Caecilia Prize (an award bestowed by the Belgian Association of Music Critics), in 1984 for a recording of works by Peter Benoit and in 1986 for a recording of works by Joseph Ryelandt. *For his endeavors on behalf of the works of Robert and Clara Schumann, the city of Zwickau awarded him its 1993 Robert Schumann Prize. *On November 29, 2010, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award of Klara, the classical-music channel of the Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep.

Plot In the Beginning is the story about the travels and travails of the tribe of Abraham (Martin Landau). Set around the year 2000 B.C., the narrative opens with \\"Genesis 12,\\" wherein the has told Abraham and company to leave their country to a land of milk and honey to be named later. In order to keep up the morale of his followers while on the road, Abraham gives a sermon that sums up God's creation of the universe. By illustrating this sermon with stock footage and special-effects shots, the producers attempt to make a connection between sermons of old and popular entertainments of today. From there, the twists and turns of the Old Testament are treated like a soap opera. Family dramas take center stage, whether it's God testing Abraham by telling him to kill his son in sacrifice, Joseph gaining power in Egypt after being sold to slave traders by his brothers, or one of the many other stories of brothers fighting (Cain and Abel, Isaac and Ishmael, etc.).

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. The theory addresses instances of apparent self-view confirmation strivings and details an economical description of why these behaviors occur. Focusing on the importance of the self-view and rational thought, (see self- esteem; self concept; self knowledge) Raison oblige theory (ROT) accounts for the evidence supporting SVT including the well documented seemingly mal- adaptive self verifying behaviors. * SVT states that a person is actively motivated to confirm their existing self view regardless of the objective accuracy or valence of that view. In other words, a person wants to confirm their currently held self views above and beyond wanting this information to be accurate or positive.Swann, W. B., Jr., Rentfrow, P. J., & Guinn, J. (2002). Self-verification: The search for coherence. In M. Leary and J. Tagney, Handbook of self and identity: Guilford, New York.

Is identity per se irrelevant? A contrarian view of self-verification effects. Depression and Anxiety, 0, 1-11 * The fundamentals of ROT are that people are obliged by reason to accept information that is congruent with their currently held self views and reject information that is not. The theory challenges a self-verification motive, stating that people do not want to self-verify, they simply convey, through behaviour, cognitions that accurately and honestly reflect their own self views. ROT was developed by Aiden P. Gregg (2006). Overview Self verification Self-verifying behavior includes any action which ultimately coincides with and reinforces existing self-views. *Motivation to self-enhance causes a person with positive self-views to seek positive information: This verifies positivity. *People with negative self-views, including those diagnosed with depression, show a preference for negative information: This verifies negativity.

For example; Depressed people opt to receive negative information despite positivity striving of the self-enhancement motive. This has therefore been interpreted as the result of motivation to self verify. (Giesler et al., 1996) Origins of ROT The theory originated from criticism of the evidence supporting SVT. Gregg (2007) disputed that the evidence was weak and circumstantial, and importantly could be better and more economically explained via Raison oblige theory. Both theories acknowledged the abundance of evidence showing that people behave in a way that confirms their self-view, even when this reinforcement is seemingly maladaptive. As with most psychological theories, observation of behavior provided the most compelling evidence for self verification theory. ::* However, just because a person acts in a certain way does not necessarily dictate that the usually related motive for this behavior is responsible or indeed that the person wants to act this way. Self-defeating behavior such as drug abuse, which is clearly not in the person‚Äôs best interest, does not certify that there is a motive to self-defeat. ::* In such an instance it is suggested that the person does not want to act against their best interests, but that they want immediate relief from negative affect (Baumeister & Scher, 1988).Baumeister, R. F., Scher, S. J. (1988). Self-defeating behavior patterns among normal individuals: review and analysis of common self destructive tendencies. Psychology Bulletin, 104, 3‚Äì22. ROT, unlike SVT, does not explain the observed behavior in terms of a motive. Instead it suggests that an active cognitive process obliges a person to behave in a way that honestly reflects their currently held self-views. Underlying assumptions Rationality is often overlooked when considering the causes of exhibited behaviors. When compared to the motives of self-enhancement, self-improvement and self-assessment the effects of rationality might be assumed to be small. However, Gregg (2007) outlines that ‚Äúrationality is pervasive and motives merely qualify it‚Äù. *ROT draws upon the ability of ration to influence our behaviors and cognitions. *Evidence for the effects of rationality are easily seen yet often overlooked due to the compared power of motives. However, if rationality did not strongly influence cognition, self-assessment would rarely be accurate and grandiose delusions would be common. As a result, self-enhancement and self-improvement would also be hindered as people would have an inaccurate self-concept and thus be unaware of whether they needed to enhance or improve. Without some sort of obligation to reasonable thought it is unlikely anyone would have an accurate self-concept or strive to make something of themselves. * This assumption underlies ROT and is the rationale for suggesting that there is a plausible alternative explanation for the evidence of self verifying behaviors. Hypothetical situation When given the option to interact with person (A) who shares my self views or person (B) who does not, I will opt for person A. *ROT explains that this choice is based on whether I can earnestly believe the information to be true and representative of myself. Despite the desire for positive information to be true, if I cannot subjectively believe it then I will ignore it. This hypothetical preference for people who share my self view and avoidance of those who don't has been empirically replicated many times (e.g. Swann, 92;Swann, W. B., Jr., Wenzlaff, R. M., Krull, D. S., & Pelham, B. W. (1992). The allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 101, 293-306 swann 03; Gregg 07) Importantly, this behavior in which we create a world which shares our self-views does not necessarily demonstrate a motive to do so (Gregg, 07). In fact, if rationality were removed it is likely we would not adhere to self views at all. Instead people would be able to choose a self view they liked and exhibit behaviors accordingly. *Every healthy person is aware of reality and adheres to an unspoken set of rules of reason permitting them to act in accordance with their physical and mental ability. *Perceptions of the world around us are bound by rational thought and evidence. Raison Oblige theory extends this binding to reason into the conceptions of our selves, i.e. self view. Negative and positive self views Self-esteem Self-esteem has a very strong influence on a person‚Äôs self-view. A person with high self-esteem is more likely to have a positive self-view, whereas a person with low self-esteem is more likely to have a negative self-view. Many studies that seemingly provide evidence for a self-verifying motive use self-esteem as a variable to demonstrate that people confirm a self-view that corresponds to their level of self-esteem. However, one can argue that this behavioral evidence is circumstantial and that the correlation does not demonstrate motivation. *If a person with low self-esteem confirmed a self-view congruent to that of low self-esteem, it does not necessarily provide evidence for motivation to confirm a self-view. *ROT claims that people are aware of their self-views and believe them to be accurate. As a result, they answer questionnaires honestly, and report their self-views as they truly see them due to an obligation to reason. people may not want self-verifying information to be true of them and may want others to view them positively rather than negatively. Further research needs to be undertaken to fully investigate the relationship between self views and self-esteem. (see. Gregg, 2007) ::*Do people with low self-esteem want critical feedback to be true; are they motivated? ::*Do people with low self-esteem actually want their self view to be accurate, or would they prefer a more positive self view? ROT predicts that people with low self-esteem are bound by reason to confirm their existing self view but that they don‚Äôt necessarily like it (Gregg & De Waal-Andrews, 2007).Gregg, A. P., & De Waal-Andrews W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK. If a motivation to self-verify were present then people with low self-esteem would not care about what their self-view was, they would instead focus on actively trying to confirm it. Depression Depression is accompanied by very low self-esteem and has therefore been a topic of strong interest for those investigating self verifying behaviors. Depression is always accompanied by low self-esteem but having low self-esteem does not necessarily mean you are depressed. It argued that those suffering with depression, or with generally low negative self-views, will actively seek negative feedback in order to confirm their self-view; they find it more favourable. Giesler et al. (1996)Giesler, R. B., Josephs, R. A., & Swann, W. B. Jr. (1996). Self- verification in clinical depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 105, 358‚Äì368. tested this prediction by classifying participants into three separate groups; high self-esteem, low self-esteem and depressed individuals. When offered a choice of positive or negative feedback, depressed individuals chose to receive negative feedback 82% of the time, suggesting a strong desire to negatively re-affirm their self view. The seeking of negative feedback in order to self-verify has thus been argued to maintain a depressive state. ROT challenges this interpretation and suggests that the observed behavior and maintenance of depressive state is caused by an obligation to confirm a depressive self-concept. This particular study, and many others like it can be reinterpreted using ROT. The choice of negative feedback reflects the obligation to choose information consistent with an honestly held self view. Correlations do not equal causation; The evidence for SVT assumptions of motivation drawn from studies on depression could be circumstantial and therefore do not provide explicit proof of a motive to self-verify. =Depression, Motivation and Desire= Motivation is interlinked with desire. I am hungry therefore I am motivated to eat food; I want to eat. In SVT studies of depressed persons they are asked whether they would like to receive favorable or unfavorable feedback on their personality. In concurrence with SVT and ROT predictions they chose the unfavorable feedback due to a negative self-view.Swann, W. B., Jr., Pelham, B. W., & Krull, D. S. (1989). Agreeable fancy or disagreeable truth? How people reconcile their self- enhancement and self-verification needs. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 57, 782-791 These studies demonstrate that self-enhancement striving has been overridden by a separate cognitive process. If a person with high self-esteem confirms their self-view this may not be self-verification as this is more likely to be due to the self-enhancement motive. Therefore, SVT and ROT studies tend to focus on depressive participants who's verification of negative information can not be attributed to self-enhancement. *However, Recent findings show that people with depression and high self-esteem both want to receive favorable feedback more than critical feedback.Gregg, A. P., & De Waal-Andrews, W. (2007). Choices for, and perceptions of, global and specific hypothetical feedback of differential valence. Unpublished raw data, School of Psychology, University of Southampton, UK. ::*This suggests that people do not want to receive feedback that confirms their self-view. A lack of desire implies that motivation is not responsible for self-verification. ::*Gregg & De Waal-Andrews (2007) also show that the lower a participant's self-esteem, the less they anticipated liking critical feedback, and the less keen they were for it to be true, supporting ROT predictions. Relationships One example that is well explained by Raison Oblige Theory is why people stay in abusive relationships. According to Rusbult and Martz (1995) more than 40% of women who seek help from a shelter when being abused by their partner then return to living with their partner and remain in the abusive relationship.Rusbult, C. E., & Martz, J. M. (1995). Remaining in an abusive relationship: An investment model analysis of nonvoluntary dependence. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 21(6), 558-571. Self-verification theory would explain this by the abused partner‚Äôs need to self-verify that the way they are being treated is deserved, in order to establish an accurate self-concept (Swann & Ely, 1984).Swann, W. B., Jr., & Ely, R. J. (1984). A battle of wills: Self-verification versus behavioral confirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 46, 1287-1302. However the alternative explanation from Raison Oblige Theory is that an abused individual will rationalise the situation they are in and come to the conclusion that they themselves are in some way causing the abuse. This leads to the honest belief that they deserve the abuse and causes feelings of worthlessness. This results in the abused individual remaining loyal to their partner and failing to seek help, as they believe the abuse is their fault and that they need to improve in some way in order that the abuse will stop. Raison Oblige Theory also explains that the abused partner feels that they will gain no benefit from leaving an abusive relationship, as they see the abuse as their fault. This also explains why the abused individual may defend their partner should anyone outside the relationship become aware of the abuse. Evidence The mind is difficult to study, often multiple theories can explain a single phenomenon. A theory which explains said phenomenon more efficiently or can explain additional behaviors is considered the more plausible theory. *There is no explicit evidence that proves the existence of a motive to self-verify. However, there is a vast expanse of evidence to show that people are obligated to reason in their thoughts. Motivation and affect Behavior does not always reflect motivation; ::*we do things we don't want to do but are obliged to do (e.g. giving up leisure time to do work) ::*we voluntarily refrain from doing things that we want to do (e.g. making up qualifications to secure a job we want) ::*These examples demonstrate that behavior does not always reflect motivation. However, they do demonstrate a cognitive overruling of desire/motive. *Motivation incurs negative affect when conditions are not met; I want to improve, I fail; I feel bad. *Striving to self verify should have an influence on affect. *A person with a negative self view should therefore be less disturbed by critical feedback than a person with high self-esteem. ::* Depressed: Critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive but bolsters their self verification motive. ::* High self-esteem :critical feedback negatively influences their self enhancing motive(ego) and their self verification motive. ::*High self-esteemed people should be more emotionally disturbed by critical feedback than depressed people. However, this is not the case (Jones, 1975;Caplan, R. D., & Jones, K. W. (1975). Effects of work load, role ambiguity and Type A personality on anxiety, depression and heart rate. Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, 713-719. Taylor & Brown, 1988.Taylor, S. E., & Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210. Obligation to ration *Day to day examples of obligation to reason; Grandiose delusions are rare. *We accept new self views after a change in appearance or capabilities; we rationalize changes and challenges. *People are reasonable in thought, without reason grandiose delusions would have prevented the existence of our species; I can't be killed; I can fight this mammoth alone; I can attack this man without consequence; I am the best person in the world. =The effect of Ration on motivation= Self-assessment is bound to rational perception; ::* I believe what is subjectively possible. ::* Assessment is based on accurate perception, not subjective desire: Grandiose delusions are rare Self-enhancement is bound to rational perception; ::* The above-average effect is bound to the limits of subjective plausibility (Gregg, 2007). ::* specific compared traits succumb to the effect much less because people are aware of their ability compared to others. Commonly held traits can be exaggerated due to a larger latitude of comparison.

Admission procedure In line with the policy of the Iranian government to remove University Entrance Examination (Konkoor) and facilitate students' access to the academic environment, the university has set up a procedure to enroll students without exams in fields which are announced every year in the website of the university. As for other fields of study, the university recruits applicants through the National Entrance Exam which is administered by the National Organization for Educational Testing affiliated to Iran's Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Old campus The university main campus includes a five-storey building (Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences), a two-storey building (Faculty of Technical Engineering), a four-storey building (education space), a two-storey building (education space), a two-storey building (headquarters and chemistry lab), a two-storey library, an internet site with 90 computer sets and two dining halls for boys and girls. The equipment in the old campus was transferred to the new campus in the second semester of the 2011-2012 academic year. The only students who use the old campus are the students of architecture who attend their workshops (atelier) in the two-storey building of the old faculty of technical engineering and the boys' dining hall used now as the workroom. The university old kitchen is still in the same site as it was. The construction of the main campus of the university started in 2006. It covers a land area of 60000 square meters, which is located in Sheikh Fazlollah Nouri Street in the beginning of the Nour-Chamestan road. The main campus was inaugurated in the first semester of the 2011-2012 academic year, after which all the facilities were moved to this place. New campus and master plan The plan to construct the Main Campus of the university, spanning a land property of 6000 square meters in the vicinity of Izlamic Azad University of Nour and located in the beginning of Nour-Chamestan Road, was launched in 2006. The plan outlined a multi-phase project, the first phase of which was completed after five years of continuous efforts at the end of the first semester of the 2011-2012 academic year. The flooring and paving of the Main Campus were finished in early 2013 and the gymnasium, architecture atelier and main entrance of the university are under construction. The Main Campus consists of the central building (faculties, administrative offices and classes), dining hall for boys and girls, central library, study hall, lab building, amphitheater to hold conferences, internet site with 90 computer sets, language lab and prayer halls for men and women. Student Counseling Center The Student Counseling Center of the university was established in the winter of 2011 under the auspices of the Vice-Chancellery for Student and Cultural Affairs. The center offers counseling, psychological and mental health services to the students and university staff. The activities of the Center are classified into two categories: * counseling and treatment, offering counseling services to the clients in person * mental health, including publishing brochures, CDs, and booklets, and holding educational workshops and seminars Technology and Internet access Technological services offered by the university include the Student and Professor Portal (used for internet-based unit-credit selection, getting access to the scores portal, printouts of student cards for examination entry, online payments, teacher evaluation) and the Online Meal Booking Automation System (able to process the multi-functional electronic cards of the students). The university has been awarded the 'e-NAMAD' i.e. the Electronic Trust Mark, by the Electronic Trade Promotion Center. The Administrative Automation System used for paperless correspondence has been active since 2009 to undertake all the in-house and off-campus academic correspondence. The high-speed wireless internet is available to all the students and professors throughout the campus and rooms. The website of the university offers facilities like access to the internet systems for unit-credit selection, meal booking, registration for competitions and conferences, appointments for counseling and university news and updates.

He has lived and worked in Germany since 1991. He has various attributes in stage performance: concert singer, opera singer, reciter and actor. In the theater, he played the part of Estragon in Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett; recited the monologue \\"A Terceira Margem do Rio\\" based on the text by Jo√£o Guimar√£es Rosa and, as a reciter, together with the Japanese organist Aya Yoshida, presented the work \\"Alice au pays de l'orgue\\" by Jean Guillou for narrator and organ. However, his work emphasizes the interpretation of art songs. Together with the pianist Maximiliano de Brito, Renato Mismetti has performed in the most renowned concert halls in Europe, such as Konzerthaus Berlin, Berlin State Opera, Cuvilli√©s Theatre, Munich, Gewandhaus, Leipzig, Alte Oper, Frankfurt, Musikhalle Hamburg, Konzerthaus Vienna, Schlosstheater Sch√∂nbrunn, Vienna, Salle Gaveau, Paris, St. John's, Smith Square, London, besides the Amazon Theatre Manaus, o Theatro da Paz, Bel√©m and also the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, New York.

Renato Mismetti has worked diligently in divulging Brazilian music overseas and, because of this the press has frequently referred to him as the ambassador of Brazilian culture. He was classified as one of the supreme interpreters of Brazilian art song by the magazine New Yorker Music Review. Mismetti's interest in working together with composers became evident early on, during his university studies when he prepared songs by Camargo Guarnieri together with the composer, who, in turn, later on watched the performance of the baritone in the title-role in his opera \\"Pedro Malazarte\\", classifying it as brilliant and saying that Renato Mismetti was the best Malazarte he had ever seen. Various renowned composers such as Marlos Nobre, Jorge Antunes, Almeida Prado, Edino Krieger, Kilza Setti, Ronaldo Miranda, Osvaldo Lacerda, Gilberto Mendes, Ricardo Tacuchian, Violeta Dinescu and Jens Joneleit have dedicated compositions especially to this Brazilian Duo, who presented them to the world for the first time in important historical theaters such as the Markgr√§fliches Opernhaus in Bayreuth and the Schlosstheater New Palace (Potsdam). In 2001, in a public letter, the Mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, publicly welcomed the two Brazilian musicians when they presented a recital at the Berlin Konzerthaus. In 2004, the Mayor of Bremen, Henning Scherf, repeated this act when the concert \\"Disenchanted Amazon\\" was presented in the Bremen Municipal Government Palace. In the German edition of Wikipedia, Renato Mismetti appears in the list of famous classical music singers. Recently, based on the famous text by Ant√¥nio Castro Alves, \\"Navio Negreiro\\", the composer Siegrid Ernst, wrote \\"Memento\\" in which Renato Mismetti and Maximiliano de Brito, together with other musicians gave the first world performance with huge success. Mismetti also develops great interdisciplinary projects involving various art aspects and fields.

Shootings  The gunman opened fire in two locations across the island of Saipan. His first location was Kannat Tabla, where he shot and killed four people (two men, a four-year-old boy, and a two-year-old girl) at a shooting range at 11:21 a.m. A four-year-old girl, who was the daughter of one of the slain men and also the older sister of the deceased girl, was also shot in the chest, but she survived her injury. He then drove several miles to Marpi, where about 60 people were taking pictures of the area. There, he fired his rifle at a group of South Korean tourists from inside his van, wounding five of them, two of whom were children. From there, he traveled to the popular tourist destination Last Command Post Park, which was the location of Japan's last base for military commanders during World War II. There, he set his van on fire and then walked to the edge of Banzai Cliff, firing along the way. Upon arriving along the edge of the cliff, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with his rifle as police closed in. A search of the van's remains recovered three additional rifles and more than 750 rounds of ammunition.\\"Saipan Shooting: Gunman Opens Fire On Pacific Island; 5 Dead\\"\\"Authorities: Gunman kills 4, wounds 6 on Saipan\\" The shootings lasted for an approximate half-hour.

He was also living at the shooting range at the time of the shootings. It had been reported that he left a suicide note behind detailing his motive as a \\"business deal gone bad\\". Police officials believed that the shootings, reported as premeditated, were sparked by a frustration over financial issues.

The commonwealth has never experienced a tragic situation like this, and we are saddened by the appalling action of a single individual that has caused so much harm to our peaceful island community.\\" Saipan Congressman Gregorio Sablan also commented, \\"The security we take for granted in our island homes has been broken by this senseless act of violence.\\" Lieutenant Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, Eloy Inos, told reporters, \\"This is an unfortunate but isolated incident. It happened for reasons unbeknownst to us, but we can handle this type of situation.\\" Following the announcement that South Korean tourists were among the injured, this led to fears that tourism rates would drop at Saipan. Schools across the island were shut down for the day for safety reasons.

It can be used to study topics such as ozone depletion and tropospheric pollution, and was one of the models used the IPCC report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere . It incorporates a choice of detailed chemistry schemes for the troposphere or stratosphere, and an optional chemical data assimilation scheme. The original model code, called the Toulouse Off-line Model of Chemistry And Transport (TOMCAT), was written by Martyn Chipperfield at M√©t√©o France. \\"Off-line\\" in this sense describes the fact that although the meteorological data (wind components and other fields) which are used as input to the CTM typically derive from a general circulation model (GCM), the CTM is run as a separate program outside of a GCM; this is as distinct from a chemistry simulation scheme which runs within a GCM, in which the simulated chemical distributions, e.g. of ozone, can provide feedback on the meteorology via the GCM's radiation scheme. A version called the Single Layer Isentropic Model of Chemistry And Transport (SLIMCAT) was developed in 1995. This used a level of constant potential temperature (or equivalently, of constant specific entropy, hence isentropic), exploiting the fact that due to approximate conservation of energy, atmospheric motions are approximately adiabatic and hence air parcels remain on isentropic levels on short timescales. A diabatic heating scheme was later added, to allow for multiple isentropic levels with transport between them on longer timescales, although the name \\"SLIMCAT\\" has remained despite the multiple levels. The two programs are now maintained as a single code base, which runs in Fortran, and has been parallelised. TOMCAT has been further extended to include a detailed treatment of aerosol. GLOMAP (Global Model of Aerosol Processes) simulates a wide range of aerosol species including black carbon, sulfate, sea spray, soil dust, and secondary organic aerosol. The primary purpose of TOMCAT/GLOMAP is to simulate aerosol radiative forcing and the impact of aerosol on climate.

The device usually consists of LED lights that are embedded into the roadway alongside the crosswalk and are oriented to face oncoming traffic. When a pedestrian approaches the crosswalk, the system is activated and the LED lights begin to flash simultaneously. These lights are programmed to flash for a period of time that is sufficient for an average pedestrian to cross. History The concept for embedded pavement flashing light system was conceived by pilot Michael Harrison in Santa Rosa, California in 1992 after a friend was involved in a pedestrian accident. He based it on his experience with airport runway lights embedded in pavement. Types There are two different types of embedded pavement flashing light systems, passive and active. These types differ on how the system is activated. With a passive system, the pedestrian activates the device merely by walking up to the crosswalk. This is accomplished by using one of several motion detection devices. These include microwave, motion sensors, video detection, pressure plates, or a light trip beam. With an active system, the device is usually activated by a button that a pedestrian pushes in order to cross. These active systems are generally similar to lighted pedestrian signs at traffic intersections. Because many pedestrians may not realize that they need to press a button to activate the system, it is generally recommended to install a passive system. Effectiveness Compared with other types of warning devices, the effectiveness of the embedded pavement flashing light system seem to be high. When approaching a crosswalk with an embedded pavement flashing light system, drivers are more apt to slow down and yield to pedestrians than when drivers approach a crosswalk with another type of lighted warning device. Also, compared to a crosswalk with no warning device, drivers are more likely to slow down and yield to pedestrians when the embedded pavement flashing light system is in place.

Population: Municipally, Novoye Chaplino is subordinated to Providensky Municipal District. In 2010, a law was passed abolishing the municipal rural settlement of Novoye Chaplino. The village continues to exist, but is now municipally part of Providenia Urban Settlement. History Origins The village was founded in 1960,Strogoff p.135 although some sources state that it was founded in 1958 as a result of the merging of several nearby coastal villages into one. Villages such as Unazik (lit \\"Bewhiskered\\" in Yupik and formerly an important local whaling centre), Kivak (lit. \\"Green Glade\\" in Yupik and the site of an ancient settlement several thousand years old) and Plover, as well as settlements from much further up the coast such as the now abandoned village of Naukan. Post-soviet history Novoye Chaplino is a good example of how following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the outflow of Russian migrants allowed indigenous people to take up senior administrative posts in the local administration.Krupnik and Vakhtin (2002) p.14 In a similar situation to other Chukotkan villages such as Markovo,Chereshev, p.13 During Soviet times, about 25% of the population of the village were non-indigenous in-comers. Despite being in the minority, they formed the majority of senior employees in areas such as the state farm, village administration and technical services. In-comers also dominated senior positions at the school including the principal, boarding-school supervisore, administrative director, bookkeeper and 11 out of the 18 licensed teachers. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, indigenous people managed to gain more influence in their key local services. By 1995, in-comer departure was almost complete. Whereas over 110 people out of a population of 460 were non-indigenous in 1986, barely 30 remained nine years later, and those were mostly married to indigenous villagers. Although the economic situation meant that a number of local industries had closed or had truncated staff numbers, in the state farm, three quarters of the top officials were indigenous people and over two thirds (of the admittedly smaller) school were either Chukchi or Yupik. Recent history On September 10, 2010, a law was passed abolishing Novoye Chaplino and Sireniki at municipal level.Law #45-OZ Novoye Chaplino as an entity continues to exist, but it is no longer a rural settlement on its own, but simply an inhabited locality within Provideniya urban settlement. The right of the village to local administration was removed and such responsibilities were taken over by Provideniya municipal administration on January 1, 2011. Provideniya municipal administration also took control of all municipal property, all municipal property rights and all local budgets on this date. Demographics The population according to the most recent census data, prior to the abolition of the rural settlement was 419, of whom 206 were male and 213 female. This represents a significant increase on a 2008 estimate of about 330,Novoye Chaplino - Beringia Park Website but is flat against a 2003 estimate of 422,Red Cross Chukotka - Providensky District Page (Archived) more than 90% of which were Chukchi or Siberian Yupik. Culture and economy Provideniya, Provideniya Bay, and surrounding area The village is populated mainly by Yupik, and whaling is the main source of employment in the area. The Chaplino hot-springs are an important local attraction. There are other springs near the former village of Kivak, but these are less popular due to their isolation. Climate Novoye Chaplino has a Tundra climate (ET)McKnight and Hess, pp.235-7 because the warmest month has an average temperature between and .

Early life and education Johnson received a B.A. in mathematics at Georgia Tech and earned his Ph.D. in operations research from the University of California at Berkeley in 1965. He was student of George Dantzig Career In the 1950s, Dr. Ellis Johnson served as director of the Operations Research Office of the Johns Hopkins University. Later, after three years at Yale University, Johnson joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, where he founded and managed the Optimization Center from 1982 until 1990, when he was named IBM Fellow. In 1980-1981, Johnson visited the University of Bonn, Germany, as recipient of the Humboldt Senior Scientist Award. From 1990 to 1993, Johnson began teaching and conducting research at Georgia Tech, where he co-founded and co-directed the Logistics Engineering Center with Professor George Nemhauser. He joined the Georgia Tech faculty in 1994. Johnson's research interests in logistics include crew scheduling and real-time repair, fleet assignment and routing, distribution planning, network problems, and combinatorial optimization. Awards and honors Johnson has received a number of awards, including the following: * 2009 Fellow, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics * 2002 Fellow, INFORMS * 2000 John von Neumann Theory Prize, INFORMS * 1990 IBM Fellow * 1988 National Academy of Engineers * 1985 George B. Dantzig Prize for his research in mathematical programming * 1983 Lanchester Prize for his paper with Crowder and Manfred W. Padberg * 1980 Senior Scientist Award, Alexander von Humboldt Foundation John von Neumann Theory Prize Johnson received the John von Neumann Theory Prize jointly with Manfred W. Padberg in recognition of his fundamental contributions to integer programming and combinatorial optimization. Their work combines theory with algorithm development, computational testing, and solution of hard real-world problems in the best tradition of Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In their joint work with Crowder and in subsequent work with others, they showed how to formulate and solve efficiently very large-scale practical 0-1 programs with important applications in industry and transportation. The selection committee cited among Johnson's contribution three important and influential papers he produced in the early seventies‚Äîtwo of them with Ralph Gomory‚Äîwhich developed and extended in significant ways the group theoretic approach to integer programming pioneered by Gomory. In particular, Johnson showed how the approach can be extended to the case of mixed integer programs. As an outgrowth of this work, Johnson contributed decisively to the development of what became known as the subadditive approach to integer programming. Still in the seventies, in a seminal paper co-authored with Jack Edmonds, Johnson showed how several basic optimization problems defined on graphs can be solved in polynomial time by reducing them to weighted matching problems. One example is finding minimum T-joins (i.e., edge sets whose only endpoints of odd degree are those in a specified vertex set T). An important special case is the seemingly difficult problem of finding a shortest tour in a graph that traverses every edge at least once, known as the Postman problem. The stark contrast between the polynomial solvability of this problem and the intractability of the traveling salesman problem in which the tour is supposed to traverse vertices rather than edges, helped focus attention on the phenomenon so typical of combinatorial structures: two seemingly very similar problems turn out in reality to be vastly different.

The charity regularly distributes tonnes of food to needy West Australians, many of whom live on the streets, and organises an annual Christmas Appeal. He was also the racing chaplain in Perth In 2006 Father Brian was awarded Western Australian Senior of the year for his humanitarian work. Father Brian has collected donations from the Western Australian community to support humanitarian efforts for Australian disasters like Cyclone Tracy, 2003 Canberra bushfires and the 2009 Victorian Bushfires. In addition to his work with Western Australian communities, he travelled overseas extensively. He made thirty trips to places such as East Timor, Bangladesh, Chechnya, Thailand and Iraq to help people in need, particularly children in some of the world's most devastated areas. Internationally Father Brian has organised relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, for victims of the Bali bombings and for children affected by Chernobyl disaster. He travelled to the Ukraine and the Chernobyl area four times over sixteen years to provide support and love to those who were shunned by many. During his visits to help Chernobyl victims Father Brain suffered radiation poisoning, probably through consuming contaminated food, it is thought that this was cause of his terminal lymphocytic cancer and adenocarcinoma.

It is a part of the High Tech High organization. Opening in 2007, with its initial class consisting of only 150 freshmen, the school has since expanded, with more than five hundred and fifty students attending. Each year, there had been a new class added. In the 2008-2009 school year, it was sophomores, in the 2009-2010 school year it was juniors, and in the 2010-2011 school year it became seniors. It is one of only two High Tech High schools to be built from the ground up with the other being High Tech High Chula Vista. The school follows the same type of personalized, college preparatory, project-based learning characterized at other High Tech High schools. Mission and goals High Tech High‚Äôs mission is to develop and support innovative public schools where all students develop the academic, workplace, and citizenship skills for post-secondary success. *Serve a student body that mirrors the ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the local community. *Integrate technical and academic education to prepare students for post-secondary education in both high tech and liberal arts fields. *Increase the number of educationally disadvantaged students in math and engineering who succeed in high school and post-secondary education. *Graduate students who will be thoughtful, engaged citizens. Curriculum All HTH students pursue a rigorous curriculum that provides the foundation for entry and success at the University of California and elsewhere, as well as success in the world of work. Schools articulate common expectations for learning that value 21st century skills, the integration of hands and minds, and the merging of academic disciplines. Assessment is performance-based: all students develop projects, solve problems, and present findings to community panels. All students are required to complete an academic internship, a substantial senior project, and a personal digital portfolio. Teachers employ a variety of approaches to accommodate diverse learners, and recognize the value of having students from different backgrounds working together. Internship All High Tech High juniors are required to complete an internship in a local organization. The internship consists of an orientation followed by a four- week, full-time immersion at the work site, concluding with the intern‚Äôs presentation of learning. High Tech High seniors are required to intern for one semester on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Students receive credit for successfully completing their internship and related course work. The High Tech High Internship program aims to foster personal growth and help students acquire workplace skills in a real-world environment. The program offers local organizations a well-supported intern who provides a modest return on investment. Digital portfolios HTHNC students are required to develop a digital portfolio (DP) that provides a comprehensive look at their work, learning and projects. Students update their digital portfolios each semester, documenting their learning over time. In addition to student digital portfolios, teachers maintain their own DPs that have current assignments, project overviews and class exhibitions of projects. Intersession Intersession takes place once a year, with its purpose being to immerse students out in the community; whether locally, nationally, or internationally. Intersession programs can range from community service, to homework study, to leisurely trips to exotic destinations such as Costa Rica, New Zealand, or Brazil. Many of the programs within intersession are not limited to just a single grade or class; and the combination of students of different grades enables them to bond with other students, and teachers. Elective Since the High Tech High Organization does not require physical education to be taken by students, an elective is a program that is offered in substitution. Electives range from ultimate frisbee, to slack lining, to super support, to yoga or to robotics. Any student can put together their own, personalized elective, as long as they have a teacher to support them, and enough students to participate with them. Results Aside from High Tech High North County, there are several other schools that have been built that share the same values of the original HTH model: *New Bedford Global Learning Charter School, New Bedford, Massachusetts *New Urban High School, Clackamas, Oregon *Mirta Ramirez Computer Science Charter School, Chicago, Illinois *City High School, Tucson, Arizona *Explorer Elementary Charter School San Diego *High Tech High International San Diego *High Tech High Media Arts San Diego *High Tech Middle San Diego *High Tech Middle Media Arts San Diego *High Tech Los Angeles Los Angeles *High Tech High North County San Marcos, California See also *Education in the United States References External links * Education in San Marcos, California Charter high schools in California High Tech High charter schools ","title":"High Tech High North County"},{"id":"25144895","text":"Potterton is a hamlet north of Barwick-in-Elmet in City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

It is a designation used by Medicare/Medicaid in the US for determining MS-DRG reimbursement beginning with version 26 (October 1, 2008). Not only hospital-acquired infections but also any other situation or condition, such as pressure ulcers, blood type mismatch, or iatrogenic injury, can be a HAC. A patient at a hospital can be infected or otherwise degraded by hospital conditions and/or personnel in ways that are sometimes diagnosed as a \\"complication.\\" The US Medicare system designates some 1000+ ICD-9-CM diagnoses, out of over 14000 (as of 2009), as possible HACs. On February 8, 2006, the President signed the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. Section 5001(c) of DRA requires the Secretary to identify conditions that are: (a) high cost or high volume or both, (b) result in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis, and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Section 5001(c) provides that CMS can revise the list of conditions from time to time, as long as it contains at least two conditions. On July 31, 2008, in the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) fiscal year (FY) 2009 Final Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) selected 10 categories of conditions for a HAC payment provision. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, hospitals no longer receive additional payment for cases in which one of the selected conditions was not present on admission. That is, the case would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis were not present. Categories of hospital-acquired condition The following are the current, as of October 1, 2009 (MS-DRG v27), Hospital- Acquired Conditions: Conditions selected for implementation These conditions will have payment implications beginning on October 1, 2008. Object left in during surgery (998.4 CC) Air embolism (999.1 MCC) Blood incompatibility (999.6 CC) Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection, 996.64 CC & one of the following specific infection codes: 112.2, 590.10, 590.11, 590.2, 590.3, 590.80, 590.81, 590.9, 595.0, 595.3, 595.4, 595.81, 590.89, 595.9, 597.0, 597.80, 599.0 Pressure Ulcers (707.00-.01 & 7-7.09 CCs; 707.02-09 MCCs) Vascular Catheter Associated Infection (999.31 CC) Surgical Site Infection ‚Äì Mediastinitis after Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery (519.2 MCC & 36.10-.19) Falls and Trauma ‚Äì Fractures, Dislocations, Intracranial Injuries, Crushing Injuries, and Burns (Codes will be considered in FY2009 IPPS Proposed Rule) * Falls are a leading cause of hospital-acquired injury, and frequently prolong or complicate hospital stays. * Falls are the most common adverse event reported in hospitals. Almost all of the 1000+ diagnoses that are possible HACs are designated \\"Falls and trauma.\\"See the data. Determination When a diagnosis is recorded, it is designated either Present on Admission (POA) or not. If the diagnosis is POA, it is not demoted. However, if a diagnosis is not POA, it might be demoted. Most HAC diagnoses are demoted if they are not POA. Some that are not so simple are designated above with the tag \\"Proc,\\" \\"Diag,\\" or both. In those situations, a diagnosis must also be accompanied by one of a specific set of diagnoses, procedures, or both to be demoted. For instance, if a patient falls out of bed while in a hospital, the consequent broken hip was not present on admission, so the \\"complication\\" of \\"broken hip\\" would be demoted as a \\"Falls and trauma\\" HAC. The hospital would not be compensated for treatment of the injury. The intent of this sort of classification is to force hospitals to prevent such problems in the first place.

Their schoolteacher parents fostered the boys' early interest in music as they listened to traditional Baptist hymns, anthems and spirituals as well as blues music by Jimmy Reed, Junior Parker and B.B. King. They both sang in the church choir. Sherman studied clarinet and piano before taking up the bass, while Wendell learned trumpet, organ and guitar. Sherman studied composition and music theory at Virginia State University, but in 1959, he dropped out and headed to New York for a job playing with singer Jimmy Jones (of \\"Handy Man\\" fame). His younger brother Wendell joined him after completing high school. The two brothers played in a few bands before forming The Sevilles in 1963. The group lasted only three years, but they often backed up touring blues and soul acts such as artists like The Impressions, John Lee Hooker and Jerry Butler, gaining experience. After The Sevilles disbanded, Sherman, Wendell and a fellow Virginian, drummer Popsy Dixon, continued to play in a variety of Top 40 bar bands. Wendell also toured with Inez and Charlie Foxx (\\"Mockingbird\\") until 1979. Wendell Holmes, 2008 Sherman, Wendell, and Popsy convened in the form of a new group known as the Holmes Brothers in 1979. The three share vocals (some solo and some in gospel- inspired harmony), with Sherman playing bass, Wendell on guitar and piano, and Popsy on drums. The band frequently plays with additional musicians as well. The trio moved from their hometown of Christchurch, Virginia to Harlem where they regularly performed at blues clubs, most notably Dan Lynch's, a center of the local New York City blues scene. Here the Holmes Brothers formed working relationships with future blues/folk stars such as Joan Osborne and members of Blues Traveler. The group signed with Rounder Records in 1989 and released their first album In the Spirit the following year. Four subsequent albums would be recorded for the label. In 1992, the Holmes Brothers were signed to Peter Gabriel's Real World Records as the first American act on the prestigious world music label. In the mid 1990s the group performed with Van Morrison and recorded the soundtrack to the independent film Lotto Land, in which they also starred. In 1997, they were hired by Joan Osborne as her backing band for a tour supporting Bob Dylan. In 1998 the trio accompanied Freddie Roulette on his album, Spirit of Steel. In 2001, the Holmes Brothers signed with Alligator Records. Their first album for the label was the critically acclaimed Speaking in Tongues, produced by Joan Osborne. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune called it a \\"joyous, foot-stomping carnival‚Ä¶a gift to the world of music.\\"Kot, Greg. The Chicago Tribune, Review of Speaking In Tongues, March 9, 2001 The Chicago Sun-Times called it, \\"A Breathtaking and heartfelt journey through gospel-drenched soul, blues, funk and country.\\"Bessman, Jim. The Chicago Sun-Times, Review of Speaking In Tongues, March 30, 2001 The Holmes Brothers appeared on television on the Late Show with David Letterman and The CBS Saturday Early Show, as well as on NPR's Weekend Edition, A Prairie Home Companion and Mountain Stage. In addition, The Holmes Brothers appeared on the M.C. Records tribute to Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Shout, Sister, Shout, backing Joan Osborne, Odella, Victoria Williams and Phoebe Snow. Popsy Dixon at the Drum kit, 2008 In 2003 the group recorded two songs for the soundtrack album for the TV series Crossing Jordan. Also in 2003, Peter Gabriel released the single, \\"Burn You Up, Burn You Down,\\" featuring backing vocals by The Holmes Brothers. Sherman Holmes, bassist for the Holmes Brothers Following their next album for Alligator, Simple Truths, they appeared on Outlaws And Angels‚ÄîThe Willie Nelson and Friends 3rd Annual Birthday Concert (televised on USA Network and released on CD and DVD), Late Night with Conan O'Brien, World Cafe, Mountain Stage, as well as the nationally broadcast NPR programs All Things Considered, On Point, and Here And Now. The albums Simple Truths and State of Grace became the first two Holmes Brothers albums to reach the Billboard charts, with both reaching the top five of the Blues Albums chart. After the release of State of Grace, the band again performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Features and reviews ran in USA Today, The New York Times, Billboard, Time Out New York, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker and many other publications. State of Grace won the Blues Music Award for Soul Blues Album of the Year. Reviewer David Fricke of Rolling Stone called the album \\"impressive, fervent country soul.\\"Fricke, David. Rolling Stone, Album review of State of Grace, February 27, 2007 On March 2, 2010, the brothers released the album Feed My Soul, which was inspired in part by Wendell's bout with cancer. That album was followed by 2013's Brotherhood. The album was described in Living Blues magazine, which said, \\"Brotherhood is as soulful and alive as the Holmes Brothers performances and is a superior, award-worthy outing...sweet sounds from the beginning of American rock 'n' roll, African American southern gospel, and agonizingly beautiful, layered soul-baring harmonies, Jimmy Red blues lumps, string squeezing, moving bass lines, strong backbeats, NOLA second-line rhythms, street corner doo-wop and the twangy heartbreak of country. The rich interplay of all this music is what makes the Holmes Brothers a national treasure.\\" In 2014, The Holmes Brothers received an NEA National Heritage Fellowship, the highest honor bestowed upon traditional artists.

Bakshaish rugs are considered among the finest examples of larger rugs from the region. Taking their inspiration from Persian classical carpets, the abstract patterns of Bakshaish rugs and carpets feature bold, geometric designs. Most popularly Bakshaish rugs utilize curvilinear medallion designs, transforming classical cartoons into more abstract and energetic drawings similar to Caucasian tribal rugs. In the late 19th century the designs produced in Bakshaish carpets were akin to those of the Arak weavers. Often, following form of village pieces, Bakshaish carpets apply scattered graphics filling the woven field. Alternatively, they use empty space to allow graphics to stand out.

Fireworks.com Two commercially produced bang snaps, one of which has been used. Composition Bang snaps consist of a small amount of gravel or coarse sand impregnated with a minute quantity (~0.2 milligrams) of silver fulminate high explosive and twisted in a cigarette paper to produce a shape resembling a cherry. The friction-sensitive silver fulminate detonates when stepped on, ignited, or thrown on a hard surface, producing a sharp salute similar to a cap gun's. Despite producing a legitimate (albeit tiny) high-explosive detonation, the extremely high mass ratio of gravel to explosive acts as a buffer to ensure that they only produce the audible \\"crack\\" of the supersonic shockwave; they are incapable of producing physical damage, even when discharged in the hand.Katz, David A. \\"Chemistry in the Toy Store\\". 6th ed, 2002. Chymist.com The explosion is unable to propel the gravel any distance, which usually falls to the ground, making them safe for use as a children's toy, for which purpose they have been widely sold around the world since the 1950s. They are also a common part of Chinese New Year celebrations. Production Bang snaps are primarily produced alongside other export fireworks in Brazil, Korea and China and are widely available over the counter at small toy stores and shops specializing in jokes, novelties and magic tricks. The snaps are typically packed in sawdust to prevent them from discharging due to rough handling while in transit. Some US states and countries impose the same age restrictions on purchasing bang snaps as that of permitted fireworks, usually 17 or 18. In the UK they are advertised as fun snaps, and only sold to people 16 or above. In popular culture * In the 1985 film The Goonies, Data uses bang snaps as \\"booby traps\\" against the Fratelli family on their trail. * In Jackie Chan's film Police Story 2, bang snaps were thrown against Police Inspector Chan Ka- kui (played by Jackie Chan). * American musician Rickie Lee Jones used the box artwork from the \\"Pop Pop\\"-brand of bang snaps (made by Garrywa Fireworks of China) for the cover of her 1991 album of the same name. * In the 1999 comedy Big Daddy, Julian bonds with his biological father, Kevin, by throwing bang snaps (even at Kevin's feet). * In the South Park episode \\"Good Times with Weapons\\", Cartman annoys Kyle by constantly throwing bang snaps at his feet. * In the pilot of American Horror Story, a pair of twins use bang snaps to scare others.

They provide a clean, local water supply for domestic and farming use and are suited to semi-arid areas of the world. Operation A sand dam is a reinforced concrete wall (or a similarly robust and impermeable weir) built 1‚Äì5 metres high across a seasonal sand river. When it rains the dam captures soil laden water behind it ‚Äì the sand in the water sinks to the bottom, whilst the silt remains suspended in the water. Research on Kenyan dams shows that only 1 to 3% of rainwater is retained behind any individual dam, the remainder continues its natural flow towards the ocean.Hut et al 2008 Eventually the dams fill with sand - sometimes after only one rainfall or over 1 ‚Äì 3 seasons. 25 to 40% of the volume of the sand held is actually water. A mature sand dam can store millions of litres of water ‚Äì refilling after each rainfall providing a year round supply of clean water to over 1,000 people. File:sand dam illustration 2.jpg File:sand dam illustration 3.jpg File:Find a rock base.jpg File:Build a concrete wall.jpg File:Rain fills it.jpg File:Sand sinks.jpg  Application  The highest concentration of sand dams with the strongest track record is found in Kenya although examples are found throughout world‚Äôs semi-arid regions from Angola to Zimbabwe. Further examples are recorded in Japan, India, Thailand, SW USA and Brazil. 400px Sand dams can be built in the upper and middle courses of seasonal sandy river valleys (also known as wadis). Typically, sand dams are built in the transition zone between hills and plains where the gradient of the river bed is between 0.2 - 4%, but in extreme cases sand storage dams have been constructed on slopes of 10-16% (Nilsson 1988). Dams must be built on bed rock or highly compacted sub-soil. For the obvious reason of economy on materials and labour, the stream must be reasonably narrow with well defined and stable river banks and the bedrock or impermeable subsoil within a few metres of the stream bed. Rocky banks and gorges are the most apt features. Further advice on the siting, design and construction of sand dams is available from the organisations and in the manuals listed below  Extracting stored water  There are two simple ways: #Scooping a hole in the sand. The water will naturally emerge to the surface. Scope holes used for domestic water should be protected from contamination by livestock (by using acacia fencing or similar) #A slotted pipe buried in the sand that either passes through the dam wall or is connected to a simple hand pump situated on the river bank  Benefits  # Low cost and maintenance: Sand dams are the lowest cost form of rainwater harvesting known ‚Äì 3 to 100 times lower cost than other technologies. A sand dam is built to last over 50 years, has no operational costs and requires little maintenance. # Community owned and managed: Most examples of sand dams are built by members of the communities they serve with support local and international development agencies. Community ownership and management is key to their successful operation. # They save time and enable increased food production and tree planting: During drought periods in semi-arid regions, people might have to walk up to 12 hours a day to fetch water, which is often unsafe to drink. Freed from the chore of walking sometimes the whole day to collect the water, farmers are able to improve food production and generate surplus income. # They provide a clean, secure and local year-round water supply in water scarce environments: The sand effectively acts as a large slow sand filter resulting high quality potable water. As the water is held under the sand, evaporation is minimal, people are protected from water-borne diseases and mosquitoes can‚Äôt breed ‚Äì reducing the threat of malaria. # Wider benefits for health, education and communities: In areas where sand dams have been built, communities have observed a dramatic fall in water related disease, an increase in school attendance and a significant increase in household income and food production. # They transform the local ecology: The water held in the sand behind the dam spreads horizontally creating a permanent increase in the water table, allowing trees to grow naturally and transform the local ecology. The dams create a natural buffer that reduces the threat posed by flooding and drought and builds the resilience of communities to cope with the impacts of climate change in semi-arid regions.  Case Study: A socio-economic effort at Community Development in Kitui, Kenya  On a global scale climate change and effects there of have exerted tremendous pressure on the biophysical, economic, political and social systems that govern the sustenance of a majority of African populations. (Zierrogel et al, 2009) ‚ÄúClimate Change is expected to intensify existing problems and create new combinations of risks, particularly in Africa where there is widespread poverty and dependence on the natural environment.‚Äù (Zierrogel et al. 2009) Kitui is a region in Eastern Kenya, East Africa, where the sand dam project has been relatively more successful in comparison to other regions that adopted the same or similar systems. The Kitui region has approximately five hundred functional sand dams that help with water storage for subsistence and commercial purposes for example irrigation, domestic use and for feeding and sustaining livestock. (Maurits, 2008) Effectiveness of Sand Dams in Kitui With the setup of over 500 dams in the region there is no question to how these sand dams are a major community requirement. The image below shows an overview of the multiple uses of sand dams in the Kitui region. (Lasagne, 2008) Image: Table showing Sand Dams use in Kitui (Lasagne, 2008) Image 2.0: Table showing Sand Dams use in Kitui (Lasagne, 2008) Human welfare:- these dams provide water security during the dry season when numerous rivers and wells dry up due to the harsh conditions of the region. (Lasagne, 2008) Quality of nature:- The dams provide water to the ecosystem by feeding the water table hence trees and flora are able to thrive in the surrounding areas. (Lasagne, 2008) Food capacity:- Due to access to water reserves numerous individuals engage in subsistence and semi-commercial farming which creates a source of income and livelihood for the Kitui People. (Lasagne, 2008) Industrial use:- On a larger scale these dams provide water for industrial capacity as individuals are able to engage on economic activities such as charcoal production, basket making and brick laying which creates a semi-stable source of income for the locals. (Lasagne, 2008) Hindrances to the sand dam project There are numerous obstacles to the sand dam projects but the major ones that stand out are irregularity of the rainy seasons, slow funding, lack of communal platforms to run the projects and maintain them. (Lasagne, 2008) Conclusion ‚ÄúThe average income of farmers using sand dams rose with 9000 KSh. (USD 120), while less than 3% of total runoff is used. It is estimated that in 10 years time, more than 100,000 people have better access to water through low cost measure at an investment of about 35 USD per capita.‚Äù (Lasagne, 2008) If these projects had more government, Non-governmental participation and an increased community involvement, Kitui could be a world renown model for the ability of rural communities to combat drought , famine and other effects of climate change.

He was also co-writer of the group's hits like \\"Western Union\\" and \\"I See The Light\\". Early life Rabon was born in Port Arthur, Texas, in April 1943 but moved to southeastern Oklahoma in the first year of his life. His father and mother, both Oklahoma natives, taught school in a tiny community in Oklahoma called Spencerville with a population of about 300. It was there that Rabon taught himself to play guitar. By 12 he had joined a local group called The Buckaroos. After high school he joined the Army Reserve for a 6 months stint in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. After the Army he enrolled in college at Southeastern State University in Durant, Oklahoma. The Five Americans In college, he formed the beginnings of The Five Americans. The band was originally named The Muntineers but was later changed to The Five Americans to combat the rock and roll British influx in the mid-1960s. The group became successful charting 5 records: \\"I See The Light\\", \\"Evol Not Love\\", \\"Sound of Love\\", \\"ZipCode\\", and \\"Western Union\\", the last covered by The Ventures, The Strangers (Australia), and The Searchers (England), and also used in the film Vanilla Sky starring Tom Cruise. Mike Rabon had a successful touring career afterwards, released two albums that sold well, and played guitar for the Tyler, Texas, pop group, Gladstone, whose \\"A Piece of Paper\\" reached No. 45 in October 1972. Rabon later formed a group called Michael Rabon and Choctaw which also included former Five Americans drummer Jimmy Wright. One album was released by Uni in the early 1970s to good reviews but was mostly overlooked by the label due to promotional and legal difficulties. After 10 years in the music business, Rabon went back to college and obtained his master's degree in administration.

It is a wooden house built in the 1830s, overlooking the Hudson River, for Carman, operator of a local shipyard and inventor of a moveable centerboard. Its architecture exemplifies a late vernacular application of the Federal style common in western Dutchess County at that time, showing the transition to the Greek Revival mode and both Dutch and English influences. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently vacant and undergoing some repairs. Building The house is situated on a wooded 10-acre (4 ha) lot along River Road South on the south side of Chelsea. It is above the level of the road, which itself is elevated above the river and the tracks of the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line to its immediate west. Trees screen the house from the road. Access to the house is provided by an unpaved driveway which begins to the north and parallels the road. There is a garage on the property that is of more modern construction and thus not considered a contributing resource to the National Register listing. Its one-and-a-half-story rectangular five-bay clapboard- sided gable-roofed main block sits on a raised stone foundation. The roofline is marked by a plain frieze and articulated cornice. Pairs of brick chimneys rise on the north and south. There are wings on all four sides. On the front (west) facade is the three-bay projecting entrance portico, with a pediment originally supported by four Doric columns (now temporarily replaced by wooden beams). On the rear is a one-story shed-roofed addition. On the north and south are two flat-roofed one-story wings, added later. The south wing was a library; the north one probably an office. It has a small porch. A freestanding third wing, one and a half stories with a gabled roof on a brick basement, was also later attached near the north end of the shed-roofed addition. The connecting passageway between it and the house was itself later adapted into a garage. The main entrance, framed by stylized pilasters, leads to a central hall that goes all the way to the back of the shed-roofed addition. The interior has been stripped for repair work, but original pieces included a mahogany balustrade on the main stairway and a black marble mantelpiece. History Carman acquired the land in 1833 from the Ashburys, local farmers who had subdivided, probably to take advantage of a growing local economy. It is not known what Carman did before 1820, or if he came from somewhere other than Chelsea, but after that year he had operated a shipyard where the Chelsea Yacht Club's clubhouse now stands. He may have been leasing the Ashburys' property for some time before 1833. At first he built wooden sloops, the most common ship along the river in those days. In their 1908 history The Sloops of the Hudson, William Verplanck and Moses Collyer (whose own house, Driftwood, is nearby) credit him with the invention of a moveable centerboard that allowed sloops more stable maneuvering in the deeper sections of the river without having to sacrifice their ability to put ashore at shallow ports. The one Carman installed on his boat the Freedom is believed to have been the first. It became a standard feature shortly thereafter. He also changed with the times. When steam-powered vessels began to be used following Robert Fulton's voyage up the river on the Clermont in the 1820s, he began building them. One, the Plow-Boy, was the first steam ferry used on the Newburgh-Fishkill Landing route in 1828. The home he built in 1835 shows an awareness of the vernacular building traditions of the area. It is basically Georgian in form and Federal in plan, styles associated with Americans of English descent, but maintains the one-and-a-half-story scale of Dutch houses common in the region. There are some influences of New England traditions, particularly the Greek Revival detailing, typical of houses in that style built in similar settings by merchants and other successful men of the era. The decor is more restrained than on those found in New England. Also relating to that region is the shed-roofed rear addition, not seen on most Hudson Valley homes. The property originally stretched down to the riverfront, where Carman had his wharves. In the mid-19th century the coming of the Hudson River Railroad, which would eventually displace most river shipping, cut the land in two, although Carman retained access across the tracks. It remained a private residence in active use until sometime after 1983. At some point between then and the beginning of the 21st century the property fell into its present disused, overgrown state.

In the summer of 1936, RGM Timi»ôoara merged with CA Timi»ôoara (which ceased to exist) to form the new team named CAM Timi»ôoara, it played one Romanian Cup final in 1938.The club was dissolved in 1949. History The club was founded in 1911, under the name Reuniunea de gimnasticƒÉ a muncitorilor din Timi»ôoara (Workers Gimnastic Reunion from Timi»ôoara), when it started officially in the district championship. Colours: red-black. The first president of the association was Sigismund L√∂bi. The usual team used during the period before World War I was: Holzer ‚Äì Reuter I, Drexeler, Reuter II, T√≥th, Horv√°th ‚Äì Heich, R. Wetzer, Stepumer, Serly, Blum. After the war, the club activated in the Timi»ôoara District Championship, 1st Category, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table. Players used during the 1925‚Äì1929 period were: P√ºl√∂ck, Grell, Zarda II, Koch, Steinbach, Radici, Wessely, Ranschau, Katai, Szlovik, Busza, Karlach, Sindelar, Szedlanik, L√∂wenfeld, Kov√°cs, Antalescu, Palmer II, Loch, Stepan, Szab√≥, Sz√ºcs. In the summer of 1936, CA Timi»ôoara disappeared after a merger with RGM Timi»ôoara, to form the new team named CAM Timi»ôoara. At the end of the 1929‚Äì30 season of the Regional Championship, the club finishes 1st and qualifies for the final tournament of the national championship, Divizia A 1929‚Äì30. It reaches the quarter-finals being eliminated by Gloria CFR Arad, 1‚Äì0. In 1932‚Äì33, at the start of the newly formed Divizia A, RGM Timi»ôoara becomes Timi»ôoara's one of two representatives at this competitional level, alongside Ripensia Timi»ôoara. It finishes 6th in the Seria II of the Divizia A 1932‚Äì33 and is obliged to participate at a play-off to avoid relegation. It plays against Rom√¢nia Cluj and Juventus Bucharest and loses both matches. So it relegates to the District Championship. The team used in the Divizia A 1932‚Äì33: Fuch ‚Äì Moln√°r, Hajdu ‚Äì Gerber, Stepan, M√°th√© ‚Äì Iovicin, Reuter, L√∂wenfeld, Stocksl√§ger, Busza. After one season in the Timi»ôoara District Championship (1933‚Äì34), the club enters the first edition of the Divizia B and finishes the 1934‚Äì35 season 3rd in the Seria II. The next season RGM finishes 4th. Team used: Gervin ‚Äì Gerber, Hajdu ‚Äì Pokomy, Weidle, Morawetz ‚Äì Seceni, T√≥th, Stepan, J√°nosi, Reuter. In August 1936, RGM Timi»ôoara merges with CA Timi»ôoara and becomes CAM Timi»ôoara (Workers Athletic Club from Timi»ôoara). At the end of the 1937‚Äì38 season of the Divizia B the team finishes 2nd, behind UD Re≈üi≈£a. This was a good season for the club, as it was the first one that reached a Romanian Cup final while playing in Divizia B, which was lost with 2‚Äì3 against Rapid Bucharest. At the end of the 1938‚Äì39 season of the Divizia B, the club finishes 1st in the Seria III. By doing this, they won the right to participate at a play-off for the promotion to the Divizia A. Their opponent was Mure≈üul T√¢rgu Mure≈ü. They succeeded to promote after (4‚Äì1, 0‚Äì1) with the following players: Eichler, Gerber, Kohn, Farag√≥, Szepe, J√°nosi, B√ºcher, Zsizsik, Possak, Szeles II, Sz√∂cs, Reuter, Golgo»õiu, Ilie»ô, T√≥th, Cota, Ciobanu, Persam. CAM finishes 5th the Divizia A 1939‚Äì40, having in its squad Ripensia's international player Silviu Bindea. The following season, CAM is excluded from the Divizia A and consequently plays in the Divizia B, Seria I, where it finishes 10th (last). After World War II, the club merges for a brief period with Chinezul Timi»ôoara, the new club being named Chinezul CAM Timi»ôoara, but only until 1946 when it comes back to the CAM name. It plays in the Divizia B, finishing 9th and 2nd at the end of the 1946‚Äì47 and 1947‚Äì48 seasons.

Distributed by King Features Syndicate, it began in 2002.Dean Mullaney, Bruce Canwell and Brian Walker, King of the Comics : One Hundred Years of King Features Syndicate. San Diego : IDW Publishing, 2015. (pp.276,303) The comic strip ended its run on July 2, 2017. Characters and story \\"Tina‚Äôs Groove chronicled the personal and workplace adventures of a single, smart, attractive waitress who worked at Pepper‚Äôs restaurant. Shrewdly self-aware, Tina refuted clich√©d notions of single women as neurotics obsessed with career or marriage. Tina found her groove and empowered herself by embracing life and everyone she met head-on.\\"Tina's Groove: About * Tina works as a waitress at Pepper's Restaurant and is \\"happy being Tina\\", living life rather than waiting for it to begin. She is described as \\"smart, funny and real\\", an everywoman in her 30s who \\"struggles to deal with her job, dating and the ups and downs of day-to-day living\\". * Gus, Tina's boyfriend, whom she met at a speed dating event in 2012. * Suzanne, Tina's best friend and fellow waitress is \\"always looking for a good time\\" and enjoys casual relationships with a large number of men. * Monica, the hostess at Pepper's, is spacey and oblivious. Maybe she sees things others don't, or maybe she's just crazy. She is hopelessly in love with Rob, although the feeling is not mutual. * Carlos the chef is known for his ego and his outdated views on gender and romance. * Rob the general manager is shy and reserved, but a bit of a control freak. * Other recurring characters include Claud the taxi driver, Tina's mother, Jake the bartender, and various unnamed customers. Piccolo offered her description of the characters on July 4, 2012: :Tina‚Äôs imperfections, if she has any, are of the kind that are quirky, and therefore endearing. This is good for a cartoon character. I believe the main character of a comic strip should be one that‚Äôs likable. But does that mean the main character should be flawless? It‚Äôs the weaknesses, or fixations, that make characters interesting. The other characters of the strip all have fixations that make them imperfect. Rob, the manager of Pepper‚Äôs Restaurant, is a misfit neat/control freak who hasn‚Äôt yet realized that it‚Äôs now cool to be a geek. Carlos is a sack of testosterone who must prove himself to be the manliest at any cost. Suzanne is a spoiled 30 something flake who has so many weaknesses she‚Äôs created a personality out of being less than perfect. And then there‚Äôs Monica. If you read the strip then I don‚Äôt have to waste my words on Monica. Tina stands apart. One good reason for this is that Tina is what‚Äôs known in the comedy world as the ‚ÄúStraight Man‚Äù. She‚Äôs the only sane character in a world of insanity. In the strip she represents logic, the voice of reason, while every one else is crazy. This is where most of the humor comes from. Readers have wondered if Tina is depressed or deeply worried about something, but Piccolo explains that this impression is mistaken and may be an inadvertent effect of Tina's hairstyle, specifically the hair bangs being drawn \\"at the same angle that you‚Äôd use to draw a 'worried eyebrow' expression\\". :\\"Tina‚Äôs not depressed ‚Äî no more than any other person. When I started the strip I didn‚Äôt know a lot about her, but I did know what I didn‚Äôt want her to be. I didn‚Äôt want my main character to be sappy and sickeningly sweet. I wanted to write her as a girl who had real-world traits who just happened to be nice in a normal, non-mushy way... The thing is, I don‚Äôt want Tina to be smiling in every situation ‚Äî that would be sappy.\\" The strip ran in such newspapers as the Cincinnati Enquirer, the Arizona Republic and the Toronto Star, and it is also available through King Features' DailyINK email service.Tina's Groove Books Comparisons with this Tina's Groove from 2006 show how the art style and characters evolved. In 2006, Andrews & McMeel published Tina‚Äôs Groove: A Cartoon Collection (), collecting selected strips from its first few years.

The fire at a whisky bond killed 14 fire service and 5 salvage corps personnel. This fire was overshadowed only by a similar fire in James Watt Street (also in Glasgow) on 19 November 1968, when 22 people died. Fire On the evening of 28 March 1960, a fire started in a bonded warehouse owned by Arbuckle, Smith and Company in Cheapside Street, Anderston, Glasgow. The Glasgow Fire Service was initially alerted by a 999 call at 7:15 pm from the foreman of the Eldorado Ice Cream Company, which was near the whisky bond. He reported smoke coming from a second floor window of the warehouse. In response, two pumps from West Station with Sub Officer James Calder in charge were sent, along with a turntable ladder from Central Station. Also responding initially was the fire boat St Mungo and a salvage tender and crew from the Glasgow Salvage Corps. The first fire crews arrived at 7:21 pm: after a quick reconnaissance, three more pumps were requested to attend. Crews were informed by civilians that smoke and flame had been seen on the Warroch Street side of the building and additional crews and equipment were sent to investigate. Assistant Firemaster Swanson had now arrived on the scene and having been fully apprised of the situation increased the number of pumps (fire engines) to eight. This message was sent at 7:49 pm. Seconds after it was transmitted, an explosion occurred. The warehouse contained over a million gallons of whisky held in 21,000 wooden casks, and 30,000 gallons of rum. As the temperature of the fire increased, some of these casks ruptured, causing a massive boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) that burst the front and rear walls of the building outwards causing large quantities of masonry to collapse into the street. This collapse instantly killed three firemen in Cheapside Street as well as 11 firemen and five salvagemen who were battling the blaze from the rear of the building in Warroch Street. By 8:12 pm, Firemaster Chadwick assumed command and upgraded the incident to twenty pumps. At its peak, thirty pumps, five turntable ladders and various special vehicles attended. In all, 450 firefighters from the Greater Glasgow area were involved in fighting the fire, which took a week to extinguish. Witnesses reported seeing bright blue flames leaping 40 feet (12 metres) into the sky, with the glow visible across the entire city. Neighbouring buildings, including a tobacco warehouse, an ice cream factory and the Harland and Wolff engine works, were engulfed. The recovery of the bodies in Warroch Street was not completed until 10.20 am on 31 March. The incident remains Britain's worst peacetime fire services disaster.

A memorial service is held on 28 March each year, with representatives of the fire service and Glasgow City Council present. Memorial services and other observations were held in 2010 to mark the 50th anniversary of the disaster. Due to the ban on mass gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 60th anniversary commemoration was a more limited affair, signified by a wreath-laying by Chief Officer Martin Blunden alone. The reverse side of the monument remembers those firefighters lost in the Kilbirnie Street fire in 1972.

It makes itself hard to remove by installing many different copies with different names in different locations. The running copy is a system process and will restart if it is closed manually. It adds itself to auto run information so that it executes multiple copies on startup. The copies monitor each other and will restore each other if one is deleted. This makes deleting from Windows nearly impossible. Known file names used by the virus are Fun.exe, DC.exe, Other.exe, SVIQ.exe, win.exe, and WinSit.exe .

However the graphic icon for the folder is poorly ripped from windows service icons and can be distinguished by subtle visual differences, predominantly white below the black outline of the folder which on the real folder icon is dithered to transparent space. This visual difference is especially noticeable in safe mode when graphic operating capacity is in 256 color mode instead of 24 bit color mode.

Study of these has been prompted by the prospect they might be generated by the increased stress leading up to an earthquake, and might thereby provide a basis for short-term earthquake prediction. However, despite many studies, no form of seismo-electromagnetics has been shown to be effective for earthquake prediction. A key problem is that earthquakes themselves produce relatively weak electromagnetic phenomena, and the effects from any precursory phenomena are likely to be too weak to measure. Close monitoring of the Parkfield earthquake revealed no significant pre-seismic electromagnetic effects. However, some researchers remain optimistic, and searches for seismo- electromagnetic earthquake precursors continue. VAN method The VAN method ‚Äì named after P. Varotsos, K. Alexopoulos and K. Nomicos, authors of the 1981 papers describing it ‚Äì measures low frequency electric signals, termed \\"seismic electric signals\\" (SES), by which Varotsos and several colleagues claimed to have successfully predicted earthquakes in Greece. (preface to a special edition about VAN) Both the method itself and the manner by which successful predictions were claimed have been severely criticized and debated by VAN, but the critics have not retracted their views. (proceedings of a conference that reviewed VAN)twenty articles in a special issue of Geophysical Research Letters (table of contents) Since 2001, the VAN group has introduced a concept they call \\"natural time\\", applied to the analysis of their precursors. Initially it is applied on SES to distinguish them from noise and relate them to a possible impending earthquake. In case of verification (classification as \\"SES activity\\"), natural time analysis is additionally applied to the general subsequent seismicity of the area associated with the SES activity, in order to improve the time parameter of the prediction. The method treats earthquake onset as a critical phenomenon.; ... After 2006, VAN say that all alarms related to SES activity have been made public by posting at arxiv.org. One such report was posted on Feb. 1, 2008, two weeks before the largest earthquake in Greece during the period 1983‚Äì2011. This earthquake occurred on February 14, 2008, with magnitude () 6.9. VAN's report was also described in an article in the newspaper Ethnos on Feb. 10, 2008.. However, Gerassimos Papadopolous complained that the VAN reports were confusing and ambiguous, and that \\"none of the claims for successful VAN predictions is justified.\\" QuakeFinder and 'Freund physics' In his investigations of crystalline physics, Friedemann Freund found that water molecules embedded in rock can dissociate into ions if the rock is under intense stress. The resulting charge carriers can generate battery currents under certain conditions. Freund suggested that perhaps these currents could be responsible for earthquake precursors such as electromagnetic radiation, earthquake lights and disturbances of the plasma in the ionosphere. The study of such currents and interactions is known as \\"Freund physics\\". Most seismologists reject Freund's suggestion that stress-generated signals can be detected and put to use as precursors, for a number of reasons. First, it is believed that stress does not accumulate rapidly before a major earthquake, and thus there is no reason to expect large currents to be rapidly generated. Secondly, seismologists have extensively searched for statistically reliable electrical precursors, using sophisticated instrumentation, and have not identified any such precursors. And thirdly, water in the earth's crust would cause any generated currents to be absorbed before reaching the surface. QuakeFinder is a company focused on developing a system for earthquake prediction. The company has a long-standing collaboration with Freund. They have deployed a network of sensor stations that detect the electromagnetic pulses the team believes precede major earthquakes. Each sensor is believed to have a range of approximately 10 miles (16 km) from the instrument to the source of the pulses. As of 2016, the company says they have 125 stations in California, and their affiliate Jorge Heraud says he has 10 sites in Peru. Using these sensors, Heraud says that he has been able to triangulate pulses seen from multiple sites, in order to determine the origin of the pulses. He said that the pulses are seen beginning from 11 to 18 days before an impending earthquake, and have been used to determine the location and timing of future seismic events. However, insofar as a verifiable prediction would require a publicly-stated announcement of the location, time, and size of an impending event before its occurrence, neither Quakefinder nor Heraud have yet verifiably predicted an earthquake, much less issued multiple predictions of the type that might be objectively testable for statistical significance.  Corralitos anomaly  In the month prior to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake measurements of the earth's magnetic field at ultra-low frequencies by a magnetometer in Corralitos, California, just 7 km from the epicenter of the impending earthquake, started showing anomalous increases in amplitude. Just three hours before the quake the measurements soared to about thirty times greater than normal, with amplitudes tapering off after the quake. Such amplitudes had not been seen in two years of operation, nor in a similar instrument located 54 km away. To many people such apparent locality in time and space suggested an association with the earthquake. called it \\"encouraging\\". Additional magnetometers were subsequently deployed across northern and southern California, but after ten years, and several large earthquakes, similar signals have not been observed. More recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction. Study of the closely monitored 2004 Parkfield earthquake found no evidence of precusory electromagnetic signals of any type.. See also (no VAN- type SES observed) and (\\"no effects found that can be reasonably characterized as precursors\\"). ULF magnetic field precursors Two recent studies by Konstantinos Eftaxias and his colleagues examined ULF magnetic fields preceding major earthquakes. At the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, ULF radiation exhibited critical behavior, while at the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, the researchers found a depression of the horizontal ULF magnetic field, which may also be interpreted as a manifestation of criticality.For supporting information and review, see also and TEC variations Professor Kosuke Heki of Hokkaido University in Japan said that he discovered by accident that GPS signals changed about 40 minutes before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Reviewing historical data for other earthquakes, he found that this same correlation occurred during other incidents. He suggested that the GPS signals were detecting variations in the levels of the TEC (total electron content) of the ionosphere in the hour preceding an earthquake.Kosuke Heki, Ionospheric electron enhancement preceding the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake, Geophysical Research Letters, V. 38, L17312, 5 PP., 2011 doi:10.1029/2011GL047908 abstractBBC News Satellite observations The \\"Detection of Electro-Magnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions\\" satellite, constructed by CNES, has made observations which show strong correlations between certain types of low frequency electromagnetic activity and the most seismically active zones on the Earth, and have shown a sharp signal in the ionospheric electron density and temperature near southern Japan seven days before a 7.1 magnitude earthquake occurred there (on August 29 and September 5, 2004, respectively). Quakesat is an earth observation nanosatellite based on 3 CubeSats. It was designed to be a proof-of-concept for collecting extremely low frequency earthquake precursor signals from space. The primary instrument is a magnetometer housed in a 2-foot (0.6 m) telescoping boom. The science behind the concept is disputed. ESPERIA is an equatorial space mission mainly concerned with detecting any tectonic and preseismic related signals. More in general, it has been proposed for defining the near-Earth electromagnetic, plasma, and particle environment, and for studying perturbations and instabilities in the ionosphere-magnetosphere transition region. To study earthquake preparation processes and anthropogenic impacts in the Earth's surface, a phase A study has been realized for the Italian Space Agency. The Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) radar satellite, which was canceled in the White House's 2012 budget proposal, would have the capacity to identify elastic strain in tectonic plates, combining L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar and a multi-beam infrared lidar to detect strains in the Earth's surface that could lead to serious earthquakes.Simons, Mark, \\"Budget Cuts and the Next Earthquake\\", Wall Street Journal, March 23, 2011Morring Jr., Frank, \\"Funding Uncertainty Shaping NASA Programs\\", Aviation Week, Mar 28, 2011 Russia and the United Kingdom agreed to jointly deploy two satellites in 2015 that will measure electromagnetic signals that are released from the earth's crust prior to earthquakes. The project is said to be able to \\"help predict earthquakes and potentially save thousands of lives.\\" \\"Russian, British scientists eye satellites to predict earthquakes\\", AHN, February 22, 2011 Another site of current research is China, where a satellite launch was planned for 2014, to provide data from ionospheric phenomena for comparison with seismo-electromagnetic phenomena on the ground. Such a link is partially borne out in the current literature, with ionospheric phenomena already shown to precede seismic phenomena by a few hours to days. The network would potentially show whether such ionospheric phenomena are sourced from ground electrical phenomena.

The game centers around Jake Dunbar, the sole survivor of a plane crash on a mysterious tropical island inhabited by zombies under control of a mad scientist. The game was made to have the feel of horror pulp comics. A minicomic was included with the game on release. Reception to the game was negative, both on release and in retrospectives. Criticism was given to its graphics, in-game map, and its structure. Publications such as Computer Gaming World have called it one of the worst video games of all time. Gameplay and plot Gameplay of Isle of the Dead, with the main character holding a machete. Isle of the Dead is a first-person shooter and point-and-click adventure game. The plot follows the player character, Jake Dunbar, who is the lone survivor of a plane wreck on a mysterious tropical island filled with zombies under the control of a mad scientist. The goal of the game is to escape the island and save the damsel in distress. After retrieving items from the wreckage, Dunbar explores the beach and moves further inland by hacking at the undergrowth with a machete. Dunbar can also acquire guns, although ammunition is scarce and limited. Instant-death traps also appear in the game ‚Äì in one of these, a gun blows up in Dunbar's face if it is not lubricated. Quitting the game causes Dunbar to commit suicide by shooting himself in the head. Development and release Isle of the Dead was developed by Rainmaker Software and published by Dallas, Texas-based company Merit Software. The game's concept and design was created by A. Sean Glaspell; it was programmed by Bruce J. Mack and Bryan Kelsch, and featured art by Myk Friedman. The game was originally intended to be a hack-and-slash game. Programmer Bryan Kelsch, however, disliked games giving players tasks without reasons to do them. Because of this, the programming teams added a script with narrative hooks, attempting to turn the game into a \\"good hack and slash game, but with a strong plot\\". Kelsch said the game was intended to have the feel of horror pulp comics, so a minicomic was included with the game. Isle of the Dead was later shown at the 1993 Consumer Electronics Show. A port for the Atari Jaguar CD was in development but never released. The game was released 1993.  Reception  Previewing the game at the Consumer Electronics Show, Computer Gaming World, while not impressed with that game graphically, thought that it made up for this with its \\"enthusiasm, gore, and the spicy addition of a little gratuitous T&A;\\". Upon its initial release, Isle of the Dead received negative reviews, and it was compared to Wolfenstein 3D. Sandy Petersen, writing for Dragon in their \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column, gave the game zero out of five stars in the magazine's rating scale, advising readers to avoid playing it. Peter Olafson, of Compute!, while negative towards the graphics, compared the mood of Isle of the Dead to EC Comics horror magazines. Chris Lombardi, writing for Computer Gaming World, argued the game was designed to be campy, but otherwise described it as the worst video game he had seen among adventure games and games with 3D graphics. In their 15th anniversary issue, Computer Gaming World rated Isle of the Dead the 32nd worst game of all time, noting its \\"crude graphics, weak sound, and a weak 3D engine\\". Electronic Games, on the other hand, gave a positive review, saying that the game was not intend to be taken seriously. Retrospective reviews for Isle of the Dead were also negative. Kurt Kalata from Hardcore Gaming 101 said that Rainmaker Software took the worst elements of point-and-click adventures and first- person shooters and turned them into \\"an overtly shlocky mess\\", criticizing the lack of feedback when taking damage and the death animations throughout the game. PC Gamers Richard Cobbett, in his \\"Saturday Crapshoot\\" column, criticized its structure and the in-game map for being unhelpful. Corbett would later call it one of the weirdest shooters of the 1990s. Adam Smith, of Rock, Paper, Shotgun, called Isle of the Dead one of the worst games he had ever played.

Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez wrote, produced and scored the film, as well as starring as its protagonist, Barlam. Despite Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez completing two prior feature- length films, The Sentimental Engine Slayer is the first to screen publicly and will likely be the first available as a commercial release. Filmed entirely on location in El Paso, Texas in September/October 2007, the film features contributions from a number of persons associated with The Mars Volta, notably John Frusciante (ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers and honorary TMV guitarist; executive producer), Juan Alderete (TMV bassist; line producer); Paul Hinojos (former TMV guitarist; line producer); Sara Christina Gross (contributing saxophonist on various TMV and ORL releases; associate producer, co-production designer); Sonny Kay (Rodriguez Lopez Productions art director; co-production designer and title card design); and Lars Stalfors (live and studio engineer; sound recordist). A labor of love made possible with the favors of friends and family, The Sentimental Engine Slayer features appearances by and/or contributions of Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez's parents and siblings, childhood friends, and a skeleton crew of industry professionals. The film premiered at the 2010 International Film Festival Rotterdam. Plot The Sentimental Engine Slayer tells the compelling, confounding tale of the overdue coming of age of a twenty-something misfit named Barlam. Barlam's awkward transition from boy to man is as much the story of struggling to find one's essence in a world of stereotypes as it is an indictment of the distorted reality of family life in the disengaged 21st century. A bottom-rung grocery bagger whose neo-incestuous relationship with his addict sister, Natalia, causes him no small amount of grief and disillusionment, Barlam seeks solace in the convoluted wisdom of what few male peers are available, namely his androgynous, alcoholic boss, Oscar, and the sister's simple-minded boyfriend, Zack. Seeking an explanation as to the strange circumstances of his apparent lack of family structure, as well as the respect from others fundamentally absent in his mundane model-building existence, Barlam is soon led astray amid a seedy underworld of prostitutes, hustlers and addicts. The labyrinthine plot soon begs questioning as to where reality ends and fantasy begins, Barlam shifting effortlessly between hapless punching bag, assertive surrogate father figure, and rage-prone psychopath.The Sentimental Engine Slayer References External links Sentimental Engine Slayer on Rotterdam Filmfestival 2010 films 2010 drama films Culture of El Paso, Texas 2010 directorial debut films American drama films ","title":"The Sentimental Engine Slayer"},{"id":"25145939","text":"Belkaya Dam is a dam in Burdur Province, Turkey.

Saffron Burrows portrayed the character in the first season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Rachele Schank portrayed her younger self in the seventh season. Publication history Victoria Hand was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Mike Deodato. Her first appearance was in The Invincible Iron Man #8 by the creative team of Matt Fraction and Salvador Larroca, although her subsequent appearance in Dark Avengers #1, by Bendis and Deodato, predates this in continuity. Hand appeared as a supporting character throughout the 2010-2013 New Avengers series from issue #1 (August 2010) through the character's death in issue #32 (December 2012). Fictional character biography Hand was initially introduced as a S.H.I.E.L.D. accountant, dating a fellow agent named Isabelle - a partner with different beliefs about the fight against criminals and terrorists. Three years before the Secret Invasion storyline, Victoria sent a letter to S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury about his war on terrorism and her concerns that he was doing a poor job. Isabelle implored Victoria not to send the letter. The result was Hand's transferral to a S.H.I.E.L.D. Base in Portland, Oregon. Hand's relationship broke down due to Isabelle's anger over her advice being ignored.Dark Avengers #11. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline, Norman Osborn was promoted from director of Thunderbolt Initiative to the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. upon which he dismantled it and transformed it into the operation known as H.A.M.M.E.R. He appointed Victoria to the position of Deputy Director of this organization due to her vocal opposition of previous S.H.I.E.L.D. directors Nick Fury and Tony Stark. She willingly supported Osborn's agenda to subvert the heroes and place villains instead, believing that Osborn would bring peace to the world. Victoria also has a certain level of authority over Norman's Avengers despite the fact Norman gave Moonstone the position of his second-in- command.Mighty Avengers #20. Marvel Comics. She was also given the task of finding an acronym for H.A.M.M.E.R.Invincible Iron Man #8. Marvel Comics. Norman Osborn received word from Victoria Hand that they have apprehended Maria Hill.Invincible Iron Man #11. Marvel Comics. Victoria was sent with Moonstone to neutralize Bruce Banner (AKA the Hulk), Osborn reasoning that Banner's intellect is a greater threat than the Hulk's brute strength. She and Moonstone engaged a powerless Bruce Banner and Skaar. H.A.M.M.E.R. gave the duo the means to restore Banner's gamma powers, something Skaar was waiting for (as he had sworn to kill his true \\"father\\"). With Banner coated in gamma radiation the duo left, their mission accomplished.Dark Reign-The List: Hulk one-shot. Marvel Comics. Victoria was part of the attack that went after the Asgardians, where she was leading the helicarrier squad.Siege #4. Marvel Comics. During the attack, the ship she was on was heavily damaged and Victoria ordered the evacuation of the crew. When the Void took full control of Robert Reynolds' body, Iron Man informed her to leave the ship as he intended to use the Helicarrier as a giant bullet. After the battle, Victoria didn't resist arrest and was taken on to a Helicarrier, where she was interviewed by Captain Steve Rogers. Victoria said that she didn't regret anything and that she was trying to help the world. In response, Steve gave her a position in his new team, which surprised Victoria.Dark Avengers #16. Marvel Comics. It was later revealed that she had been assigned by Captain Steve Rogers to be the liaison for Luke Cage's team of Avengers, dubbed the New Avengers, because Rogers feels that she can provide an important insight to the team.New Avengers vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics. Spider-Man in particular does not trust her due to her old contact with Osborn, to the extent that he refuses to reveal his secret identity to her even when it means that he will not get paid for his work on the team.New Avengers vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics. Luke's wife Jessica Jones also does not trust Hand, mainly because Hand nervously pointed a cannon at her and their infant daughter when they met in the Avengers mansion. Hand was contacted by the remnants of H.A.M.M.E.R. to ask her to join them; instead, she provided the meeting location to the New Avengers so that they could sabotage the meeting. The subsequent assault resulted in the potentially fatal injury of Mockingbird.New Avengers vol. 2 #11. Marvel Comics. During a later confrontation with Superia (head of this branch of H.A.M.M.E.R.), Hand claimed that her betrayal of H.A.M.M.E.R. was actually a ruse intended to convince Steve Rogers that her allegiance is with him after H.A.M.M.E.R. contacted her on a public line rather than through more secret channels.New Avengers vol. 2 #12. Marvel Comics. She then provided the New Avengers with the location from which the H.A.M.M.E.R. agents were going to be recovered, allowing the Avengers to capture Superia and use an experimental serum she was trying to steal to treat Mockingbird.New Avengers vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics. Spider-Man's suspicions of Hand eventually prompted him to leave the New Avengers (although this was due in part to his new responsibilities in the Future Foundation), informing the rest of the team that she would eventually turn on them due to her old ties to Norman Osborn. Spider-Man eventually returned to the team.New Avengers vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics. After Osborn's second incarnation of the Dark Avengers launched their attack,New Avengers vol. 2 #19. Marvel Comics. Hand revealed to the New Avengers that she was actually a triple agent, pretending to work for Captain America while pretending to work for Norman Osborn while really working for Captain America, subsequently helping the New Avengers set a trap for Osborn to try and rescue the captured Captain America after Daredevil's heightened senses confirmed that she was telling the truth.New Avengers vol. 2 #22.

In other media Saffron Burrows as Victoria Hand in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Victoria Hand appears in four episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. season 1, portrayed by Saffron Burrows. She first appears in the episode \\"The Hub\\", as the titular S.H.I.E.L.D. base's director. Hand sends Grant Ward and Leo Fitz to South Ossetia to disable a weapon called Overkill. In the episode \\"The Magical Place\\", Hand leads the search for Phil Coulson after he is taken by Raina and Edison Po. In the episode \\"The End of the Beginning\\", Hand seizes control of the Bus and gives an order to kill everyone on the plane except for Coulson. In the episode \\"Turn, Turn, Turn\\", Hand and a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents weed out Hydra infiltrators. After John Garrett is exposed as a double agent, Hand brings him to the Fridge to have him incarcerated. En route however, Hand is murdered by Grant Ward, who is also a double-agent. A past version of Hand appears in the series finale, \\"The End is At Hand\\" and \\"What We're Fighting For\\", portrayed by Rachele Schank. Following the Chronicoms' attack on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s bases in 1983, Hand and the surviving agents regroup at a New York safe house and help the present day S.H.I.E.L.D. agents return to their time.

Thompkins, also known as Lottie Deno (April 21, 1844 ‚Äì February 9, 1934), was a famous gambler in the US state of Texas and New Mexico during the nineteenth century known for her poker skills as well as her courage.Rose, Cynthia, Handbook of TexasMelzer (2007), p. 170. She was born in Kentucky and traveled a great deal in her early adulthood before coming to Texas. Much of her earlier life and even her real name at birth are a matter of debate among historians, but her fame as a poker-player in the Southwest is not. According to author Johnny Hughes, \\"In the late 1800s Texas' most famous poker player was Lottie Deno (a shortened form of 'dinero'  Spanish for money).\\" Early life Carlotta J. Thompkins (her presumed real name) was born on April 21, 1844 in Warsaw, Kentucky.Blevins (2001), p. 55 Her family was reportedly quite wealthy and her father, a racehorse breeder and prominent gambler, is said to have traveled extensively with Lottie, teaching her the secrets of winning at cards at some of the finest casinos. After her father's death in the Civil War, Lottie's mother sent her to Detroit to find a husband. She was accompanied by Mary Poindexter, her loyal slave and nanny. After running out of money in Detroit, Thompkins fell into a life of gambling, traveling the Mississippi River. Poindexter, reportedly seven-feet tall and formidable, acted as Thompkins' protector during their travels. Gambling days in Texas Lottie arrived in San Antonio in 1865. She became a house gambler at the University Club working for the Thurmond family from Georgia. It was during this time that she met and fell in love with Frank Thurmond, a fellow gambler. After being accused of murder, Frank fled San Antonio and Lottie followed. The pair traveled for many years throughout the frontier areas of Texas, including Fort Concho, Jacksboro, San Angelo, Denison, Fort Worth, and Fort Griffin. Their travels occurred during a local economic boom on the Texas frontier as demand for bison hides spiked in the mid and late 1870s. Cowboys and traders flush with cash during the period became targets for gamblers in frontier communities. It was at Fort Griffin, where Lottie lingered for some time, that her notoriety and legend became most established. Fort Griffin, which was a frontier outpost west of Fort Worth near the Texas Panhandle, was known for its saloons and the rough element it attracted.Cashion (1997), p. 189. Gaining fame as a gambler Lottie became associated with various old west personalities, including Doc Holliday. During her travels she gained numerous nicknames. In San Antonio she was known as the \\"Angel of San Antonio.\\" At Fort Concho she became known as \\"Mystic Maud.\\" At Fort Griffin she was called \\"Queen of the Pasteboards\\" and \\"Lottie Deno.\\" It was this last moniker by which she became best known. Her escapades during this period became part of the folklore of the American Wild West. Later life Lottie and Frank moved to Kingston, New Mexico, in 1877, where they ran a gambling room in the Victorio Hotel. Lottie later became the owner of the Broadway Restaurant in Silver City. In 1880, Lottie and Frank were married in Silver City. In 1882 they moved to Deming, New Mexico, where they settled permanently and gave up their gambling life. They became upstanding citizens in the community, with Frank eventually becoming vice president of Deming National Bank and Lottie helping to found St. Luke's Episcopal Church. Lottie died on February 9, 1934 and was buried in Deming as Charlotte Thurmond. Legacy Miss Kitty Russell, a character from the long-running American radio and television show Gunsmoke, starring James Arness, is based on Lottie Deno. Lisa Gaye played Deno in the episode, \\"Lottie's Legacy\\" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Robert Taylor. In the dramatization, Lottie falls in love with the Reverend Peter Green (John Clarke), who does not know the details of her past.

Principal Double Bass at the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra, BBC Symphony Orchestra, New Philharmonia Orchestra, and finally the Philharmonia Orchestra of London. He formed the London Double Bass Ensemble in the 1980s.  Biography  Drucker was offered the position of principal double bass with the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra at the age of 20. He learned the violin as a child and switched to the double bass at 16. In 1953 came to London to lead the section in the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent. He was appointed Principal Double Bass of the New Philharmonia Orchestra (later the Philharmonia Orchestra) in 1964, under Otto Klemperer, and subsequently with Lorin Maazel who held the post of associate principal conductor. Riccardo Muti was principal conductor from 1973 to 1982. Giuseppe Sinopoli succeeded Muti. After he left the Philharmonia, Gerald continued in music as artist director promoting amongst others Vanessa- Mae and later of Min Jin (Violin) and Min Jung (Piano). He started his career as a violinist with the Boyd Neel String Orchestra at the age of 16, and was soon also playing with the Jacques Orchestra which was founded by Reginald Jacques five years previously. At the Guildhall School of Music he studied violin, viola, French horn (with Dennis Brain) and tuba in addition to the double bass. Poor eyesight prevented a wartime call-up in 1939‚Äì1940, so he earned pocket money playing in dance bands (often with the American bandleader Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York. His first professional engagement in London during the war had been playing the organ at St Mary Magdalene church, Holloway Road, subsequently working as a violinist or violist with both the leading chamber orchestras of the time, the Boyd Neel Orchestra and the Jacques String Orchestra.and his first encounter with the double bass was when he was invited to fill in for double bassist Gordon Pearce at an ENSA concert for Canadian Troops on the south coast prior to D-day in 1944. Asked to join the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent in 1953, when the principal Stuart Knussen moved to the London Symphony Orchestra, Drucker relocated to London and stayed at the BBC until 1964, once deputising on the tuba at short notice in Walton's First Symphony.The BBC Symphony Orchestra: the first fifty years, 1930‚Äì1980 by Nicholas Kenyon.

He has appeared as soloist in concerto performances, including performances of work by Bottesini and Virgilio Mortari (including in \\"Bottesini's Grand Duo for violin and Double Bass and Mortari's double bass concerto) with the Philharmonia under Riccardo Muti at the Royal Festival Hall on 16 February 1978.The Times newspaper. February 17, 1978. Drucker was involved in many freelance sessions over the years including at Abbey Road recording studios where amongst others he and fellow Philharmonia double bass player Gordon Pearce were involved in the recording of the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. He thoroughly enjoyed playing music and exploring the TARDIS set in the Doctor Who cult science fiction BBC TV series during his involvement in the 1960s‚Äì1970s including with Tom Baker in The Ribos Operation. Other session examples notably include his involvement in over 13 James Bond 007 films with composer John Barry amongst others as the John Barry Orchestra between 1963 and 1990, and included working closely with Paul McCartney on \\"Live and Let Die\\" which is the main theme song of the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Paul's band Wings. Drucker was solo bass player in the Anton Chekhov film 'Romance with a Double Bass' released in 1974 with John Cleese as the main character.Romance with a Double Bass. 1974. Anton Films. In 1980 he formed a unique group, the London Double Bass Ensemble, comprising a nucleus of four double basses, to perform original works in concert with other instruments. Drucker commissioned a new piece of work by the English composer Robert Simpson in 1981, Quintet for Clarinet, Bass Clarinet and String Trio (Simpson) which was performed by the London Double Bass Ensemble at Wigmore Hall that year. Gerald was succeeded by Neil Tarlton as Principal Bass at the Philharmonia Orchestra.Tarlton, Neil.

As of August 2020, the video has received over 876 million views. The 56-second-long video, which was uploaded on YouTube in May 2007, features Harry Davies-Carr (who was aged three) and Charlie Davies-Carr (aged one), two brothers from the United Kingdom. The two are seen sitting in a chair when Harry puts his finger into Charlie's mouth and gets bitten. \\"Charlie bit me,\\" he observes and puts his finger back into Charlie's mouth, which gets it bitten harder. Harry, who is hurt, says \\"Ouch\\" repeatedly and his brother begins to giggle. Afterwards, Harry smiles and repeats \\"Charlie bit me. And that really hurt.\\" Background Howard Davies- Carr, the father of the boys, said the video was \\"simply an attempt to capture the boys growing up\\". While watching the finger-biting scene on his camera after recording it, it \\"didn't particularly stand out\\". It was not until he transferred the video onto his computer a few weeks later and played it again that he found it to be comedic. The Davies-Carr family lives in the United Kingdom. Howard uploaded the video onto YouTube so that it could be watched by the boys' grandfather, who was living in the United States. He chose YouTube because the size of the video file was so big that it could not be sent by email. Originally the video was set to private and he mentions, \\"I was just about to remove (the video) before it exploded. but once it had (exploded) I had lost control of the clip anyway so I left it.\\" Howard commented on the video: \\"The clip only went up as I wanted to share it with the boys' grandfather. I was naive about the whole YouTube thing. It became viral and once that happened there was nothing I could do. People have sent lovely comments and messages and I now upload a new video of the boys every six weeks.\\" Views \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" had received 2.6 million views on YouTube by the start of February 2008 and 12 million views by March 2008. In December 2008, it was the twelfth most viewed video on YouTube with 65 million views. By April 2009, the video had received 92 million hits. It became the second most viewed video in August 2009, and took over the title as the most viewed video ever at the end of October 2009, when it surpassed Evolution of Dance. By November 2009, \\"Charlie Bit My Finger ‚Äì Again!\\" had received over 130 million views. In addition to being the most viewed, it was also the \\"most favourited\\" and the second \\"most discussed\\" video on the website in the United Kingdom. In a May 2009 report compiled by Visible Measures, which measures video hits across 150 video-sharing websites, \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" was the thirteenth most viewed viral video on the Internet. This then earned the a place on the big fat quiz of the naughties as the mystery guests, where Noel Fielding guest they were attacked by baboons. By the end of 2011, it had been surpassed by music videos Justin Bieber's \\"Baby\\", Lady Gaga's \\"Bad Romance\\", Eminem feat. Rihanna's \\"Love the Way You Lie\\", Shakira's \\"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\\" and Jennifer Lopez feat. Pitbull's \\"On The Floor\\", becoming the 6th most viewed video on YouTube. Despite being able to regain its position to number 3 (and becoming the third YouTube video to reach 800 million views), it has been since surpassed by many other videos, dropping out of 30 most viewed YouTube videos. As of September 2019 it has received over 870 million views. As of June 2020, the video had reached 874 million views, with over 2 million likes. Legacy As a result of the video's inadvertent fame, the boys gained recognition. Following the video, multiple clips were uploaded by their father to YouTube. They feature Jasper, the third child in the family. Shelley Davies-Carr, their mother, commented on the success: \\"Susan Boyle has never had the hits we have had. The video got on to a college networking site in the U.S. and from there it went viral. I think the British accents have helped make it so globally viewed.\\" According to a 2008 interview with Shelley, the boys feel embarrassed when they see themselves on television. She also noted that in 2008 they were \\"shy about their new fame.\\" Howard commented in 2009 that his sons \\"are now almost legendary. People want their autographs, it's just crazy.\\" In their list of YouTube's 50 greatest viral videos, Time ranked \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" as number one. The video's lasting impact was underscored by the Davies-Carr family's appearance as mystery guests on Channel 4's Big Fat Quiz of the '00s on 30 September 2012. Among the references to the video includes an episode of the U.S. television series The Office. In a 2012 interview Howard Davies-Carr discussed the pitfalls of his sons' accidental fame saying, \\"There are an awful lot of unscrupulous people out there who will try and take advantage of people that don't understand what they have.\\" When it comes to the topic of the boys getting older, the boys' father has reflected, \\"When the boys get to 18, I'd like them to think back and think, 'O.K., I've got something in my life which is more than just what I was when I did the 'Charlie Bit Me' video.\\" The parents have passed on invitations to talk shows and on making public appearances in media outlets. In 2014, during his \\"After The Oscar's Special\\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Jimmy Kimmel enlisted the help of many big-name celebrities to showcase some of YouTube's greatest videos. The first video to be showcased was \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" and was parodied in a video entitled \\"Bitman Begins\\" and featured Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, and brothers Chris & Liam Hemsworth. Chris played the role of Harry, while Liam played the role of Charlie. The video was a mock trailer for a film featuring the actors. The climactic scene takes place on the roof of a building where Harry wants revenge on Charlie for biting his finger. \\"Harry\\" screams the line \\"Charlie bit me, Charlie bit my finger!\\" They fall off the roof onto the street below. \\"Harry\\" then utters the famous line \\"Ouch Charlie, that really hurt\\" while \\"Charlie\\" just laughs. In an April 2015 interview, Charlie said he thought it was \\"a bit odd that loads of people have watched it.\\" Also according to the interview, Charlie and Harry's parents have made \\"thousands\\" from the video through advertising and sponsorship. The Davies-Carr family now includes two additional sons, Jasper and Rupert. Osama bin Laden had the video in his computer's audio/visual collection. A sound- clip from this video features in the first track (\\"Pulse 8\\") of the 2015 album Integrity by grime MC Jme.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVdNt2Mmk10 Financial impact It was reported that in 2011 the family made over ¬£100,000 in advertising revenue from the video. The profit from the video was enough that the family could afford to purchase a new house. Their success has been compared to winning a lottery, a so-called \\"meme lottery\\". Since the \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" video was posted, other videos of babies have gone \\"viral\\" on YouTube and the families are monetising them, often making over US$100,000. In response to requests from viewers online the family created \\"Charlie Bit My Finger\\" T-shirts, mugs and limited edition calendars. The family signed into a partnership with a Viral Spiral, a viral meme video management company specialising in viral videos, which has helped place the viral video in meme advertisements for companies like Sprint and helped to create a viral meme brand. There was also news of a web series featuring the boys in the works.

Green Pine was exported to India, and its advanced version, the Green Pine Block-B, was delivered to South Korea at a cost of $83 million apiece, and to Azerbaijan. The Israeli Air Defense Command within the Israeli Air Force (IAF) of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) operates both Green Pine radars and Green Pine Block-B radars as an integral part of the Arrow system. History The Arrow program was launched as a response to the acquisition by Arab states of long range surface-to-surface missiles. The United States and Israel signed a memorandum of understanding to co-fund it in 1986, and in 1988 the United States Department of Defense Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) placed an order with Israel Aircraft Industries for the Arrow 1 technology demonstrator. Over the years SDIO was renamed to Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), and later to Missile Defense Agency (MDA), while Israel Aircraft Industries was renamed to Israel Aerospace Industries. The Gulf War, which exposed the controversial performance. Retrieved 2009-10-09. of the Patriot missile against Iraqi \\"Al Hussein\\" missiles, gave further impetus to the development of the Arrow. It was initially designed to intercept missiles such as the SS-1 \\"Scud\\", its \\"Al Hussein\\" derivative, the SS-21 \\"Scarab\\" operated by Syria, and the CSS-2 operated by Saudi Arabia. The Arrow evolved also with an eye on the advanced missile programs of Iran. Elta was awarded the contract to develop and manufacture the EL/M-2080 Green Pine radar in 1992. The Green Pine was developed from the Elta Music phased array radar, presented in November 1994, rolled out in 1995, and turned operational in November 1998. The Green Pine has since been used in dozens of tests of the Arrow system. In 2000 it was revealed that the Green Pine detected the launch of a Syrian Scud-D missile from its base outside Aleppo in northern Syria, and tracked its full trajectory until its impact point, some in the southern desert. In 2005, and in 2008, Green Pine detected and tracked similar drills of Syrian Scuds. On July 29, 2004, Israel and the United States carried out a joint test at the Naval Air Station Point Mugu (NAS Point Mugu) Missile Test Center in California, in which the Arrow interceptor was launched against a real Scud-B missile. The test represented a realistic scenario that could not have been tested in Israel due to test-field safety restrictions. To enable the test a full battery was shipped to Point Mugu. The Green Pine radar and command-and-control systems were deployed at the base, while the Arrow launcher was installed offshore on an island that forms part of the test range. The test was a success, with the interceptor destroying the Scud that flew a trajectory at an altitude of , west of San Nicolas Island. This was the seventh test of the complete system, the first interception of a real Scud. As of 2012 the Green Pine radar has a proven track record demonstrated in over 20 successful ballistic missile intercepts. Specifications alt=Stages of missile interception by the Arrow system, using Green Pine radar. In contrast to the older AN/MPQ-53 Passive Electronically Scanned Array (PESA) radar set of the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-2, the Green Pine is an active electronically scanned array (AESA) solid state radar. Unlike the advanced AN/TPY-2 X band radar of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, Green Pine operates at L band - in the 500 MHz to 2,000 MHz range. Green Pine reportedly operates in search, detection, tracking, and missile guidance modes simultaneously, capable of detecting targets at ranges of up to about , and is able to track more than 30 targets at speeds over . It discriminates targets from natural clutter and countermeasures, illuminates the true target and guides the missile to within of the target. The effective radiated power (ERP) of the Green Pine also makes it a possible candidate for conversion into a directed- energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles. The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components. The radar system includes a wide by high trailer-mounted rotatable antenna array, a power system, a cooling system and a radar control center. The power system has both no-break and transformer containers, with the former including a diesel generator, an inductive clutch control module and a diesel fuel tank. The transformer container houses transformers, a service generator, a direct current converter and switching racks. The radar's cooling system is a heat exchanger that makes use of inherently redundant cascade cooling machines and incorporates an integral coolant tank and control panels. The radar is made up of 2,000‚Äì2,300 transmit‚Äìreceive modules and weighs . The system is transportable rather than mobile, as it can be moved to other prepared sites, but cannot be set up just anywhere. According to its developer, Green Pine's deployment at a new operational site takes \\"less than 24 hours\\". Green Pine Block-B An advanced version of the radar, called EL/M-2080S Super Green Pine, Green Pine Block-B, or Great Pine (, ), is to take the place of the original Green Pine. It is composed of more powerful but smaller transmit‚Äìreceive modules with better capabilities than those of the Green Pine, and is believed to produce double the power output, extending detection range to about . In October 2010 the IDF decided to put another Arrow 2 battery into operational use. The new battery received the new radar - Green Pine Block-B. Green Pine Block-C Green Pine Block-C has been revealed in November 2018. Users ;: According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute report, an arms deal signed between Israel and Azerbaijan in 2011 considers import of one Green Pine radar. ;: Israel had deployed at least 2 Green Pine radars as an integral part of the Arrow system. As of 2008 an unknown number of both Green Pine and Green Pine Block-B versions were active. As of 2012, the first Green Pine Block-B was declared operational and is deployed alongside the two Green Pines. ;: India had acquired and deployed two Green Pine radars around July 2002 and another one in August 2005. The Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organisation is an acknowledged derivative of the original Green Pine. The Indian government has sought to purchase the complete Arrow system since 1999, but in early 2002 the U.S. vetoed Israel's request to sell the Arrow 2 missiles to India, exercising its right as a major funding contributor. U.S. officials argued that the sale would violate the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). ;: South Korea bought two Green Pine Block-B radars, which became operational in 2012.

Gaza Street or Gaza Road ( - Derech Aza) is a main street in Rehavia neighborhood in Jerusalem, Israel. History Gaza Street in the snow, 2002. The street is named Gaza Street because it was built on a part of the historical road from Jaffa Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem to the south Mediterranean coast, including Gaza City. During the first half of the 20th century, most of the street's residents were wealthy German Jews (e.g., minister Yosef Burg), who kept up their European lifestyle and language even calling the street \\"Gaza Stra√üe\\". Thus, the name of the intersection of Gaza and Rabbi Chaim Berlin streets, \\"Gaza-Berlin Corner\\", becoming a slang term describing the neighborhoods population. Landmarks Aside from being important for commuting, it holds its own commercial and cultural value. The official residence of Israel's Prime Minister is located on the street and therefore demonstrations often will take place at the Paris Square across from the official residence. In 2007, the square was symbolically renamed the \\"Freedom for Jonathan Pollard Square\\". Gaza Street begins at the intersection of Paris Square, King George, Keren HaYesod and Rambam streets, and it spans until the intersection with Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog Avenue next to the Valley of the Cross (\\"Emeq HaMatzleva\\") and the Monastery of the Cross. There are many caf√©s, restaurants and other commercial activity on the street. Architecture Most of Gaza Street's buildings are designed in the Bauhaus style common to the neighborhood and are faced with Jerusalem stone. Most are apartment buildings, no taller than four floors and featuring gardens.

Each of these chicken sheds contains 25 birds and are moved their length every day, providing fresh ground for the hens to feed on and also ensuring that the chicken manure is spread across the whole field. chicken house in Dolores, Colorado Chicken sheds at Balado Airfield, Scotland. Poultry sheds like this are common in the Kinross area of Scotland. Manure from the sheds is now collected for use as fuel in a biomass-burning power station at Westfield in Fife. Chicken manure is the feces of chickens used as an organic fertilizer, especially for soil low in nitrogen. Of all animal manures, it has the highest amount of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Chicken manure is sometimes pelletized for use as a fertilizer, and this product may have additional phosphorus, potassium or nitrogen added. Optimal storage conditions for chicken manure include keeping it in a covered area and retaining its liquid, because a significant amount of nitrogen exists in the urine. Fresh chicken manure contains 0.5% to 0.9% nitrogen, 0.4% to 0.5% phosphorus, and 1.2% to 1.7 %potassium. One chicken produces approximately 8‚Äì11 pounds of manure monthly. Chicken manure can be used to create homemade plant fertilizer. Studies In 1986, a master's thesis study in the Philippines compared the effects of using various fertilizers to enhance milkfish production in brackish water ponds. The study compared the use of using chicken manure only, cow manure only, 16-20-0 fertilizer only, a mixture of cow manure and 16-20-0 fertilizer, a mixture of chicken manure and 16-20-0 fertilizer, and a control group that used no fertilizer. The study concluded that the use of cow manure only as a fertilizer fared best, and the use of chicken manure only as a fertilizer fared second best. Pollution Mass applications of chicken manure may create an unpleasant odor. In April 2014 in Escondido, California, a golf course that had \\"dumped\\" chicken manure on its grounds was cited by the county government after complaints from local residents about the odor. In December 2011, the environmental group Environment Maryland asserted that water runoff from agricultural land fertilized with chicken manure was increasing the pollution levels of Chesapeake Bay. The group asserted that excessive phosphorus from the runoff was contributing to the increase of dead zones in the bay. In 2015, in efforts to address the matter before leaving office, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley put a new regulation into use that \\"would have limited the amount of poultry manure that Eastern Shore farmers can use on their fields\\". However, the following Governor Larry Hogan quickly absolved the new regulation after being sworn into office. The runoff problem has been attributed to the use of \\"an outdated scientific tool for calculating the correct amount of manure\\". A proposed solution from scientists at the University of Maryland is to have farmers use a new (corrected) formula to calculate proper quantities of chicken manure for agricultural uses. Human deterrent Chicken manure has been used as a human deterrent. In July 2013, in Abbotsford, British Columbia, city workers applied chicken manure at a tent encampment to deter homeless people from the area. The affected homeless planned on initiating small claims lawsuits for loss of property and property damage. One of the affected homeless people described the tactics of city workers as \\"a chicken shit way to do things\\". The mayor of Abbotsford and the Fraser Valley city manager later apologized regarding the incident. Similar instances of using chicken manure in this manner have occurred in British Columbia in Surrey and in Port Coquitlam, the latter of which occurred \\"shortly after the Abbotsford incident\\".

This Victorian-style house, still owned by Benton descendants, was built in 1898 and is one of the oldest homes in Fort Worth. The descendants have preserved the cottage's architecture features, including the one-and-a-half-story structure and the fence that has surrounded the cottage since it was first built. As a family home, it is not open to the public. The Benton House is individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its architectural qualities. In 1971, the Benton House was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark. History The Benton House was owned by a tobacco seller, Meredith A. Benton, and his wife, Ella Belle. M. A. Benton's father, a Kansas City builder, erected the house for the couple in 1898. It was built originally with a barn and hayloft and a two-room servants‚Äô house, but the servants‚Äô quarters were redesigned into a garage building in 1937. Ella Belle Benton lived alone for most of the time because her husband was an active civic worker. She helped start the Rose Gardens, now part of the Fort Worth Botanic Garden, as well as a public kindergarten program. Features The Benton House is a Victorian gingerbread home. Made of cypress, it contains six rooms, a central hall, and tiled fireplaces. Some special features of this house are an asymmetrical floorplan, fine spindle work, cross gables over a hipped roof, and a cutaway window.

Instrument drivers are specified by the IVI Foundation and define an I/O abstraction layer using the virtual instrument software architecture (VISA). The VISA hardware abstraction layer provides an interface-independent communication channel to T&M; instruments. Furthermore, the instrument drivers encapsulate the Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments (SCPI) commands, which are an ASCII-based set of commands for reading and writing instrument settings and measurement data. This standard allows an abstract way of using various programming languages to program remote-control applications instead of using SCPI commands. An instrument driver usually has a well-defined API. Standards VXIplug&play; instrument driver The VXIplug&play; Systems Alliance was founded in 1993 with the aim of unifying VXI hardware and software to achieve 'plug and play' interoperability for VXI and GPIB instruments. As part of the unifying process, VXIplug&play; instrument drivers were also defined. IVI instrument drivers When the IVI Foundation took over the Alliance in 2002, it defined a new generation of instrument drivers to replace the VXIplug&play; standard. The IVI instrument driver specification intends to overcome the drawbacks of VXIplug&play.; These IVI (Interchangeable Virtual Instrumentation) drivers are currently defined in three different architectures: # The IVI-COM driver architecture is based on the Microsoft Component Object Model. # The IVI-C drivers are based on C programming language shared components (shared libraries). # The IVI.NET driver architecture was specified in 2010. The IVI.NET drivers are based on the .NET framework. Remote control of instrumentation Instrument drivers allow quicker development of remote- control applications for instrumentation. The drivers reduce the difficulty of string formatting when using SCPI commands by providing a well-defined API. The IVI and VXIplug&play; Instrument Drivers use the VISA as the hardware abstraction layer so that hardware-independent applications can be developed. I/O hardware abstraction layer VISA The VISA library allows test and measurement equipment to be connected through various hardware interfaces. The following interfaces are available: * Serial Port * GPIB/IEEE-488 * VXI-11 (over TCP/IP) * USB488/USBTMC (USB Test & Measurement), USB Test & Measurement Class Specification * HiSLIP (over TCP/IP).

The Arapahoe Formation consists of alluvial fan and fluvial deposits that prograded eastward from the growing Rocky Mountain Front Ranges. It rests unconformably on the Laramie Formation, and is conformably overlain by the Denver Formation. It reaches a maximum thickness of about . The base of the Arapahoe Formation is marked by a discontinuous conglomerate, or where the conglomerate is absent, by sandstone beds that commonly contain large ironstone concretions. The conglomerate is composed principally of chert pebbles, but pebbles of granite, gneiss and schist are also present. Medium grey to brown claystone makes up the majority of the formation, with lesser amounts of light grey to light brown quartzose sandstone. The formation top is marked by a change from sandstone and claystone to the tuffaceous sediments of the overlying Denver Formation. In 2002 the Arapahoe Formation was included as part of a larger unconformity-bounded unit named the D1 Sequence, in order to facilitate basin-wide studies and avoid confusion arising from the lateral and vertical facies changes that occur within the Denver Basin. The base of the D1 coincides with the base of the Arapahoe Formation and is marked by the abrupt change to conglomerate at the top of the Laramie Formation.

(born 9 March 1953, in North Battleford) is a curator, artist, and author and a Plains Cree member of the Siksika Nation.Abbot, Larry. Gerald McMaster: Plains Cree. A Time of Visions. (retrieved 20 Nov 2009) McMaster is a professor at OCAD University and is the adjunct curator at the Remai Modern in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Early life and education Gerald McMaster was born in 1953 and grew up on the Red Pheasant First Nation reserve in Saskatchewan, Canada. His father is Blackfoot, while his mother is Plains Cree. He says he grew up listening to Lone Ranger and Hopalong Cassidy on the radio, while avidly reading western comic books ‚Äì all of which would later influence his art. McMaster says, \\"I've been an urban Indian since the age of nine. I've attended art school in the United States, trained in the Western tradition; yet I am referred to as an 'Indian' artist. I have danced and sung in the traditional powwow style of Northern Plains, yet my musical tastes are global ...\\" McMaster studied art at the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico, from 1973 to 1975. He earned his BFA from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He earned his master's degree in Anthropology and Sociology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario,Ryan, 297 and continued his studies at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.Newlands, 210 Artwork McMaster draws and paints with humour and an ironic juxtaposition of traditional and contemporary pop culture elements. Identities, fluid and multiple, are central to his art practice. In his piece Eclectic Baseball, \\"traditional Plains Indian symbols of warfare and sacred ceremony were freely mixed with symbols and actual equipment of contemporary baseball\\". One of his best known series is The cowboy/Indian Show. Hide painting, pictographs, and petroglyphs inspire his methods of representation. He works in oil and acrylic. In 1995, he ceased being a full-time artist in order to devote more time to curating, critical theory, and writing. Career Gerald McMaster in a panel discussion with Paul Chaat Smith and Joseph Sanchez From 1977 to 1981, McMaster coordinated the Indian Art Program and was an instructor at the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan. Beginning in 1981, he was curator of Contemporary Indian Art at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. McMaster has curated a number of thought-provoking contemporary Native art shows, including INDIGENA at the Canadian Museum of Civilization.Showcase: Sharing the Circle. Saskatchewan Arts Board.

It is named after type section outcrops near Austin, Texas. The formation is made up of chalk and marl.US Geological Survey, Austin Chalk Fossils The putative galloanseran bird Austinornis lentus has been found in the Austin Chalk.Weishampel, et al. (2004). \\"Dinosaur distribution.\\" Pp. 517-607.J. A. Clarke. 2004. Morphology, phylogenetic taxonomy, and systematics of Ichthyornis and Apatornis (Avialae: Ornithurae). Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 286:1-179. The general absence of dinosaurs is a reflection of the Austin limestone being marine in origin, primarily composed of microscopic shell fragments from floating sea organisms known as \\"coccolithophores\\" (the same organisms that contributed to the White Cliffs of Dover, on the south coast of England). Nevertheless, the Austin Chalk will occasionally produce fossils of larger creatures, such as Inoceramus clams, ammonite cephalopods, and large marine vertebrates such as Xiphactinus, a predaceous fish. Geology The rocks of the Austin Chalk consist of recrystallized, fossiliferous, interbedded chalks and marls. Exposures of Austin Chalk are mainly seen in quarries, roadcuts, and stream beds where water eroded the soil. Austin Chalk outcrops can be seen throughout Dallas, and extend south underneath I-35 down into Austin and San Antonio. Volcanic ash layers are present in the Austin chalk, and dates obtained from radioactive minerals in these ash layers indicate they were deposited by wind from distant erupting volcanoes around 86 mya. These eruptions occurred along a 250-mile long by 50 mile wide belt of submarine volcanoes, which are located in present-day south-central Texas. This belt of volcanoes coincides with the trend of the Balcones Fault zone and is known as the Balcones volcanic province. Evidence of these ancient volcanoes is only visible in a few places as most were buried by the Austin and Taylor Group, and now are in the subsurface. The presence of this volcanism during deposition of the Austin Chalk is correlated with the Laramide orogeny. Sea level rose for conditions to be right for the deposition of the Austin Chalk, which also coincides with the maximum extent of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The depths of the deposition of the Austin Chalk occurred in ~250 m or 820 ft of water, well- suited to the deposition of coccoliths.

Valley-Dynamo, Inc. (officially Valley-Dynamo Limited Partnership or VDLP for short) is a gaming and sporting goods manufacturing company. It has been the dominant manufacturer of coin- operated pool tables in North America for over 6 decades, and produces the US- ubiquitous Valley brand and decreasingly common Dynamo brand (once a competitor). The company also manufactures other market-leader brand names, including Tornado brand table football (foosball), Dynamo air hockey, and Champion indoor shuffleboard tables, as well as Sun Glo shuffleboard equipment, for both the home and coin-op markets. The company has distributors in some two dozen countries. Annual sales were up to US$15-17 mil, as of May 2009, at which time Valley-Dynamo employed around 125 workers in its larger centers (approximately 60 at the Champion factory in Texas, 40 at the Valley plant in Mexico (since relocated to Texas), and 25 or so at a Grand Prairie distribution center), plus office support staff, and employees of Valley- operated leagues (see below). History As Valley Co., the original company was founded by Earl Feddick in 1947 in Bay City, Michigan, where it remained under the auspices of a series of controlling companies including Kidde Inc., U.S. Industries, and Fenway Partners with Rickett still the majority shareholder. In 1999, then known as Valley Recreation Products, Valley absorbed and merged with both Tornado Table Sports and Dynamo Corp., and centralized operations at the Dynamo facilities in Richland Hills, Texas (a Dallas-Ft. Worth suburb). The increasingly market-dominant enterprise was bought for US$34.5 million by, and was made a subsidiary of, Brunswick Corporation in 2003, as Valley-Dynamo LLC. Brunswick moved Valley-Dynamo's manufacturing operations to Reynosa, Mexico in 2006. In 2009, Valley-Dynamo \\"was acquired by a limited partnership controlled by Kelye Stites,\\" owner of Champion Shuffleboard Ltd., \\"and other businesses in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.\\" The sale amount was not disclosed, but was rumored to be surprisingly low (3 to 5 million...a steal). Stites, the son-in-law of Valley Co. founder Rickett, decided to move pool and air hockey table production from Mexico back to Texas. Under the new partnership, in which Stites is the majority owner, Valley-Dynamo absorbed Champion's shuffleboard brand rather than vice versa, with Stites citing Valley-Dynamo's widespread brand name recognition. Leagues Valley created, and wholly owns, the highly competitive, international amateur Valley National 8-Ball League Association (VNEA; no longer accurately named - since the 1990s it has become multinational and includes nine-ball and other pool disciplines). All VNEA matches must be played on Operator/Charter Holder owned pool tables only. The company also founded the Valley International Foosball Association (VIFA). The majority of American Poolplayers Association (APA) matches are also played on Valley- Dynamo tables, including the APA International Championships, although APA has no rules with regard to what brand or size of table is used.

He became a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 30th century, during the \\"Five Years Later\\" era. Creator Tom Bierbaum said this about Devlin's origin: \\" My original sketch when I conceived of Devlin had him with a similar emblem with three stars in a row across the middle of the circle (inspired by the \\"belt of Orion\\" section of the constellation) and the early depictions of Devlin had the three stars, but it later was simplified to a single star, probably by Keith, maybe when he was doing quick thumbnail layouts for Jason Pearson.\\" Fictional character biography Devlin O'Ryan is a native of the planet Xanthu. His mother was the Xanthu bureau chief of the Daily Planet, and Devlin decided to follow in her footsteps and become a journalist. Obtaining an internship with the Interstellar Press, he soon found himself working out of the Metropolis offices of the Daily Planet, alongside its star reporter Iris West Allen (the widow of Barry Allen, the 20th century superhero known as the Flash). Devlin and Iris were the first reporters to expose the Dominators' covert influence (and effective control) of Earth's government. His investigation led him to Winath as the Legion of Super-Heroes was being reformed by Reep Daggle (Chameleon Boy) and Rokk Krin (Cosmic Boy), and he decided to accompany them.

However, Devlin joined the adult Legion, and when the two groups parted ways, so did the young couple.

The song is also included in collections of socialist and labor songs.  Lyrics  The song has many lyrical variations, though usually each stanza follows a standard form, with one sentence that differs from one stanza to the next. The song often begins: With the chorus: Other lines that can appear in stanzas, in place of \\"Gonna lay down my burden\\", include: * Gonna lay down my heavy load * Gonna lay down my sword and shield * Gonna stick my sword in the golden sand * Gonna try on my long white robe * Gonna try on my starry crown * Gonna put on my golden shoes * Gonna talk with the Prince of Peace * Gonna shake hands around the world * Gonna cross the river Jordan * Gonna climb upon that mountain * Gonna climb the road to heaven Themes The song suggests baptism in water, using the metaphor of crossing the River Jordan to enter the Promised Land in the Old Testament. The refrain of \\"ain't gonna study war no more\\" is a reference to a quotation found in the book of Isaiah, chapter 2, verse 4 (KJV): \\"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\\" Recordings Artists who have recorded the song include: *Al Hirt released a version on his 1961 album, He's the King and His Band.Al Hirt, He's the King and His Band Retrieved April 6, 2013. and a live version on his 1965 album, Live at Carnegie HallAl Hirt, Live at Carnegie Hall Retrieved April 11, 2013. * American R&B; and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album The Red One. * Arty Hall & His Radio Rubes, 1937 * Benjamin Luxton & David Willison, 1924 * Sister Rosetta Tharpe, 1944 * Big Bill Broonzy, 1952 * Bill Haley & His Comets performed a live twist version on the 1962 album Twistin' Knights at the Roundtable. * Bing Crosby and Gary Crosby (recorded November 4, 1953 ‚Äì reached No. 28 in the UK charts). * The Blind Boys of Alabama (on Amazing Grace and Down in New Orleans) * Bunk Johnson, 1942 * Chim√®ne Badi, 2011 (Gospel & Soul album) * Chris Barber¬¥s Jazz Band, 1954 * Clara Ward * Cliff Holland * C.

Design Walls of Rome uses an improved version of Sieges game engine. The game was designed by Ali Atabek, Scott Baker, Paul Kellner, and James Thomas, with Kellner also serving as the project coordinator, and Thomas as the lead programmer. The game featured art by Scott Baker, Steve Beam, Steve Burke, and Juan L. Galceran. Plot Walls of Rome is a tactical war game about sieges in the time of the Roman Empire. In this game, the player takes the role of either attacker or defender in a siege assault on a fortification. Each side has an assortment of weapons, troops, and techniques, ranging from Phoenicians to Roman auxiliaries, to cavalry, and from siege towers to Greek fire. The player can also build scenarios and play them or trade them with a friend who also owns the game. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1994 stated that Walls of Rome \\"vastly improved\\" on Sieges game engine and AI. The magazine concluded that it \\"is not only a solid extension of the original Siege engine, it offers loads of replay value as well\\". The game was reviewed in 1994 in Dragon #207 by Sandy Petersen in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Walls of Rome was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds Wargame of the Year award in June 1994, losing to Clash of Steel. The editors wrote of the game, \\"In this sequel to Siege, the AI is less predictable than in the previous releases, the historical research is extremely solid (including many obscure battles that you can't find anywhere else and historical uniforms/banners which are something of a miniaturist's dream), and a multi-player modem capacity that takes the game up another notch in our opinion\\".

Gall and Spurzheim were the first to observe the crossing of pyramidal tracts, thus explaining why lesions in one hemisphere are manifested in the opposite side of the body. However, Gall and Spurzheim did not attempt to justify phrenology on anatomical grounds. It has been argued that phrenology was fundamentally a science of race. Gall considered the most compelling argument in favor of phrenology the differences in skull shape found in sub-Saharan Africans and the anecdotal evidence (due to scientific travelers and colonists) of their intellectual inferiority and emotional volatility. In Italy, Luigi Rolando carried out lesion experiments and performed electrical stimulation of the brain, including the Rolandic area. Phineas Gage's accident Phineas Gage became one of the first lesion case studies in 1848 when an explosion drove a large iron rod completely through his head, destroying his left frontal lobe. He recovered with no apparent sensory, motor, or gross cognitive deficits, but with behaviour so altered that friends described him as \\"no longer being Gage,\\" suggesting that the damaged areas are involved in \\"higher functions\\" such as personality.Blair., R. (2004) The roles of orbital frontal cortex in the modulation of antisocial behaviour Brain and Cognition 55 pp. 198‚Äì208 However, Gage's mental changes are usually grossly exaggerated in modern presentations. Subsequent cases (such as Broca's patient Tan) gave further support to the doctrine of specialization.  Major theories of the brain  Currently, there are two major theories of the brain's cognitive function. The first is the theory of modularity. Stemming from phrenology, this theory supports functional specialization, suggesting the brain has different modules that are domain specific in function. The second theory, distributive processing, proposes that the brain is more interactive and its regions are functionally interconnected rather than specialized. Each orientation plays a role within certain aims and tend to complement each other (see below section \`Collaboration¬¥).  Modularity  The theory of modularity suggests that there are functionally specialized regions in the brain that are domain specific for different cognitive processes.Caramazza, A., Coltheart, M. Cognitive Neuropsychology twenty years on. Cognitive Neuropsychology. Psychology Press. 23(1), 3‚Äì12. (2006) Jerry Fodor expanded the initial notion of phrenology by creating his Modularity of the Mind theory. The Modularity of the Mind theory indicates that distinct neurological regions called modules are defined by their functional roles in cognition. He also rooted many of his concepts on modularity back to philosophers like Descartes, who wrote about the mind being composed of \\"organs\\" or \\"psychological faculties\\". An example of Fodor's concept of modules is seen in cognitive processes such as vision, which have many separate mechanisms for colour, shape and spatial perception.Fodor, J. A. (1983). The Modularity of the Mind. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (pg 2‚Äì47) One of the fundamental beliefs of domain specificity and the theory of modularity suggests that it is a consequence of natural selection and is a feature of our cognitive architecture. Researchers Hirschfeld and Gelman propose that because the human mind has evolved by natural selection, it implies that enhanced functionality would develop if it produced an increase in \\"fit\\" behaviour. Research on this evolutionary perspective suggests that domain specificity is involved in the development of cognition because it allows one to pinpoint adaptive problems.Hirschfeld, L. A., Gelman, S. A. (1994) Mapping the Mind: Domain specificity in cognition and culture. Cambridge University Press pg 37‚Äì169 An issue for the modular theory of cognitive neuroscience is that there are cortical anatomical differences from person to person. Although many studies of modularity are undertaken from very specific lesion case studies, the idea is to create a neurological function map that applies to people in general. To extrapolate from lesion studies and other case studies this requires adherence to the universality assumption, that there is no difference, in a qualitative sense, between subjects who are intact neurologically. For example, two subjects would fundamentally be the same neurologically before their lesions, and after have distinctly different cognitive deficits. Subject 1 with a lesion in the \\"A\\" region of the brain may show impaired functioning in cognitive ability \\"X\\" but not \\"Y\\", while subject 2 with a lesion in area \\"B\\" demonstrates reduced \\"Y\\" ability but \\"X\\" is unaffected; results like these allow inferences to be made about brain specialization and localization, also known as using a double dissociation. The difficulty with this theory is that in typical non-lesioned subjects, locations within the brain anatomy are similar but not completely identical. There is a strong defense for this inherent deficit in our ability to generalize when using functional localizing techniques (fMRI, PET etc.). To account for this problem, the coordinate-based Talairach and Tournoux stereotaxic system is widely used to compare subjects' results to a standard brain using an algorithm. Another solution using coordinates involves comparing brains using sulcal reference points. A slightly newer technique is to use functional landmarks, which combines sulcal and gyral landmarks (the groves and folds of the cortex) and then finding an area well known for its modularity such as the fusiform face area. This landmark area then serves to orient the researcher to the neighboring cortex.Saxe, R., Brett, M., Kanwisher, N. Divide and conquer: A defense of functional localizers. Neuroimage. 2006. Future developments for modular theories of neuropsychology may lie in \\"modular psychiatry\\". The concept is that a modular understanding of the brain and advanced neuro-imaging techniques will allow for a more empirical diagnosis of mental and emotional disorders. There has been some work done towards this extension of the modularity theory with regards to the physical neurological differences in subjects with depression and schizophrenia, for example. Zielasek and Gaeble have set out a list of requirements in the field of neuropsychology in order to move towards neuropsychiatry: # To assemble a complete overview of putative modules of the human mind # To establish module-specific diagnostic tests (specificity, sensitivity, reliability) # To assess how far individual modules, sets of modules or their connections are affected in certain psychopathological situations # To probe novel module-specific therapies like the facial affect recognition training or to retrain access to context information in the case of delusions and hallucinations, in which \\"hyper-modularity\\" may play a role Zielasek, J., Gaeble W. (2008) Modern modularity and the road towards modular psychiatry. Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 258, 60‚Äì65. Research in the study of brain function can also be applied to cognitive behaviour therapy. As therapy becomes increasingly refined, it is important to differentiate cognitive processes in order to discover their relevance towards different patient treatments. An example comes specifically from studies on lateral specialization between the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The functional specialization of these hemispheres are offering insight on different forms of cognitive behaviour therapy methods, one focusing on verbal cognition (the main function of the left hemisphere) and the other emphasizing imagery or spatial cognition (the main function of the right hemisphere).Tucker, D.M., Shearer, S.L., and Murray, J.D. (1977). Hemispheric Specialization and Cognitive Behavior Therapy. Cognitive Therapy and Research, VoL 1, pp. 263‚Äì273 Examples of therapies that involve imagery, requiring right hemisphere activity in the brain, include systematic desensitizationGoldfried, M. R. Systematic desensitization as training in self-control. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 1971, 37, 228‚Äì234. and anxiety management training.Suinn, R. M., & Richardson, F. Anxiety management training: A nonspecific behavior therapy program for anxiety control. Behavior Therapy, 1971, 2, 498‚Äì510 Both of these therapy techniques rely on the patient's ability to use visual imagery to cope with or replace patients symptoms, such as anxiety. Examples of cognitive behaviour therapies that involve verbal cognition, requiring left hemisphere activity in the brain, include self- instructional training and stress inoculation.Novaco, R. W. (1977). Stress inoculation: A cognitive therapy for anger and its application to a case of depression. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Vol 45(4), 600‚Äì608. Both of these therapy techniques focus on patients' internal self-statements, requiring them to use vocal cognition. When deciding which cognitive therapy to employ, it is important to consider the primary cognitive style of the patient. Many individuals have a tendency to prefer visual imagery over verbalization and vice versa. One way of figuring out which hemisphere a patient favours is by observing their lateral eye movements. Studies suggest that eye gaze reflects the activation of cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the direction. Thus, when asking questions that require spatial thinking, individuals tend to move their eyes to the left, whereas when asked questions that require verbal thinking, individuals usually move their eyes to the right.Kocel, K., Galin, D., Ornstein, R., & Merrin, E. L. Lateral eye movements and cognitive mode. Psychonomic Science, 1972, 27, 223‚Äì224. In conclusion, this information allows one to choose the optimal cognitive behaviour therapeutic technique, thereby enhancing the treatment of many patients. = Areas representing modularity in the brain = Fusiform face area One of the most well known examples of functional specialization is the fusiform face area (FFA). Justine Sergent was one of the first researchers that brought forth evidence towards the functional neuroanatomy of face processing. Using positron emission tomography (PET), Sergent found that there were different patterns of activation in response to the two different required tasks, face processing verses object processing.Sergent, J., Signoret, J.L. (1992) Functional and anatomical decomposition of face processing: evidence from prosopagnosia and PET study of normal subject. The Royal Society. 335, 55‚Äì62 These results can be linked with her studies of brain-damaged patients with lesions in the occipital and temporal lobes. Patients revealed that there was an impairment of face processing but no difficulty recognizing everyday objects, a disorder also known as prosopagnosia. Later research by Nancy Kanwisher using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), found specifically that the region of the inferior temporal cortex, known as the fusiform gyrus, was significantly more active when subjects viewed, recognized and categorized faces in comparison to other regions of the brain. Lesion studies also supported this finding where patients were able to recognize objects but unable to recognize faces. This provided evidence towards domain specificity in the visual system, as Kanwisher acknowledges the Fusiform Face Area as a module in the brain, specifically the extrastriate cortex, that is specialized for face perception.Kanwisher, N., McDermott, J., Chun, M. (1997). The Fusiform Face Area: A Module in Human Extrastriate Cortex Specialized for Face Perception. The Journal of Neuroscience, 17(11):4302‚Äì4311 Visual area V4 and V5 While looking at the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using PET, researcher Semir Zeki directly demonstrated functional specialization within the visual cortex known as visual modularity. He localized regions involved specifically in the perception of colour and vision motion. For colour, visual area V4 was located when subjects were shown two identical displays, one being multicoloured and the other shades of grey.Zeki, S., et al. (1991). A direct demonstration of functional specialization in human visual cortex. United Kingdom, London. Journal of Neuroscience, Vol 11, 641‚Äì649 This was further supported from lesion studies where individuals were unable to see colours after damage, a disorder known as achromatopsia.Pearlman AL, Birch J, Meadows JC (1979) Cerebral color blindness: an acquired defect in hue discrimination. Ann Neurol 5:253‚Äì261. Combining PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), subjects viewing a moving checker board pattern verses a stationary checker board pattern located visual area V5, which is now considered to be specialized for vision motion. (Watson et al., 1993) This area of functional specialization was also supported by lesion study patients who's damage caused cerebral motion blindness.Zihl J, von Cramon D, Mai N (1983) Selective disturbance of movement vision after bilateral brain damage. Brain 106:3 13‚Äì340. Frontal lobes Studies have found the frontal lobes to be involved in the executive functions of the brain, which are higher level cognitive processes.Duncan, J., & Owen, A. (2000). Common regions of the human frontal lobe recruited by diverse cognitive demands. Elsevier Science. This control process is involved in the coordination, planning and organizing of actions towards an individual's goals. It contributes to such things as one's behaviour, language and reasoning. More specifically, it was found to be the function of the prefrontal cortex,Fuster, J. (2008). The Prefrontal Cortex. Elsevier. (pg 178‚Äì353) and evidence suggest that these executive functions control processes such as planning and decision making, error correction and assisting overcoming habitual responses. Miller and Cummings used PET and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) to further support functional specialization of the frontal cortex. They found lateralization of verbal working memory in the left frontal cortex and visuospatial working memory in the right frontal cortex. Lesion studies support these findings where left frontal lobe patients exhibited problems in controlling executive functions such as creating strategies.Miller, B., Cummings, J. (2007) The Human Frontal Lobes: Functions and Disorders. The Guilford Press, New York and London.(pg 68‚Äì77) The dorsolateral, ventrolateral and anterior cingulate regions within the prefrontal cortex are proposed to work together in different cognitive tasks, which is related to interaction theories. However, there has also been evidence suggesting strong individual specializations within this network. For instance, Miller and Cummings found that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is specifically involved in the manipulation and monitoring of sensorimotor information within working memory. Right and left hemispheres During the 1960s, Roger Sperry conducted a natural experiment on epileptic patients who had previously had their corpora callosa cut. The corpus callosum is the area of the brain dedicated to linking both the right and left hemisphere together. Sperry et al.'s experiment was based on flashing images in the right and left visual fields of his participants. Because the participant's corpus callosum was cut, the information processed by each visual field could not be transmitted to the other hemisphere. In one experiment, Sperry flashed images in the right visual field (RVF), which would subsequently be transmitted to the left hemisphere (LH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were fully capable of remembering the image flashed. However, when the participants were then asked to draw what they had seen, they were unable to. When Sperry et al. flashed images in the left visual field (LVF), the information processed would be sent to the right hemisphere (RH) of the brain. When asked to repeat what they had previously seen, participants were unable to recall the image flashed, but were very successful in drawing the image. Therefore, Sperry concluded that the left hemisphere of the brain was dedicated to language as the participants could clearly speak the image flashed. On the other hand, Sperry concluded that the right hemisphere of the brain was involved in more creative activities such as drawing.\\"The Split Brain Experiments\\". Nobelprize.org. 4 Oct 2011 http://www.nobelprize.org/educational/medicine/split-brain/background.html Parahippocampal place area Located in the parahippocampal gyrus, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) was coined by Nancy Kanwisher and Russell Epstein after an fMRI study showed that the PPA responds optimally to scenes presented containing a spatial layout, minimally to single objects and not at all to faces.Epstien, R., & Kanwisher, N. (1998). A cortical representation of the local visual environment. Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Amherst Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was also noted in this experiment that activity remains the same in the PPA when viewing a scene with an empty room or a room filled with meaningful objects. Kanwisher and Epstein proposed \\"that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment\\". In addition, Soojin Park and Marvin Chun posited that activation in the PPA is viewpoint specific, and so responds to changes in the angle of the scene. In contrast, another special mapping area, the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), is viewpoint invariant or does not change response levels when views change.Park, S., Chun, M. (2009) Different roles of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC)in panoramic scene perception. NeuroImage 47, 1747‚Äì1756. This perhaps indicates a complementary arrangement of functionally and anatomically separate visual processing brain areas. Extrastriate body area Located in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex, fMRI studies have shown the extrastriate body area (EBA) to have selective responding when subjects see human bodies or body parts, implying that it has functional specialization. The EBA does not optimally respond to objects or parts of objects but to human bodies and body parts, a hand for example. In fMRI experiments conducted by Downing et al. participants were asked to look at a series of pictures. These stimuli includes objects, parts of objects (for example just the head of a hammer), figures of the human body in all sorts of positions and types of detail (including line drawings or stick men), and body parts (hands or feet) without any body attached. There was significantly more blood flow (and thus activation) to human bodies, no matter how detailed, and body parts than to objects or object parts.Downing, P., Jiang, Y., Shuman, M., Kanwisher, N. (2001) A cortical area selective for visual processing of the human body. Science, 293.  Distributive processing  The cognitive theory of distributed processing suggests that brain areas are highly interconnected and process information in a distributed manner. A remarkable precedent of this orientation is the research of Justo Gonzalo on brain dynamics Gonzalo, J. (1945, 1950, 1952, 2010). Din√°mica Cerebral. Facsimil edition of Volumen I 1945 and Volumen II 1950 (Madrid: Inst. S. Ram√≥n y Cajal, CSIC), Suplemento I 1952 (Trab. Inst. Cajal Invest. Biol.), first ed. Suplemento II 2010.

For a recent review in English see this article (Open Access) .English translation of Article of 1952 and Indexes of Vol. I (1945) and Vol. II (1950), Open Access. where several phenomena that he observed could not be explained by the traditional theory of localizations. From the gradation he observed between different syndromes in patients with different cortical lesions, this author proposed in 1952 a functional gradients model,Gonzalo, J. (1952). \\"Las funciones cerebrales humanas seg√∫n nuevos datos y bases fisiol√≥gicas. Una introducci√≥n a los estudios de Din√°mica Cerebral\\". Trabajos del Inst. Cajal de Investigaciones Biol√≥gicas XLIV: pp. 95‚Äì157. Complete English translation, Open Access. which permits an ordering and an interpretation of multiple phenomena and syndromes. The functional gradients are continuous functions through the cortex describing a distributed specificity, so that, for a given sensory system, the specific gradient, of contralateral character, is maximum in the corresponding projection area and decreases in gradation towards more \\"central\\" zone and beyond so that the final decline reaches other primary areas. As a consequence of the crossing and overlapping of the specific gradients, in the central zone where the overlap is greater, there would be an action of mutual integration, rather nonspecific (or multisensory) with bilateral character due to the corpus callosum. This action would be maximum in the central zone and minimal towards the projection areas. As the author stated (p. 20 of the English translation) \\"a functional continuity with regional variation is then offered, each point of the cortex acquiring different properties but with certain unity with the rest of the cortex. It is a dynamic conception of quantitative localizations\\". A very similar gradients scheme was proposed by Elkhonon Goldberg in 1989 Goldberg, E. (1989). \\"Gradiental approach to neocortical functional organization\\". J. Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology 11 489-517. Other researchers who provide evidence to support the theory of distributive processing include Anthony McIntosh and William Uttal, who question and debate localization and modality specialization within the brain. McIntosh's research suggests that human cognition involves interactions between the brain regions responsible for processes sensory information, such as vision, audition, and other mediating areas like the prefrontal cortex. McIntosh explains that modularity is mainly observed in sensory and motor systems, however, beyond these very receptors, modularity becomes \\"fuzzier\\" and you see the cross connections between systems increase.McIntosh, A. R. (1999). Mapping Cognition to the Brain Through Neural Interactions. University of Toronto, Canada. Psychology Press, 523‚Äì548 He also illustrates that there is an overlapping of functional characteristics between the sensory and motor systems, where these regions are close to one another. These different neural interactions influence each other, where activity changes in one area influence other connected areas. With this, McIntosh suggest that if you only focus on activity in one area, you may miss the changes in other integrative areas. Neural interactions can be measured using analysis of covariance in neuroimaging. McIntosh used this analysis to convey a clear example of the interaction theory of distributive processing. In this study, subjects learned that an auditory stimulus signalled a visual event. McIntosh found activation (an increase blood flow), in an area of the occipital cortex, a region of the brain involved in visual processing,Zeki, S. (1993). A vision of the brain. Cambridge, MA, US: Blackwell Scientific Publications. when the auditory stimulus was presented alone. Correlations between the occipital cortex and different areas of the brain such as the prefrontal cortex, premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex showed a pattern of co-variation and functional connectivity.McIntosh, A. R., Cabeza, R. E., and Lobaugh, N., J. (1998). Analysis of Neural Interactions Explains the Activation of Occipital Cortex by an Auditory Stimulus. The Journal of Neurophysiology Vol. 80 No. 5, pp. 2790‚Äì2796 Uttal focusses on the limits of localizing cognitive processes in the brain. One of his main arguments is that since the late 1990s, research in cognitive neuroscience has forgotten about conventional psychophysical studies based on behavioural observation. He believes that current research focusses on the technological advances of brain imaging techniques such as MRI and PET scans. Thus, he further suggest that this research is dependent on the assumptions of localization and hypothetical cognitive modules that use such imaging techniques to pursuit these assumptions. Uttal's major concern incorporates many controversies with the validly, over-assumptions and strong inferences some of these images are trying to illustrate. For instance, there is concern over the proper utilization of control images in an experiment. Most of the cerebrum is active during cognitive activity, therefore the amount of increased activity in a region must be greater when compared to a controlled area. In general, this may produce false or exaggerated findings and may increase potential tendency to ignore regions of diminished activity which may be crucial to the particular cognitive process being studied.Uttal, W. R. (2002). Pr√©cis of The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain. Department of Industrial Engineering, Arizona State University, USA. Moreover, Uttal believes that localization researchers tend to ignore the complexity of the nervous system. Many regions in the brain are physically interconnected in a nonlinear system, hence, Uttal believes that behaviour is produced by a variety of system organizations. Collaboration The two theories, modularity and distributive processing, can also be combined. By operating simultaneously, these principles may interact with each other in a collaborative effort to characterize the functioning of the brain. Fodor himself, one of the major contributors to the modularity theory, appears to have this sentiment. He noted that modularity is a matter of degrees, and that the brain is modular to the extent that it warrants studying it in regards to its functional specialization. Although there are areas in the brain that are more specialized for cognitive processes than others, the nervous system also integrates and connects the information produced in these regions. In fact, the proposed distributive scheme of the functional cortical gradientes by J. Gonzalo already tries to join both concepts modular and distributive: regional heterogeneity should be a definitive acquisition (maximum specificity in the projection paths and primary areas), but the rigid separation between projection and association areas would be erased through the continuous functions of gradient. The collaboration between the two theories not only would provide a more unified perception and understanding of the world but also make available the ability to learn from it.

Background INTAN was established in 1959 as the 'Training Centre for Civil Servants', which was situated in Port Dickson. The prime objective of the centre was to train civil servants with the necessary knowledge and expertise to face the development challenges of the nation, especially after Independence. In 1963, the Training Centre was relocated to Jalan Ilmu, Petaling Jaya, close to the University of Malaya. In 1972, the training centre was officially upgraded to an Institute, and is officially known as Institut Tadbiran Awam Negara (INTAN). This change in status coincided with the centre's increasing role and responsibilities under the National Economic Policy (NEP 1971-1990), aimed at socioeconomic development and eradicating poverty in this fledgling nation. INTAN with the cooperation of the Public Services Department, have played pivotal roles in not only providing civil servants with the necessary facilities and training, but also scholarships, allowances, grants, and so on, for further education and career advancement (Jeong, 2007). Organisation INTAN is headed by a Director General, and assists by eight Deputy Directors. Each of the Deputy Director headed a Center. Essentially, there are eight (8) centers under INTAN: #Quality Management #Financial Management #Economic Development and Policy Management #Senior Management and Executive Development #Case Studies Development and Multi-media #Knowledge and Graduate Studies #Information Technology #Language These eight centers contributed positively to the relevancy of INTAN as a modern-day training center of the government, in providing the staff with the necessary knowledge, skills and expertise, in fulfilling their roles as practical public servants. Furthermore, courses in INTAN can comprise short-period courses, such as Computer Competency courses (MS Word, Excel, Excess, Basic Internet skills, and so on), to long-term courses, such as Diploma in Public Administration, Diploma in Strategic Studies, Diploma in Foreign Policy, and other short or long courses. Other courses and trainings are provided in areas such as (Jeong, 2007): *Management *Social Development *Policy Development *Agricultural Development *Province and Town Development *Land Administration *Local Government Administration *International Relations *International Trade and Economy *Defense and Security *Office Administration Seminars, conferences, and workshops are also held from time to time, to update civil servants, which includes top civil officers, with the necessary knowledge, skills, and expertise, and also as a medium to exchange knowledge and expertise, to face the challenges and needs of modern public administration.

The Act makes provision about police reform, prostitution, sex offenders, sex establishments and certain other premises. It amends the law on aviation security, misuse, proceeds of crime, extradition and gang related violence. The legislation came about due to a number of recommendations in government reports seeking an increase in public accountability. This led to a green paper about policing in which ways in which policing could be improved were discussed, which in turn led to the creation of the Policing Pledge. This then became a Government Bill and was introduced to the House of Commons on 18 December 2008, passing to the House of Lords on 20 May 2009, gaining Royal Assent and becoming law on 12 November 2009. The Act has received a mixed reception, with improved police accountability being praised and the changes to sexual entertainment licenses and prostitution being criticised by senior members of the Police Service as well as other interested parties. There were initially proposals that the Act would allow the public to elect crime and policing representatives to run their local police service, but these plans were removed from the bill before it was laid before the house. Nevertheless, the Act still requires police authorities to have regard for the views of people in the police area.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 1 (duty of police authorities in relation to public accountability) The election of crime and policing representatives was subsequently introduced in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, which established Police and Crime Commissioners. Background The Act emanated from a number of recommendations in government reports on police reform and jurisdiction, and on engaging local communities in fighting crime and holding their local police service to account. When it was proposed in the Queen's Speech in 2008, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) President Ken Jones said \\"We welcome the Government‚Äôs continued commitment to assist the police service in tackling crime and anti-social behaviour and to strengthen our ability to protect our ports and borders.\\" The Government initially planned to allow the local community to elect crime and policing representatives to run their police service. The Local Government Association (LGA), ACPO and the Association of Police Authorities (APA) criticised this plan, warning it would lead to heavier bureaucratic burdens on councils, increased political control on policing and would create a barrier to women and people from minority ethnic backgrounds getting involved. The APA also stated there was a \\"very real danger of extremists and single issue pressure groups targeting these elections for their own ends\\". This plan was later dropped amid fears that the police could become politicised. It was also announced there would be a ban on cheap alcohol promotions. Jacqui Smith told BBC News that she did not want to stop \\"the vast majority of people who enjoy alcohol and drink responsibly from doing so\\" but that \\"[w]e all face a cost from alcohol-related disorder and I have a duty to crack down on irresponsible promotions that can fuel excessive drinking and lead people into crime and disorder.\\" Green paper The Policing green paper was published on 17 July 2008 and titled 'From the neighbourhood to the national: policing our communities together'. In this green paper it discussed a number of areas where policing in the UK could be improved, based on the review that Sir Ronnie Flanagan had undertaken. These areas were: * Citizen Focus, leading to the national Policing Pledge that police forces would have to take. * Reducing bureaucracy and developing technology for police officers. * Defining roles and leadership within the police service, focusing on development and deployment. * Reinforcing collaboration between forces. * Improving performance and effectiveness in policing. Bill Jacqui Smith introduced the bill into the House of Commons The Policing and Crime Bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 18 December 2008 and was passed to the House of Lords on 20 May 2009. During its passage in the House of Lords a number of amendments were proposed and agreed to. Among the amendments were that \\"it would now be an offence for a person to pay for sex with a prostitute if a third person had engaged in exploitative conduct of a kind likely to induce or encourage the prostitute to provide the sexual services. Exploitative conduct would mean the use of force, threats (whether or not relating to violence) or any other form of coercion or deception\\", that \\"sex encounter venues\\" be renamed \\"sexual entertainment venues\\" in the case of lap dancing clubs and that the provisions which allowed licensing authorities to impose discretionary licensing conditions on two or more premises were removed. On 12 November 2009 the Act went through the Consideration of Lords/Commons amendments stage and was given Royal Assent on the same day. Police reform The Police Service is reformed by adding a number of amendments to the Police Act 1996, which require police forces to have regard to the views of people in their area about policing in that area. It creates a Police Senior Appointments Panel which has authority regarding the appointment of senior police officers. It creates a legal framework to allow two or more police forces to collaborate and make agreements in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency, for payment or otherwise. The Act also amended the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to allow for the collaboration agreements that are created under this Act. Sexual offences Prostitution The Act also amends the law on loitering for the purposes of prostitution and also amends the law on soliciting. It removes the term \\"common prostitute\\" and introduces Engagement and Support Orders. These require a person involved in prostitution to attend meetings to investigate the ‚Äúcauses of their offending behaviour‚Äù with the aim of helping them find a route out of prostitution. The Act also makes it illegal to pay for services from a prostitute whom a third person has subjected to force, threats, coercion or deception to perform those services. It is irrelevant whether the customer knew or could have known about this exploitation. The country where the sexual services are provided is also irrelevant. When the changes were first announced by the Home Office, Dr Timothy Brain, Gloucestershire Chief Constable and ACPO Lead on Prostitution and Vice Matters praised the new measures, saying that \\"With these proposals the Government has clearly signalled its intention to bring about a sea change in attitudes towards prostitution.\\" Other amendments The Act amended the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to introduce closure orders on brothels,The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 21 (closure orders) prevent time limits of complaints and make sexual offenders surrender their passports.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 22 (closure orders) The Act also amended the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 (c. 30) (control of sex establishments) to reclassify lap-dancing clubs as 'sexual entertainment venues' instead of 'entertainment venues',The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 27 (regulation of lap dancing and other sexual entertainment venues etc) thus allowing the Government to tighten up regulation. Alcohol misuse and gang-related violence There are a number of changes regarding the way that the police deal with alcohol misuse. The Act amends the power that the police have under section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 to require a person aged 16 years or over to leave a public place, to a person aged 10 years or older.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 31 (directions to individuals who represent a risk of disorder) This amendment also allows police officers to take a person under the age of sixteen home, or to a place of safety, if they are issued with a direction to leave under section 27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006.The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006, section 4A (directions to individuals who represent a risk of disorder) When these new powers were introduced on 29 January 2010, they were described as helping \\"officers to take a more robust approach and will hopefully reassure residents that we are continuing to target this issue.\\" The Act deems it an offence for a person aged under 18 years to be in possession of alcohol in a relevant place without reasonable excuse, on 3 or more occasions, within 12 consecutive months.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 30 (offence of persistently possessing alcohol in a public place) It also introduces a new mandatory code of practice for alcohol sales. This part of the Act is applicable only to England and Wales and Northern Ireland.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 115 (extent) The police and local authorities are now able to apply for injunctions to prevent gang related violence.The Policing and Crime Act 2009, section 34 (injunctions to prevent gang-related violence) In October 2011, Gloucestershire Constabulary in partnership with Gloucester City Council successfully applied for gang injunctions against two local men who had been involved in persistent criminal and anti social behaviour. Further amendments This Act introduced a number of amendments as follows: * the criminal asset recovery scheme which was established under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; * the Extradition Act 2003, and; * the Aviation Security Act 1982 to provide security planning and risk assessments for aerodromes. The Act also deals with the policing of airports. Reception The Act has received a mixed reception during the passage of the bill, with much criticism about the parts of it which deal with prostitution coming from senior police officers, such as Commander Alan Gibson, head of the Metropolitan Police's anti- trafficking unit, who argued that the law with regards to criminalising men who pay for sex with prostitutes would be \\"very difficult to enforce\\". The Chief Constable for Gloucestershire Constabulary, Dr Tim Brain, told BBC News that he feared the complexity of the law may make gaining evidence hard. There was also criticism from the English Collective of Prostitutes, who said that the Act will force prostitution further underground and prevent women from reporting violence and accessing health or other services. ACPO commented on the bill, saying that \\"chief officers will welcome the introduction of powers to impose mandatory conditions on the supply of alcohol\\", and \\"includes other measures we welcome, such as those to close brothels and give police powers to protect neighbourhoods from the nuisance and harm they create; and strengthened legislation to support police operations to recover the proceeds of crime.\\" There has been much praise with the increased accountability that is introduced with the passing of the Act with the LGA stating they supported \\"the core principles behind the Bill of empowering local people by giving them a stronger voice in police decision-making, and greater freedoms and discretion for the police to concentrate on local policing priorities.\\" and the APA saying they welcomed \\"the government‚Äôs recognition of the valuable role of police authorities in holding police to account on behalf of local people.\\" The Lap Dancing Association opposed reclassifying lap-dancing clubs as \\"sexual entertainment venues\\" instead of \\"entertainment venues\\", and introducing a licensing system for clubs which allowed local authorities to decide the number and location of lap-dancing clubs in their area. Chris Knight, vice-chairman of the LDA, said that the cost of the additional licence required to run a lap dancing club from 2010 could affect many businesses and questioned the right of local authorities to make licensing decisions on \\"emotive and moralistic grounds\\". Peter Stringfellow criticised the powers to control lap-dancing clubs, saying the change was \\"unnecessary\\" and that he would be appealing to the European Court of Human Rights if his club licences were not renewed.  Fall in number of sex establishments in England  In February 2018 it was reported that the number of sex establishments in England had fallen by a third. A freedom of information request by the BBC revealed that between 2013 and 2018 the number of sex establishments licences issued by councils in England had dropped from 386 to 256. ;Decline in sex establishment licences in England ‚Äì active licences issued by local authorities See also *Prostitution in the United Kingdom References External links Reports * Policing Green Paper (PDF) * Policing and Crime Bill: Lords Amendments (PDF) * Independent Review of Policing by Sir Ronnie Flanagan * Policing and Crime Act 2009 - Explanatory Notes - The National Archive United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 2009 Prostitution law in the United Kingdom ","title":"Policing and Crime Act 2009"},{"id":"25146551","text":"The National Management College (NSC) is located at Islamabad, Pakistan and is a constituent unit of National School of Public Policy (NSPP).

They were the brainchild of John \\"Jocko\\" Moffitt, a roofer and drummer. He had heard about a number of folk festivals in his native California, and he wanted to stage a rock festival in a country setting. Planning for the event began in 1966 and by the early spring of 1967 performers like Richie Havens were being tentatively booked. The first festival was sited at Pan Copeland's farm outside Woodstock‚Äîjust south of Route 212 on Glasco Turnpike. The festival featured over twenty music acts including Richie Havens, Tim Hardin, Billy Batson, Kenny Rankin and Phil Ochs. Two thousand people attended the three-day event and the outdoor concert itself came together so quickly that the greater community was largely unaware that it had taken place. Moffitt co-promoted the event with Steve Bishop.1,2  1968  Copeland and Moffitt soon had a falling out. However, Moffitt promoted one final Sound-Out at the Woodstock Playhouse in March 1968. Richie Havens was once again on the bill and such other performers as Jerry Moore, Don Preston, Major Wiley and Bunky and Jake also performed.3 Pan Copeland resurrected the festival on her farm that summer and called it the Woodstock Sound Festival. She brought in people including Julius Bruggeman, James Matteson, Jackson C. Frank and others to help promote and run the festivals.4 Sound festivals occurred over the July 4th weekend in 1968, with Tim Hardin, Major Wiley, the Blues Magoos, Chrysalis and Happy & Artie Traum appearing.5 Later that month another mini-festival happened on July 19 and 20. Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys headlined, joined by such other performers as Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Batson, Happy & Artie Traum, Lothar and the Hand People, Raven, and Soft Machine. In August two more shows were staged. On August 16 and 17 the Colwell-Winfield Blues Band, Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys, Fear Itself, Don McLean, Rebecca & Sunny Brook Farmers, The Sanjac of Novipazar and Tim Hardin were on the bill.6 By this time Bob Fass, host of WBAI's Radio Unnameable, was emceeing and promoting the festivals via the Pacifica airwaves. Over the weekend of August 30, 31 and September 1 the Colwell-Winfield Blues Band, Frank Wakefield, Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys, Peter Walker, Procol Harum, Scott Fagan and others performed. The Pablo Light Show was present at the July 19 and 20 show, the Pentacle Light Show was scheduled for August 16 and 17 and the Rose Window Light Show for the late August event. Each of these concerts drew from 500 to 1,000 attendees.  1969  According to Michael Lang, legendary promoter of the Woodstock Festival of 1969, \\"the Sound-Outs were kind of the spark for the Woodstock festival. The Sound-Outs just had a great feel, and it was in the country and it provided all the guidelines that I needed, and I was sort of thinking of a broader event but with the same kind of emotional impact.\\"7 By 1969 the Woodstock Sound Festivals were under the direction of Cyril Caster. An ambitious schedule of eight events was planned, but due to inclement weather only one was successfully staged. Performers like Paul Butterfield, Tim Hardin, Happy & Artie Traum, Van Morrison, Children of God, and the Colwell- Winfield Blues Band played at the event that summer.8  1970  The following year Ian Hain became president of Woodstock Sound Festival Inc. Working with Pan Copeland, he prepared a schedule of weekly concerts beginning on July 4. After the Woodstock Music & Art Fair at Bethel, the town of Saugerties (within whose boundaries the Sound-Outs had been held) placed on the books a set of laws that prevented promoters from organizing an assemblage of more than 200 without a permit. The acts in 1970 included The Flying Burrito Brothers, Ian and Sylvia and the Great Speckled Bird, Larry Coryell, Ellen McIlwaine, Procol Harum and Holy Moses. Hain was successful in staging a three-day event over the July 4th weekend. However, due to legal pressure the concert for the July 25 weekend was reduced to one day. Hain was arrested on July 25 when attendees surpassed the allowed limit and reached 210.9 He fought his case through the courts, and by September 9 the case was dismissed, but the season was over.10  2008  The Sound-Outs at Pan Copeland‚Äôs fields ended, but the idea lived on and was resurrected in 2008. In that year on August 9 a contemporary Sound- Out was held‚Äîin conjunction with Roots of the 1969 Woodstock Festival Backstory Panel Discussion‚Äîat the Colony Caf√© in Woodstock, NY. The following acts performed: Hair of the Dog, Peter Walker, Spiv, Jeremy Bernstein, Steve Knight, Joey Eppard, Frankie and his Fingers, Norman Wennet, Mighty Xee, Marian Tortorella, Paul McMahon, Dharma Bums, Tim Moore, Justin Love, Lynn Miller and Sredni Vollmer, Naked and Nathaniel.11  2009  For the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival, a Roots of Woodstock Live Concert took place at the Bearsville Theater in Woodstock on August 15, 2009. At this concert several of the old Sound-Out bands were re-united for the first time since the 1960s. Performing that night were the Blues Magoos, Hubert Sumlin and band, Ellen McIlwaine, Marc Black, the Robbie Turner Band, and Jerry Moore with the Children of God. Blues hall of famer Hubert Sumlin had been invited to perform in a nod to Sound-Out alumni Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry. Woodstock troubadour Marc Black had been strongly influenced by the music of original Sound-Out performer Tim Hardin. Robbie Turner, who had attended the sixties Sound-Outs, played on stage this time around.12,13  References  1\\\\. ‚ÄúHippy Festival Upstate Is Cool Amid the Bonfires,‚Äù The New York Times, (September 3, 1967), 22.2\\\\. ‚ÄúSound-Out,‚Äù The Woodstock Week, (September 7, 1967), 1.3\\\\. ‚ÄúGround-Out,‚Äù The Woodstock Week, (April 3, 1968), 1.4\\\\.

It is also featured in several works of popular culture. According to legend, the seven cities of gold could be found throughout the pueblos of the New Mexico Territory. Names associated with lost cities of gold include: El Dorado, Paititi, City of the Caesars, Lake Parime at Manoa, Antilia, Quivira and Cibola. Origins of myth In the 16th century, the Spaniards in New Spain (now Mexico) began to hear rumors of \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" called \\"C√≠bola\\" located across the desert, hundreds of miles to the north. The stories may have their root in an earlier Portuguese legend about seven cities founded on the island of Antillia by a Catholic expedition in the 8th century, or one based on the capture of M√©rida, Spain by the Moors in 1150. The later Spanish tales were largely caused by reports given by the four shipwrecked survivors of the failed Narv√°ez expedition, which included √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca and a black moorish slave named Esteban Dorantes, or Estevanico. Eventually returning to New Spain, the adventurers said they had heard stories from natives about cities with great and limitless riches. However, when conquistador Francisco V√°zquez de Coronado finally arrived at C√≠bola in 1540, he discovered that the stories were unfounded and that there were, in fact, no treasures as the friar had described ‚Äî only adobe towns. While among the towns, Coronado heard an additional rumor from a native he called \\"the Turk\\" that there was a city with plenty of gold called Quivira located on the other side of the great plains. However, when at last he reached this place (variously conjectured to be in modern Kansas, Nebraska or Missouri), he found little more than straw-thatched villages. The historic Cibola on the other hand is recorded in Spanish sources as another name for the Zu√±i pueblo and the surrounding country. The Spanish soon discovered rich copper and turquoise mines in the Pueblo country which made the region famous for its mineral wealth even in recent times. The Pueblo Indians including the Zu√±i are still well known for their Turquoise and silver work. In popular culture  Music  *The song \\"Hitchinchilla' to Quivira\\" from independent singer-songwriter Tyler Jakes's 2016 album Mojo Suicide is based on the story of Coronado's expedition. *Seven Cities of Gold is the seventh track on the Clockwork Angels album by Rush. The lyrics were inspired by lyricist Neil Peart's fascination for southwestern US history.  Movies  *The 1955 film Seven Cities of Gold starring Richard Egan, Anthony Quinn, and Michael Rennie tells the story of a 1769 Spanish expedition to California led by Gaspar De Portola to search of gold and to set up Spanish colonies. However, Father Junipero Serra is there to set up a network of Roman Catholic missions. *The 1958 film The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels refers to the Seven Cities of Gold several times in this movie. The Lone Ranger and Tonto investigate the brutal murders of three Native Americans who each possessed a silver medallion. The silver medallions together created a treasure map giving the location of one of the Seven Cities of Gold. At the end of the movie, the Lone Ranger and Tonto do find the City of Gold in a cavern, but they turn it over to a doctor, a priest, and the local Native Americans so they can build a hospital. *The 1992 film ¬°O No Coronado! by Craig Baldwin details Coronado's ill-fated expedition, in the context of contemporary treatment of indigenous Americans and usage of their traditional lands. *C√≠bola was discovered beneath Mount Rushmore in National Treasure: Book of Secrets, a 2007 film starring Nicolas Cage and Diane Kruger.  Literature  *The novel The King's Fifth by Scott O'Dell tells the story of one such (fictional) expedition through the eyes of a teenage cartographer. *In the Stephen King book The Stand, Trashcan Man is instructed by Randall Flagg to meet him in Cibola, which is later revealed to be Las Vegas. *Edward Abbey's autobiographical recount of his summer as a park ranger at Arches National Park, Desert Solitaire, contains a reference to \\"seven modern cities of Cibola\\" including Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff. *Fiction romance author Kristin Hannah wrote: \\"The Enchantment\\" which is a story of the quest for the legendary lost city of Cibola in the late 1800s. (1992) *Cibola Burn is the fourth book in the science fiction novel series The Expanse by James S. A. Corey. The novel describes the flood of humanity out into the galaxy and the race for the newly accessible resources therein.  Television  *The book The King's Fifth in its turn loosely inspired the 1982 Japanese/French animated children's series The Mysterious Cities of Gold and its 2012 sequel, but with a science fiction twist: the cities were constructed by the empires of Mu and Atlantis. *The quest for Cibola was in an episode of the U.S. television series Daniel Boone with Fess Parker.

While most Persian carpets can be classified to a specific region corresponding to their weave, this is not the case with Bessarabian carpets and rugs. With these rugs, the weave only gives clues about the market it was created for (rural or urban); therefore, a normal classification is disregarded and the broader term, \\"Bessarabian\\", is applied.5 All works of the Bessarabian category are highly decorative. Not dissimilar to particular Karabaghs from the Caucasus, many of the designs crafted in Bessarabian carpets are floral in motif. The designs usually fit within a black or brown tone background, executed in a naturalistic western. Some pieces, in particular the flat-weaves, are woven with the distinctive Bessarabian palette in the tradition of kilim rugs from nearby Anatolia.6 References *2 3 5 Sherrill, Sarah B., Carpets and Rugs of Europe and America.

Aravindan. The serial cartoon was published in the last page of Malayalam weekly, Mathrubhumi from 1961 to 1973. right The cartoon dealt with the adventures of the central characters Ramu and Guruji, mingled with political and social satires. Characters in the cartoon literally depicted the socio-political and cultural issues of Kerala with a very special satiric touch. The series was preceded by two more cartoon series namely Ramuvinte Sahasika Yathrakal and Guruji featuring the central characters of Cheriya Manushyarum Valiya Lokavum. The strip split its readers into two equally enthusiastic categories: while many appreciated the strip for its thought provoking, understated, subtle kind of humour there were as many readers who derided it for not being \\"funny\\". The translated version of Walt Disney's \\"Funny Animals\\" was the only other cartoon that this Mathrubhumi carried at that time. A collected edition of these strips was first published by Bees Books in 1978 and subsequently by DC books in 1996.

The Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 17th Infantry Regiment fought against Korean People's Army (KPA) 14th Infantry Regiment and the 3rd Guards Brigade supported by a tank company at Ongjin.  Order of battle   Democratic People's Republic of Korea  *14th Infantry Regiment - Senior Colonel Han Il-rae *3rd Guard Brigade - Brigadier General Choe Hyun  Republic of Korea  *17th Infantry Regiment - Colonel Paik In- yup  1st Infantry Battalion - Major Kim Hee-tae  2nd Infantry Battalion - Major Song Ho-rim  3rd Infantry Battalion - Major Oh Ik-kyung  7th Artillery Battalion - Major Park Yeon-ho  Regional characteristics  Ongjin Peninsula is located at the westernmost of the 38th Parallel. It is surrounded by the sea, and its only land route was through North Korean territory. There are strategic mountains at the center of the peninsula that can observe the entire peninsula easily. Prior to the Battle of Ongjin, the two opposing forces already had three clashes near these mountains in 1949. The KPA had built supply bases nearby, and supplies could be transported by railroad. On the other hand, ROK forces received support from Port Bupho located at the southeast of the peninsula. Due to the wide range between tidelines, large vessels were only able to come up alongside the Port Bupho pier twice per day.  Prelude  From 20 June 1950, ROK 17th Infantry Regiment began witnessing suspicious and unusual movements on the North Korean side of the 38th Parallel. The regiment spotted many high-ranking North Korean officers in North Korean bases and on the hills, but no North Korean civilians were seen. When the regiment received an order to call off its alert, regimental commander Paik In-yup ignored the order and kept his regiment on high alert for any possible attacks from North Korea. Eventually, Paik lowered the alert except on the front lines. However, when United Nations personnel visited the regiment they urged Paik to cancel the alert saying that it would cause the very issue it was in place to prevent. However, the day before the battle Paik ordered all troops to be stationed in their defense positions, giving the regiment a battle-ready stance for the upcoming attack.  Preparation   Democratic People's Republic of Korea  Taking over Kangryong as fast as possible was the main goal for North Korean forces. The 3rd Guards Brigade prepared in the west, and the 14th Infantry Regiment with an armored battalion from the 203th Armored Regiment was tasked with capturing Kangryong.  Republic of Korea  The 17th Infantry Regiment had to defend a 45 km line with limited troops. The 1st Infantry Battalion covered the west and the 3rd Infantry Battalion covered the east while the 2nd Infantry Battalion was stationed at the rear to act as relief. The regiment focused its strength at the Kangryong, protected by the 3rd Infantry Battalion, because it was most likely to be the primary object for North Korea. If Kangryong was taken, the regiment would lose its combat strength by half along with its path of retreat.  Battle  At 04:00 on 25 June a red flare was shot in the air and KPA forces began shelling ROK defenses for 30 minutes. After the artillery attack, a battalion-sized KPA force thrust into the ROK 1st Battalion. Two companies of the battalion fought hand-to-hand, but were forced to retreat due to KPA reinforcement. With the destruction of both wire and wireless communications, 1st Battalion commander Major Kim learned of the situation from retreating forces. He sent a reserve company forward, but this effort failed. Major Kim was later killed by KPA artillery. Meantime, the KPA 14th Regiment continued shelling on the ROK 3rd Battalion until 05:30. However, ROK forces was not allowed to return artillery fire until hours later because the U.S. advisors had full control over the battalion's 105mm artillery. When KPA forces attacked the ROK defenses with tanks and armored vehicles, ROK forces employed M18 recoilless rifle in defense. These failed to destroy any tanks. The ROK 3rd Battalion then retreated and set up new defensive lines at Chimasan and Seokgyeri which left Kangryong and Yangwon vulnerable to KPA attack. Nevertheless, Colonel Paik ordered the 2nd Battalion to aid the 1st Battalion to maintain defense line on the left. The 2nd Battalion ambushed and annihilated a KPA battalion then recovered the left of the line in a counterattack. The battalion then received orders to retreat, but refused and maintained the defensive line until the battalion learned the regiment had withdrawn to Kangryong. The battalion commander Major Song led both the 1st and 2nd Battalions to Buldangsan. When the troops arrived at Buldangsan, the KPA forces had already taken over Yangwon and Kangryong. Major Song abandon plans to move to Port Bupho. Instead, he moved his forces to Sagot and retreated from there. After retreating from Kangryong, the 3rd Battalion made its final defensive line and engineers blasted bridges to halt KPA tanks. However, the DPRK forces did not chase down the ROK troops. Later it was learned that the KPA 14th Regiment transferred the operation to the 3rd Guards Brigade after taking over Kangryong and moved to a different area to join larger battles. LST-801 came to Port Bupho at 23:30 and most of the 3rd Battalion boarded. Heavy equipment and supplies except one M101 howitzer were either destroyed or thrown into the sea. Colonel Paik ordered LST-801 to set sail. He remained with the 7th Artillery Battalion, where he worked with its commander, Major Park, and other officers till the last round was fired. They successfully fled the zone in a small wooden boat.  Aftermath  About 90% of the South Korean forces and equipment in Ongjin Peninsula was evacuated to the mainland. The 17th Infantry Regiment moved to Daejeon and recovered all losses. The regiment returned to the front line at Osan and participated in later battles including the Battle of Inchon.

Stockton's full entry runs from 4:237‚Äì244 Biography Stockton was the son of Annis Boudinot Stockton and Richard Stockton, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He was born at Morven, the family's estate in Princeton, New Jersey. His brother, also named Richard Stockton, would go on to be the first U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey and to represent the state in the U.S. Senate. In later life, he was often referred to as Horace. Stockton graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1787. He studied law and settled in Trenton, where he established a large practice. He was appointed U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey in 1798, serving until 1801. On January 13, 1801, President John Adams nominated Stockton to be Secretary of War, weeks before the end of his administration, in a move that incensed President-Elect Thomas Jefferson. On January 20, 1801, Richard Stockton, a congressman and the brother of Lucius wrote a letter to the Honorable Johnathan Dayton (a signer of the Constitution) asking Dayton to inform Adams that Lucius would not accept the nomination, and a letter to President Adams was enclosed. Stockton was known as a strongly partisan supporter of the Federalist Party. Secretary of the Treasury Oliver Wolcott, Jr. at the time called him \\"a crazy, fanatical young man.\\" The nomination was later withdrawn by Adams. In 1803, Stockton wrote a series of articles in the Trenton Federalist defending himself and his late uncle Samuel W. Stockton from attacks by the True American, a Democratic-Republican organ. On July 4, 1814, Stockton delivered the main address at the New Jersey Friends of Peace Convention, organized by Federalists opposed to U.S. involvement in the War of 1812. He was also the organizer of the Washington Benevolent Society of Trenton. He died on May 26, 1835 and was buried in Trenton.

History The first settlers, mostly Irish and Scottish Loyalists, came around 1825 to the shores of Lake Maskinong√©, where they formed a community that was known as Lake Maskinong√© Settlement by 1827, and later as the Mission of Lac-Maskinong√©. In 1837, the name Saint-Gabriel-du-Lac-Maskinong√© came in use but was changed to Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon in 1840. This name refers to the angel Gabriel and the geographic township of Brandon that was proclaimed in 1827 and in which it is located. In 1851, the Parish of Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon was founded and the post office opened that same year. In 1855, the parish municipality was established with the same name. In 1892, the main settlement on Lake Maskinong√© separated from the parish municipality and became the Village Municipality of Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon (now known as the Town of Saint- Gabriel). On June 14, 2014, Saint-Gabriel-de-Brandon changed from parish municipality to a (regular) municipality.

It runs through the Upper East Side neighborhood (in ZIP code 10021, where it is known as East 74th Street) and the Upper West Side neighborhood (in ZIP code 10023, where it is known as West 74th Street), on both sides of Central Park. History In 1639, Colony's Sawmill stood at the corner of East 74th Street and Second Avenue, in the Dutch village of New Amsterdam, at which African laborers cut lumber. In 1664, the English took over Manhattan and the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam from the Dutch. English colonial Governor Richard Nicolls made 74th Street, beginning at the East River, the southern border patent line (which was called the \\"Harlem Line\\") of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the village of Harlem); the British also renamed the village \\"Lancaster\\". That same year Jan van Bonnel built a sawmill on East 74th Street and the East River, where a creek or stream, which began in the north of today's Central Park and became known as Saw Kill or Saw Kill Creek, emptied into the river. George Elphinstone and Abraham Shotwell, later owners of the property, replaced the sawmill with a leather mill in 1677. The Saw Kill Bridge was built and since at least 1806 was known as \\"The Kissing Bridge\\" because its surrounding beautiful landscape and seclusion made it a favorite spot to kiss in 18th and 19th century Manhattan. East 74th Street between Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue) and Fifth Avenue was the northern boundary of a farm known as the \\"Lenox Farm\\" created by pieces of land that Robert Lenox purchased in 1818; the area later became known as Lenox Hill. Frederick Ambrose Clark developed a good portion of West 74th Street in 1902‚Äì04. In 1938, an open-air market on East 74th Street, east of Second Avenue, was supplanted by an enclosed market. Transportation The closest subway stop for East 74th Street on the Upper East Side is the 72nd Street station on the Second Avenue Subway (), at Second Avenue.

Measuring over , it is on the land of the former Ak-Sar-Ben coliseum and horse track. There is over of space for research and business office and of retail and entertainment space. There are over five hundred housing units and a 135-room hotel. There is also a park that features a obelisk. History Aksarben was one of the of the \\"model communities\\" designed in the mid-1930s by the Resettlement Administration, one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal federal agencies, under the direction of Rexford G. Tugwell. The community was intended to be a \\"'dream city' of thirty-eight green-shuttered houses, each on seven acres of land twenty miles west of Omaha on the Platte River.\\" This plan failed to materialize, as the imagined dream city failed to attract residents. Aksarben quickly became deserted, as Henry C. Glissman, a nearby farmer who observed this project, had predicted: \\"[I]n time these homes will all be abandoned and stand as a gruesome monument to a government's inefficiency and folly in fostering a movement that to a practical mind has the earmarks of failure from the start.\\" Folsom, Burton W., Jr., New Deal or Raw Deal? How FDR's Economic Legacy Has Damaged America. New York: Threshold Editions, 2008. After the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben turned over the land to Douglas County in the 1990s, the county first tried to keep the horse track and coliseum open, but both failed. The land was then turned over to the Aksarben Future Trust who now owns the land. On June 26, 2005, plans were announced to turn the land into a pedestrian friendly mixed-use development combined with the south campus of University of Nebraska Omaha, Aksarben Campus, and the already built First Data Campus. Construction began in 2006 and the first businesses began to open in 2008. Aksarben is Nebraska spelled backwards. Developments Aksarben Village is home to some of Omaha's major companies. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska has built and is occupying a 10-story building that opened in 2010 to house their headquarters. First Data built two office buildings there in the mid-2000s. Other business that have opened offices include DLR Group, Grubb & Ellis/Pacific Realty, and Olsson. Additional developments in Aksarben Village. Several restaurants such as Jones Bros. Cupcakes, Godfather's Pizza and Juice Stop have opened, as well as a bank, a Voodoo Taco, a Spirit World wine and liquor seller, a hair salon, and multiple bars and lounges. Two apartment complexes have opened, Broadmoor and the Pinhook Flats, named in reference to the historic horse track which used to occupy the land. Together the apartments add over 500 housing units to the development. A 135-room Marriott Hotel opened in 2008; Aksarben Cinema, a 10-screen movie theater debuted in late 2010 and shortly after an Aspen Athletic Club fitness center opened in the same complex. Mojo Steakhouse and Ales, a full-service restaurant and bar, opened in 2011 in the same complex. The University of Nebraska Omaha has built their south campus, Aksarben Campus, at the north end of Aksarben Village. The university has added ten three-story dormitory buildings, Scott Village, which opened in 2003 and houses 480 units. The Scott Technology Center and the Peter Kiewit Institute are world class educational and research facilities that partner with UNO and are located on campus. The university has also built the new Baxter Arena at the south end of Aksarben Village. Within Aksarben Village is Stinson Park, a multi-acre neighborhood and community park named after Kenneth E. Stinson, a former chairman of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben and Kiewit Corporation.

The species was discovered by John Milton Bigelow in 1854 and described by John Torrey in 1856. The specific epithet andrewsiana honors Timothy Langdon Andrews (1819-1908), a \\"gentleman who assiduously examined the botany\\" of California during the mid-19th century. The species is commonly known as Andrews clintonia or red clintonia, where the latter refers to the color of the flowers. In California, it is also known as bluebead lily or western bluebead lily, not to be confused with C. borealis, which is likewise known as bluebead lily. The Pomo people of northern California considered the plant to be poisonous. Description Clintonia andrewsiana is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes. It is the largest plant species in the genus, standing tall. Around the base of the plant are 5 or 6 oval-shaped, dark green leaves, each long and wide. The tall, erect inflorescence consists of a terminal umbel with 10-20 flowers and up to three lateral umbels with 2-4 flowers each. Each flower has six pink to reddish-purple tepals long and six stamens about half as long as the tepals. The fruit is a blue or blue-black berry approximately in diameter. File:Clintonia andrewsiana cbm.pngIllustration by John Nugent Fitch File:Clintoniaandrewsiana.jpgRipe fruit Distribution Clintonia andrewsiana is found along the West Coast of the United States, from Monterey County in central California north to Curry County in southwestern Oregon. It prefers the shady, moist areas of the coastal redwood forests. The range of C. andrewsiana overlaps with that of C. uniflora in Humboldt County and Del Norte County in northwestern California and Curry County in Oregon, but the two species are readily distinguished by their flowers. C. andrewsiana has multiple flowers arranged in one or more umbels while C. uniflora has a single flower with white tepals. The tepals of C. andrewsiana are a deep claret red.

Known at that time for his comedic work and not for performing hip hop, Cosby's album came as a surprise to some. Patterson told the Associated Press that when Cosby contacted him about making the album, \\"people started speculating, is he going to rap about Jell-O Pudding Pops or what?\\" The resulting release, titled The Cosnarati: State Of Emergency, came out on November 14, 2009 on World Alert Music.

The bacteria are able to grow in acidic conditions, while the spores are able to survive typical pasteurization procedures. Overview Alicyclobacilli are strictly aerobic, acidophilic, mesophilic to thermophilic, soil-dwelling organisms. Alicyclobacilli are of special interest to the fruit juice canning industry because common pasteurization techniques (92 ¬∞C for 10 seconds) do not deactivate the spores;Alicyclobacillus, the Beverage Industry and the BioSys Rapid Microbiology. Retrieved 2010-12-22 Alicyclobacillus species can have a D95-value of over 8 minutes (requiring treatment of over 8 minutes at 95 ¬∞C to kill 90% of spores). When a product is spoiled by Alicyclobacillus, the juice products develop a disinfectant-like odor and/or flavor (due to guaiacol production), but the bacteria do not cause swelling of the package or discoloration of the product, nor is it pathogenic to humans. Alicyclobacilli have been implicated in spoilages of pear, orange, peach, mango, and white grape juice, fruit juice blends, and tomato products. Not all Alicyclobacilli produce guaiacol, and thus not all species are of spoilage concern. A. consociatus and A. pohliae were originally classified in genus Alicyclobacillus, but were later reclassified into the novel genus Effusibacillus in 2014. Most Alicyclobacillus species optimally grow in the 40-55 ¬∞C range. The exceptions include A. acidocaldarius (65 ¬∞C), A. aeris (30 ¬∞C), A. disulfidooxidans (35 ¬∞C), and A. ferrooxydans (28 ¬∞C). A. acidocaldarius is the most thermotolerant, as is able to grow in temperatures up to 70 ¬∞C. A. disulfidooxidans is the only psychrotroph, being able to grow at 4 ¬∞C. Most species can grow in the pH 2.0-6.0 range, and none have been shown to grow above pH 6.5. A. disulfidooxidans is the most acid-tolerant, and can grow at pH 0.5. Background The first Alicyclobacillus species was isolated in 1967 from hot springs, and was named Bacillus acidocaldarius. However, it was not until 1982 that the organisms were implicated in the spoilage of apple juice. The next outbreak occurred in 1994, and based on 16S rRNA studies, a separate genus was proposed. The genus name derives from œâ-alicyclic fatty acids as the major component in the cellular membrane, and to reflect the previous classification as Bacillus. A. acidoterrestris is considered the most important spoilage species within the genus Alicyclobacillus, but A. acidocaldarius, A. pomorum, and A. herbarius have also been isolated from spoiled product. Soil is a common habitat for species of Alicyclobacillus, and is likely the source for contamination of food products. Impact The canning industry works under the assumption that bacterial spores will not germinate at pH values below 4.6, and that acid- tolerant organisms are not very heat resistant. In this case, a low heat pasteurization process is applicable. However, the emergence of Alicyclobacillus as a spoilage organism has led some researchers to advocate using A. acidoterrestris as the reference organism to design pasteurization processes for high acid foods, just as the thermal death time of Clostridium botulinum was used to design the sterilization process for low acid canned foods. High-pressure processing has been shown to be effective at inactivating A. acidoterrestris spores in orange juice. One survey of 8556 samples of fruit and vegetable juices found Alicyclobacillus in 13% of samples, while another study found Alicyclobacillus in 6% out of 180 samples, and another found the bacteria in 14% out of 75 samples. In The Netherlands in 2013, contamination of raspberry with Alicyclobacillus in pasteurized juices led to a public recall after consumers complained about bad taste and odor.Graanoogst, Audrey.

It is covered with dark and light spots on the upperparts and is usually about in length. The tail is long and muscular, but breaks off easily. Very common throughout Fernando de Noronha, it is an opportunistic feeder, eating both insects and plant material, including nectar from the Erythrina velutina tree, as well as other material ranging from cookie crumbs to eggs of its own species. Introduced predators such as feral cats prey on it and several parasitic worms infect it. Perhaps seen by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, it was first formally described in 1839. Its subsequent taxonomic history has been complex, riddled with confusion with Trachylepis maculata and other species, homonyms, and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus Trachylepis and is thought to have reached its island from Africa by rafting. The enigmatic Trachylepis tschudii, supposedly from Peru, may well be the same species. Discovery and taxonomy In an early account of what may be Fernando de Noronha, purportedly based on a voyage by Amerigo Vespucci in 1503, the island was said to be inhabited by \\"lizards with two tails\\", which is thought be a reference to the Noronha skink.Carleton and Olson, 1999, p. 48 The tail is long and fragile, and it breaks easily, like that of many skinks and other lizards, following which it may regenerate. However, when it does not completely break off, a new tail may nevertheless grow out of the broken part, so that the tail appears forked. 19th century The species was first formally described by John Edward Gray in 1839, based on two specimens collected by HMS Chanticleer before 1838.Schmidt, 1945, p. 45; Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 292 He introduced the names Tiliqua punctata, for the Noronha skink, and Tiliqua maculata, for a species from Guyana, among many others.Gray, 1839, p. 289 Six years later, he transferred both to the genus Euprepis. In 1887, George Boulenger placed both in the genus Mabuya (misspelled \\"Mabuia\\") and considered them identical, using the name \\"Mabuia punctata\\" for the species, which was said to occur both on Fernando de Noronha and in Guyana. He also included Mabouya punctatissima O'Shaughnessy, 1874, purportedly from South Africa, as a synonym.Boulenger, 1887, pp. 160‚Äì161 In 1874, A.W.E. O'Shaughnessy described the new species Mabouya punctatissima on the basis of a specimen, purchased from a Mr. Parzudaki, which had been labeled as coming from the Cape of Good Hope, a location O'Shaughnessy considered \\"very doubtful\\".O'Shaughnessy, 1874, p. 300. G.A. Boulenger, in 1887 synonymized it under Mabuia punctata (the Noronha skink) without comment, a position followed by H. Travassos with some doubt. The latter wrote that the description of punctatissima suggested to him that punctatissima and the Noronha skink are morphologically different, but that Boulenger's examination of the type and the uncertainty of the type locality inclined him to favor the synonymy.Travassos, 1946, pp. 7-8. In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic re-examined the holotype, which is the only known specimen. It is similar to T. atlantica, but larger, and lacks well-developed keels on its dorsal scales. Therefore, they suggested that it was not the same as T. atlantica and that its original locality may have been correct. Although it may represent a valid species of southern African Trachylepis, the name Trachylepis punctatissima is preoccupied by Euprepes punctatissimus A. Smith, 1849, also currently placed in Trachylepis.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 294. 20th century In 1900, L.G. Andersson claimed that Gray's name punctata was preoccupied by Lacerta punctata Linnaeus, 1758, which he identified as Mabuya homalocephala. He therefore replaced the name punctata with its junior synonym maculata, using the name Mabuya maculata for the skink of Fernando de Noronha.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 292 Linnaeus's Lacerta punctata in fact refers to the Asian species Lygosoma punctatum, not to Mabuya homalocephala, but Gray's name punctata remains invalid regardless.Bauer, 2003, p. 4 In 1931, C.E. and M.D. Burt resurrected the name Mabuya punctata (now spelled correctly) for the Noronha skink, noting that it was \\"apparently a very distinct species\\", but did not mention maculata, and in 1935, E.R. Dunn disputed Boulenger's conclusion as to the synonymy of punctata and maculata and, in apparent ignorance of Andersson's work, restored the name Mabuya punctata for the Noronha skink.Dunn, 1935, pp. 535‚Äì536 He wrote that the Noronha skink was very distinct from other American Mabuya and more similar in some respects to African species.Dunn, 1935, p. 536 K.P. Schmidt, in 1945, agreed with Dunn's conclusion that maculata and punctata of Gray were not the same, but he noted Andersson's point that punctata was preoccupied and therefore introduced the new name Mabuya atlantica to replace punctata.Schmidt, 1945, p. 45 The next year, H. Travassos, disagreeing with Dunn and unaware of Andersson's and Schmidt's contributions,Travassos, 1948, p. 201 considered both of Gray's names to be synonymous and restored the name Mabuya punctata for the Noronha skink.Travassos, 1946, pp. 6‚Äì7 He also considered Mabouya punctatissima and Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata Tschudi, 1845, described from Peru, as synonyms of this species.Travassos, 1946, pp. 7‚Äì8 In 1948, he acknowledged the preoccupation of punctata noted by Andersson and accordingly retired Mabuya punctata in favor of Mabuya maculata, as Andersson had done.Travassos, 1948, p. 206 The name Mabuya maculata remained in general usage for the Noronha skink in subsequent decades, though some have used Mabuya punctata, \\"not ... aware of the last nomenclatural changes.\\" 21st century Trachylepis maculata has long been confused with the Noronha skink. In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic published a note on the nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original type specimens; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently the first to do so since Boulenger in 1887.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 293 Based on differences in the number of scales, subdigital lamellae (lamellae on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the dorsal scales (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the parietal scales (on the head behind the eyes) in maculata, they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name Mabuya atlantica should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered Mabouya punctatissima to represent a different species on the basis of morphological differences, but were unable to resolve the status of Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata. In the same year, Mausfeld and others conducted a molecular phylogenetic study on the Noronha skink, using the mitochondrial 12S and 16S rRNA genes, and showed that the species is more closely related to African than to South American Mabuya species,Mausfeld et al., 2002, p. 281 as previously suggested on the basis of morphological similarities.Whiting et al., 2006, pp. 720‚Äì721 They split the old genus Mabuya into four genera for geographically discrete clades, including Euprepis for the African‚ÄìNoronha clade, thus renaming the Noronha species to Euprepis atlanticus.Mausfeld et al., 2002, p. 290 In 2003, A.M. Bauer found that the name Euprepis had been incorrectly applied to this clade and that Trachylepis was correct instead, so that the Noronha skink is currently referred to as Trachylepis atlantica.Bauer, 2003, p. 5Bauer, 2003, p. 5, corrected the generic name from Euprepis to Trachylepis, but did not explicitly use the name combination Trachylepis atlantica, which was first used by Ananjeva et al., 2006, p. 76. Additional molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2003 and 2006 confirmed the relationship between the Noronha skink and African Trachylepis.Carranza and Arnold, 2003; Whiting et al., 2006 In 2009, Miralles and others reviewed the taxon maculata and concluded that the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable to determine whether or not it is indigenous to Guyana.Miralles et al., 2009, p. 62 They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata.Miralles et al., 2009, p. 57 Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T. tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.Miralles et al., 2009, p. 58 Description Noronha skinks are very common on Fernando de Noronha. The Noronha skink is covered with light and dark spots above, but there is substantial variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow.Dunn, 1935, p. 536; Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 293; Finley, 1945, p. 164 It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front at the sides of the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya.Dunn, 1935, p. 536; Miralles et al., 2009, p. 57 The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.Travassos, 1946, p. 8 In reptiles, features of the scales are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the supranasal scales (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the prefrontal scales (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two frontoparietal scales (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in T. maculata, the parietal scales (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four supraocular scales (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five supraciliary scales (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The dorsal scales (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in T. maculata. There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63‚Äì64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) ventral scales (on the underparts).Travassos, 1946, pp. 26‚Äì28; summarized in Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, table 1; nomenclature from Avila-Pires, 1995, pp. 9‚Äì10; Schleich et al., 1996, p. 372 Mabuya species and T. maculata generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34).Dunn, 1935, p. 536; Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, pp. 293‚Äì294; Miralles et al., 2009, p. 65 There are 21 to 29 subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in T. maculata, which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26 presacral vertebrae (located before the sacrum), similar to most Trachylepis, but unlike American Mabuya, which have at least 28.Greer et al., 2000, table 1 Although there is substantial variation in measurements within the species, no discrete groups can be detected and it is not possible to separate the sexes unambiguously using measurements alone.Travassos, 1946, p. 51 Among 15 male and 21 female T. atlantica collected in 2006, snout to vent length was , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females and body mass was , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Males are significantly larger than females. In 100 specimens collected in 1876,Travassos, 1946, pp. 2‚Äì3 head length was , averaging ; head width was , averaging , and tail length was , averaging 117 mm.Travassos, 1946, pp. 26‚Äì28; summarized in Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, table 1 Ecology and behavior Noronha skinks bask in the sun for thermoregulation. The Noronha skink is very abundant throughout Fernando de Noronha,Carleton and Olson, 1999, p. 48; Rocha et al., 2009, p. 450; Gasparini et al., 2007, p. 31; Silva et al., 2005, p. 62 even occurring commonly in houses,Silva et al., 2005, p. 62 and also occurs on the smaller islands that surround the main island of the archipelago.Ridley, 1888b, p. 476 Its abundance may be a result of the absence of ecologically similar competitors.Rocha et al., 2009, p. 458 Apart from T. atlantica, the reptile fauna of Fernando de Noronha consists of the indigenous amphisbaenian Amphisbaena ridleyi and two introduced lizards, the gecko Hemidactylus mabouia and the tegu Tupinambis merianae.Rocha et al., 2009, p. 450 The species is found in several microhabitats, but most often on rocks. Although predominantly ground-dwelling, it is a good climber.Sazima et al., 2005, p. 7 Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed little evidence of reproductive activity.Rocha et al., 2009, pp. 452, 457 The Noronha skink is oviparous (egg-laying), like many Trachylepis, but unlike Mabuya, which are all viviparous (giving live birth).Mausfeld et al., 2002, p. 289 Trachylepis atlantica is active during the day. Its body temperature averages , a few degrees higher than the environment temperature. During the day, body temperature peaks at up to around midday and is lower earlier and later. In the early morning, the lizard may bask in the sun. During foraging, it spends about 28.4% of its time moving on average, a relatively high value for Trachylepis.Rocha et al., 2009, p. 453 A geologist who visited the island in 1876Branner, 1888, p. 861 noted that the skink is curious and bold: > While seated upon the bare rocks I have often observed these little animals > watching me, apparently with as much curiosity as I watched them, turning > their heads from side to side as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet > for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, > they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above > the edges to watch me.Branner, 1888, pp. 866‚Äì867 Diet Insects form an important part of the diet of the Noronha skink. The Noronha skink is an opportunistic omnivoreSilva et al., 2005, p. 63 and \\"thrives on anything edible\\".Sazima et al., 2005, p. 2 Analysis of stomach contents indicates that it mainly eats plant material, at least during the dry period,Rocha et al., 2009, p. 457 but it also feeds on insects, including larvae, termites (Isoptera), ants (Formicidae), and beetles (Coleoptera).Rocha et al., 2009, p. 454 Its prey is mostly mobile, rather than sedentary,Rocha et al., 2009, p. 455 which is consistent with the relatively high proportion of time it spends moving.Rocha et al., 2009, p. 456 Related skink species eat mostly insects, but island populations may often be more herbivorous. Animal prey averages 6.9 mm3 in volume, less than in most other Trachylepis. When the mulungu tree Erythrina velutina blooms during the dry season, Noronha skinks climb up to to reach the inflorescences of the tree and to eat the nectar by inserting their heads into the flowers. They probably use the nectar both for its sugar and water content. In this way, the skinks aid in pollinating the tree, as they acquire pollen on their scales and leave pollen on stigmas when visiting a flower.Sazima et al., 2009, p. 26 Pollination is rare behavior among lizards, but occurs most frequently in island species. Humans have introduced additional food sources to the island, including Acacia seeds, feces of the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), carrion flies, juvenile Hemidactylus mabouya, and even cookie crumbs given by tourists.Gasparini et al., 2007, p. 30 The availability of these additional food sources may increase the abundance of the skink.Gasparini et al., 2007, p. 32 In 1887, H. N. Ridley observed Noronha skinks eating banana skins and yolk from doves' eggs.Ridley, 1888a, p. 46 Several cases of cannibalism have been reported, involving skinks eating eggs, juveniles, and the tail of an adult.Silva et al., 2005, table 1 Relationships with other species The Noronha skink feeds on nectar from the tree Erythrina velutina. The Noronha skink probably lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha was discovered by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the cat (Felis catus) and cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis). These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island.Silva et al., 2005, p. 63; Gasparini et al., 2007, p. 32 The Argentine black and white tegu lizard, Tupinambis merianae, and three introduced rodents, the house mouse (Mus musculus), brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and black rat (Rattus rattus), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks. According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is infected by several parasitic worms, most frequently by the nematode Spinicauda spinicauda. Another nematode, Moaciria alvarengai, is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two trematodes‚ÄîMesocoelium monas and an undetermined species of Platynossomum‚Äîand an undetermined species of Oochoristica, a cestode.Ramalho et al., 2009, p. 1026 S. spinicauda is usually only found in teiid lizards; it may have entered the archipelago when Tupinambis merianae, a teiid, was introduced to the island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported M. alvarengai and Thelandros alvarengai from the skink; the presence of S. spinicauda could explain the rarity of M. alvarengai and absence of T. alvarengai in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.Ramalho et al., 2009, p. 1027 Origin View of Morro do Pico on Fernando de Noronha Phylogenetic analyses using a variety of mitochondrial and nuclear genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of Trachylepis,Whiting et al., 2006, pp. 721, 726; Mausfeld et al., 2002, pp. 282, 286; Carranza and Arnold, 2003, pp. 271, 281 a position also supported by morphological similarities.Mausfeld and Vrcibradic, 2002, p. 294; Carranza and Arnold, 2003, p. 277; Miralles et al., 2009, fig. 6 It may have arrived on its island on rafting vegetation from southwestern Africa via the Benguela Current and the South Equatorial Current, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by Alfred Russel Wallace before 1888.Branner, 1888, p. 871 Mausfeld and coworkers calculated that the journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via Ascension Island, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.Mausfeld et al., 2002, pp. 286‚Äì287; Carranza and Arnold, 2003, p. 281 The South American and Caribbean Mabuya skinks form a clade that appears to be derived from a separate colonization from Africa.Whiting et al., 2006, pp. 724‚Äì729; Mausfeld et al., 2002, pp. 285‚Äì287; Carranza and Arnold, 2003 Both transatlantic colonization events are believed to have occurred within the last 9 million years.Carranza and Arnold, 2003, p. 281 Notes References External links *Trachylepis atlantica in the Reptile Database Literature cited * Ananjeva, N.B., Orlov, N.L., Khalikov, R.G., Darevsky, I.S. and Barabanov, A. 2006.

He is most notable within boxing for winning the Canadian middleweight boxing championship in 1926 and again in 1931. In 1932 he travelled to Britain to continue his boxing career, and began a relationship with Hilda Meeks of Bristol. In 1935, Fontaine was arrested and convicted of the murder of Miss Meeks and was hanged at Wandsworth Prison.Del Fontane biography boxrec.com Fontaine's boxing style was described as aggressive and crowd-pleasing, but with a poor regard for defence. Boxing career French Canadian Fontaine was a resident of Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his first recorded boxing match against Sammy Hudson, a fellow Canadian from Moose Jaw. Fontaine won the bout by knockout in the fifth. Fontaine was unbeaten in his next six matches, including a draw with Jack Reddick, who was at the time Canadian light heavyweight champion. On 14 August 1925, Fontaine faced Harry Dillon at Regina, Saskatchewan for the vacant Canadian middleweight title. The fight went the distance of ten rounds, and Dillon won the Championship on a points decision. Despite his first professional defeat, Fontaine returned quickly to his original form, finishing his next four contests undefeated. On 8 May 1926, Fontaine had his second attempt at the Canadian middleweight belt which had become vacant. Fought in Ottawa against Henry Henning, Fontaine won the match and the title in the second round with a technical knockout over his opponent. From this point, Fontaine attracted a better class of fighter, beginning with his first fight outside Canada, travelling to Philadelphia in a win over experienced American Bobby Marriott. His biggest fight to date came on 16 August 1926 when Welsh fighter Frank Moody travelled from the U.S. to Canada to face Fontaine. The contest went the distance, with Moody victorious. Fontaine finished the year with two bouts in the U.S., a win over Joe Anderson followed by a points loss to Rocky Smith. The following year Fontaine travelled widely around the U.S. and Canada fighting with mixed results. His most notable fight that year was against Vincent Forgione, facing him twice in two months. After losing to Forgione by points in their first encounter, Fontaine was knocked out for the first time in his professional career when he faced Forgione for their second contest in July 1927. Fontaine continued fighting in North America over the next four years, and at the end of 1931 he faced Ted Moore, regaining the Canadian middleweight title. In early 1931 Fontaine travelled from Canada to the United Kingdom by cattle boat to further his boxing career. Over the next three years Fontaine faced many of Britain's most successful middleweight boxers, including Billy Bird, Jack Casey, Gipsy Daniels, Tommy Farr, Jack Hyams and Harry Mason. From his arrival in the U.K., Fontaine's fight record was good with 23 wins, 4 losses and 3 draws, but from November 1933 his form took a terrible reversal with 4 wins, 16 losses and 2 draws. This string of poor results would later be used as Fontaine's defence during his murder trial, with his defence counsel stating he was \\"punch drunk\\" and therefore of diminished responsibility. Murder charge and execution Murder of Hilda Meeks Fontaine and Meek Although Fontaine had a wife and children back in Canada, he had begun a two-year relationship with 21-year-old Hilda Meeks whilst living in Britain. Bristol-born Meeks was a one-time West End waitress, with dreams of becoming a dancer. Hilda was described by her friends as \\"flighty\\". On 10 July 1935, she was caught by Fontaine making a date with another man on the telephone. Fontaine, who was known to drink, confronted Meeks, taking the phone from her and challenged the man she was speaking to. Meeks' mother came into the room to protect her daughter and Fontaine pulled out a revolver. As Meeks ran into the street, Fontaine fatally shot her, he then fired a second shot into her mother. When Sam Meeks, Hilda's father, returned home he saw Fontaine carrying his daughter back into the house. Fontaine stated \\"I've done for her and done for the old woman\\", showing that he believed he had killed both women, though in fact the mother had survived. At the trial Fontaine's defence contended that the boxer was suffering from acute depression and was probably \\"punch drunk\\". The defence called upon Ted Lewis, a former welterweight champion, who stated \\"Del shouldn't have been in the ring at all for his last fight. He wasn't in a fit state. ... As a boxer, he has received more punishment than anyone I have ever seen.\\" Sam Meeks countered the claim believing that Fontaine had thrown his later fights. Fontaine was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. Execution By the time the execution date had been decided, protests had started pleading for a reprieve. A long petition was delivered, but to no avail. On the morning of 29 October 1935 a crowd gathered outside Wandsworth Prison, hymns were sung and politicians made anti-capital punishment speeches. That morning Fontaine was executed. Fontaine left a note \\"Hilda Meeks broke my heart I spent my last cent on her. She turned me against my own wife.\\" A warden at the prison is quoted as saying \\"He was the bravest fellow we ever saw go to the scaffold.\\" References External links * 1904 births 1935 deaths Sportspeople from Winnipeg Middleweight boxers 20th-century executions by England and Wales People convicted of murder by England and Wales Canadian people executed abroad Executed Canadian people Canadian people convicted of murder Canadian male boxers ","title":"Del Fontaine"},{"id":"25147319","text":"Roseray is a hamlet in Saskatchewan.

Their music, characterised as New Flamenco and World Music, is a blend of Gypsy, Latin, Celtic, Flamenco, Middle Eastern, Rock, Jazz, Cuban Swing, Tango and Salsa. The duo produced 11 albums, mainly on the Narada label. They have also been included in at least three compilations of Guitar and Flamenco music. Their album, Gypsy Boogaloo, spent 17 weeks on the Billboard's World Music Chart in 1993, 10 weeks in the number two position . Their album Zambra spent 3 weeks Billboard's New Age Album chart in 2006, peaking at number 4. Their music has been called the Flamenco equivalent of smooth jazz by Chris Nickson, a reviewer on allmusic.com. Tom Phalen of the Seattle Times found it fiery and frantic: \\"Although the basis is flamenco, it can go in a half-dozen directions at any time. Mostly it's about strong, involving instrumental melodies and having fun.\\" Gypsy Boogaloo, their best charting album, was called one of the best exotic musical dishes of the early '90s by Jonathan Widran of the All Music Guide. History Willie Royal was born in El Paso, Texas, the son of an Air Force lieutenant colonel. His father's job took young Royal over the world including Turkey, Germany and France. At the age of eight he began classical violin lessons, quickly becoming proficient enough to become the concertmaster of his high school orchestra. Inspired by the music of Jean-Luc Ponty, Stephane Grappelli and It's A Beautiful Day, as well as sitting in with Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts, Willie traveled the world, absorbing numerous musical styles before moving to Mexico in the '80s.Willie and Lobo's Biography http://www.willieandlobo.com/redesign/biography.htm Wolfgang \\"Lobo\\" Fink was born in the Bavarian town of Teisendorf. At 18, while in the German navy, he picked up his first guitar. Listening to an album by gypsy guitarist Manitas de Plata drew him to the music. Upon leaving the navy, he found de Plata in a gypsy camp in Southern France and spent a while with him and his people. Returning to Germany, Lobo formed a flamenco group named Lailo, touring Europe for three years and helping to popularize the modern gypsy sound. His searches led him to Granada, Spain, living with gypsies in the caves of Sacromonte and studying their ways. He traveled to Mexico in 1980 as a solo act. The pair first met in San Miguel de Allende, in Mexico, where they were both working at Mama Mia's restaurant. Willie on fiddle and Lobo on flamenco guitar jammed on occasion, searching for an individual sound. The owner of a local bar they were both playing at suggested they perform together.Willie & Lobo World Music Night http://www.goldstar.com/events/agoura-hills-ca/willie-and-lobo-world- music-night.html?expired=true > Virtually one listen or one concert was all it took for many fans to become > lost in their sound, which Royal described as somehow sounding like it was > made by four musicians instead of two.Willie and Lobo return to town > http://www.gainesville.com/article/20100121/COLUMNISTS/1211012?p=2&tc;=pg Royal died following complications from Alzheimer's in 2016.

The phrase \\"University of North Texas Libraries\\" encompasses three aspects: The library collections as a whole and its organizational structure; The physical facilities and digital platform that house the collections; and Certain self-contained collections of substantial size that warrant the name \\"Library\\"‚Äîthe Music Library and the Digital Libraries (collections), for example, are housed in Willis Library (the building).  Library buildings   Willis Library  The Willis Library, with Jody's Fountain in the foreground The Willis Library is the main library of the University of North Texas. It houses business, economics, education, humanities, and social sciences collections. It also houses microforms and special collections such as the Music Library, the Digital Libraries, and Archives and Rare Books. Originally known as the Library when first constructed in 1969, the building was renamed in honor of A.M. Willis, Jr., in 1978 during his thirteenth year as a regent for the university and ninth year as chairman of the Board of Regents. The building‚Äîoriginally designed as three buildings to be erected in three phases‚Äîwas designed by Caudill Rowlett Scott and opened the summer of 1971. It was formally dedicated April 25, 1972. The building is the third of four university buildings to bear the name of a regent. The first, a dormitory, was Kerr Hall (1969). The second, a classroom building, was Wooten Hall (1970). The fourth is the Murchison Performing Arts Center. The Willis Library was the third library building. The first two structures were: * Sycamore Hall, the current site of The Eagle Commons Library, was built in 1937. The Eagle Commons Library houses a technical collection. * O.J. Curry Hall, was dedicated in 1950 in honor of Othel Jackson Curry, PhD (1904‚Äì1994), Dean of the College of Business from 1946 to 1969. Of the original design‚Äîa center section and two wings‚Äîonly the center section was constructed. Its location is the site of the institution's first football field. The university received a federal grant of $1,456,783 that paid for one third of the cost. The remaining two-thirds was raised through the sale of bonds. The regents, sans-Willis, resolved to name the library to honor Willis for his \\"loyal and devoted service.\\" Willis invested great personal effort into the planning and construction of the library. Aside from being a rapid reader with a large personal library, Willis felt that erecting a large, centrally located, beautiful facility for current and future collections was a high priority. He viewed it as a fundamental building-block, particularly at post-baccalaureate and research levels. North Texas, at the time, was already well known for some of its collections, particularly music. = Student Computing Commons = The 24-Hour Student Computing Commons at Willis is part of the Student Computer Lab System at North Texas. The 24hr Commons in Willis Library has about 300 computers, 120 laptops and is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week during long semesters in the academic calendar.  Media Library at Chilton Hall  The Media Library contains the UNT Libraries' nonprint, audiovisual collections, which include films, audiobooks, and video games. One of the missions of the UNT Media Library is to support the instructional and research needs of UNT faculty, staff, and students by collecting, maintaining, and providing access to media materials that represent all academic disciplines and all genres of film. Video recording equipment and gaming consoles are available for checkout.  Eagle Commons Library  The second library was built in 1937 on Chestnut Street and Avenue B, facing west. When the building opened, it contained 72,000 volumes, a broadcasting studio and a small auditorium. The building also housed a bindery, art department and classrooms. The building was expanded in 1952 and 1958. In 1961, the auditorium was converted into a reading room and the browsing room into a stack area. Air conditioning was installed in the public areas, but not in the closed stacks area, in 1962. April 27, 2011 was the grand opening of the Eagle Commons Library, formally known as the Science and Technology Library. The structure was renovated to provide \\"space more suitable for group study and presentations.\\" The building has had three names: Library, Information Sciences, and was changed to Sycamore Hall in June 2011. The Eagle Commons Library in Sycamore Hall houses the Government Documents, law, political science, geography and business collections. It also houses the Collaboration and Learning Commons, an ideal place to study in groups, create multi-media projects, and record presentations.  Discovery Park Library  The Discovery Park Library houses collections and access workstations for the College of Engineering and the College of Information, Library Science, and Technologies. Multiple areas of engineering, library and information science, and learning technology comprise its holdings.  Library Annex  The current Library Annex was built in 1994 and is located across I-35, near the Recreational Sports Complex. It is a three-story building with 56 rooms totaling . The building replaced the Library Annex that opened in 1958, adjoining the Main Library that is now the Eagle Commons Library.  Special collections   Music Library at Willis  The Music Library, part of the Special Libraries Division, serves the entire university, but specializes in the scholarly and performance research needs of the College of Music. = History = Most major music libraries share the trait of having started building collections early, as early as 1940‚Äîsome long before. The New York Public Library, Harvard, Cornell, and Columbia University‚Äîand national libraries, such as the Library of Congress‚Äîare among those that had already accumulated formidable collections. Some academic libraries, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, hold rare historical works simply because the library itself is historic. Music library acquisitions, simply put, are typically achieved three ways: (i) through a buying program from publishers, (ii) through archiving of original works of the host institution, and (iii) through donations or purchases of non-published, non-duplicated materials. The latter two, more so than the first, give each Music Library its own distinct identity. After World War I, sheet music publishers‚Äînamely those from Tin Pan Alley‚Äîexperienced unprecedented growth that was fueled for the next three decades by composers, technological advancements‚Äîand also market saturation owed partly to higher quality of recorded sound, radio, and film. The boom was so great that even some \\"established\\" music libraries were facing challenges relating to expectations of the scope of acquisitions deviating from European classical to avant-garde, popular, jazz, blues, folk, and experimental. Standardization of uniform cataloging of a music industry that had little knowledge of the pioneering music librarianship was a large undertaking. By the late 1930s, music librarianship was recognized as a new frontier. Fifteen years earlier (1923), the field of musicology, as an academic vocation, was also a new discipline. Many credit Otto Kinkeldey as not only being among the first musicologists, but also, in 1937, the first to propose music librarianship, not only as field of study at the university level, but also as a full-time vocation requiring expertise on par with PhDs. By mid to late 1930s, North Texas had already acquired sizable music collections that included orchestral scores, sheet music, phonograph recordings, and a Carnegie funded reproducing unit. But concerted growth of music collections at North Texas was the culmination of (i) several national initiatives (late 1930s) and (ii) the 1938 appointment of Wilfred Bain to head its College of Music, which at that time had been a deanless School of Music. On the national level in the late 1930s, the newly formed National Association of Schools of Music, the newly formed Music Library Association, and music educators in higher education were collaborating to develop national curricular standards for music schools. Wilfred Bain, through his involvement with the NASM was part of that movement. In September 1940, Bain appointed the first North Texas music librarian, Anna Harriet Heyer (1910‚Äì2002). Heyer was a classical pianist and was among the first in the country who was formally educated at the university level specifically in the field of music librarianship. Heyer headed the Music Library for 25 years‚Äîfrom 1940 to 1965‚Äîbuilding it into a formidable music institution. Heyer's mother had been a librarian. And Heyer had been librarian for public schools in Fort Worth in the mid-1930s. But in 1937, she drew inspiration to pursue a career as a music librarian after reading a transcript of a speech delivered that same year by Kinkeldey. In that speech, he proposed standards for a music library and a curriculum for educating music librarians at American universities. This profoundly influenced Heyer who, from that point forward, devoted her life to music librarianship. Four other factors contributed to the growth in music collections at North Texas, beginning in the 1940s. One: Post World War II enrollment of music majors at North Texas grew exponentially. By 1946, the College of Music was among the largest in the country. Two: In 1950, the School began offering doctorates in musicology, composition, and theory. Three: North Texas, in 1947, was the first to offer a degree in jazz studies. The upshot was that high enrollment, diversity of music disciplines, and academic breadth and depth placed a premium on having a strong, comprehensive music library. Four: North Texas, in 1939, had been admitted into NASM, but as an associate member. Heads of music at several universities used the prospects of full institutional membership to persuade university presidents to provide more funding. In 1939, NASM, while Bain was also affiliated with its committee for academic standards, added minimum standards for a music library. In 1940, the year Heyer was hired, NASM granted North Texas full institutional membership. Kinkeldey, from September 1951 to August 1952, became a distinguished visiting professor of musicology at North Texas. In 1957, Heyer published a groundbreaking bibliography, Historical Sets, Collected Editions, and Monuments of Music: A Guide to their Contents. This reference stood for decades as one of the essential reference tools in the field of Western classical music. For comprehensive research music libraries, it became a guide for holdings. As of 2012, the Music Library houses one of the largest music collections in the United States. The library has about a half-million scores, approximately 900,000 sound recordings‚Äîand books, photographs, and odd memorabilia. = Acquisitions and special collections = The Music Library has sizable special collections in jazz, including those of Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Willis Conover, Don Gillis, Leon Breeden, and WFAA. However, enrollment of non-jazz music majors at North Texas is far greater than those majoring in jazz and collections of the Music Library proportionately reflect that. = Odds and ends = * First edition of Handel's Messiah * Early editions of operas by Louis XIV's court composer * Maynard Ferguson's handwritten score to Rocky * A collection of Elvis Presley 45 rpms for Sun Records * Autographed album of the Ramones * Postcard from composer Arnold Schoenberg * A framed page from a 700-year-old Catholic missal hangs on a wall. \\"This was written long before lined notation,\\" according to Martin. \\"There are markers over some of the words that apparently told the priest to go up or down as he sang, but we have no idea what they mean.\\" * Plaster bust of Duke Ellington sculpted by John William Heard (born 1938), acoustic jazz bassist, artist, and sculptor‚Äîno copies of it anywhere in the world * Early Edison phonographs that play the library's collection of 100 still-serviceable wax cylinders * A pair of cowboy boots, the property of Leon Breeden, who brought the UNT jazz studies program to international prominence during his tenure as director from 1959 to 1981. \\"When the jazz band toured Russia in the 1970s, Breeden wore these everywhere they went,\\" Martin said. \\"If you knew Leon Breeden, you knew he was not one to ever wear cowboy boots, so this was obviously just for show.\\" = Other acquisitions = Significant growth to Special Collections began in the 1960s, with the bequests of former faculty and alumni. * An early contributor was Julia Smith, a distinguished American composer and an alumna of the College of Music. As a teenager (circa 1920), Smith composed the North Texas alma mater, Glory to the Green and White, \\"somewhat to her later professional embarrassment.\\" She was also composer Aaron Copland's first biographer, who obtained and subsequently willed to UNT several handwritten Copland manuscripts, including his opera The Tender Land. As the North Texas Music Library grew, its reputation drew more acquisitions. Prominent musicians, composers and collectors not directly connected with the university began to include the music library in their wills. As a result, the library's trove includes the popular, the highbrow, and the quirky. * Stan Kenton bequeathed his entire orchestra library, which numbers more than 1,600 manuscripts and 700 photographsSee Stan Kenton Collection at UNT * A bequest of rare direct reel-to-reel tapes of nightclub performances by Duke Ellington * Radio interviews with virtually every rock performer of the 1950s and 1960s. * Silent-movie scores found at Dallas' Majestic Theatre * Taped reminiscences of conductor Arturo Toscanini's associates, including his chauffeur * Approximately 200,000 manuscripts and recordings that are still uncataloged. * Willis Conover (1920‚Äì1996) donated his entire collection of 22,000 recordings, as well as correspondence, memos, magazines, record catalogs, manuscripts, programs notes, photographs and books. Conover‚Äîjazz host on Voice of America‚Äîbroadcast six nights a week to an audience that, at the peak of the Cold War, was estimated to be 30 million regular listeners in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union‚Äîand as many as 100 million worldwide. When trucks of the memorabilia arrived at the Willis Library, workers unloaded one of Conover's suits, still on a hanger from the cleaners. Martin remarked, \\"We really don't know why we have it; I guess they were just loading things up from his apartment.\\" The Music Library collects and preserves monographs, reference works, periodicals, printed music, and sound recording formats. It also subscribes to electronic databases for research and music streaming. Special Collections are a particular strength of the Music Library's holdings, featuring many genres classified under Western art music and jazz, but also popular music and various sub-genres. Eight full-time librarians and about thirty full- and part-time staff also provide reference and access services for the Music Library. = Head music librarians = * 1940‚Äì1965: Anna Harriet Heyer (1910‚Äì2002)‚Äî1976: UNT Librarian Emeritus * 1966‚Äì1970: Vernon Emil Martin, Jr. (born 1929) * 1971‚Äì2013: Morris Martin (born 1943) (see Tribute Concert for Martin's 40th year as Head Music Librarian ( years ago)) * 2013‚Äì2019: Mark McKnight, PhD * 2019‚Äìpresent: Susannah Cleveland  Archives & Rare Books  = Archives = The University of North Texas Archives were established in 1975 by President C.C. Nolen to house records of enduring value of the university and to document the development of north central Texas. The Archives houses over 1,400 linear feet of processed university material and manuscript collections. The Archives also hold over 1500 oral history transcripts concerning various historical topics and approximately four hundred ledgers from selected Texas county offices. All of these collections are described under the Archives' four main divisions: University Records, Historical Manuscripts, Oral Histories, and County Records. = Rare books = The holdings of the Rare Book & Texana Collections range in age from 4,000-year-old clay tablets to items produced less than a year ago. In addition to the traditional ‚Äúbook‚Äù format, the collections also include scrolls, palm-leaf books, posters, maps, original artworks, artifacts, games, toys, printing equipment, photographs, postcards, coins, paper money, and clothing. The Rare Book Collections include concentrations in the 18th century, travel and exploration, fashion and costume history, literature, women's studies, and World's Fairs. Additional holdings include periodicals dating back to the 1700s and modern research sources in our Reference area. The Texana General Collection includes documents, history, maps, and travel and immigration. In addition, this collection houses books from the private library of the last President of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones‚Äîmany with his signature and notes. The County History Collection contains over 600 county and city histories of Texas. The Weaver Collections are The Weaver Collection of Children's and Juvenile Literature, with particular strengths in 19th century educational books, folk tales, illustrated works, etc., and the Weaver Pop-Up and Movable Books Collection, which includes pieces dating back to the beginning of the 1800s. Other items of interest include 18th century games and stereotype plates used to print the McGuffey Readers. In 2007, the Archives and Rare Books Departments of the UNT Libraries were combined into a single administrative department. Then in 2012, a physical renovation of the 4th floor of Willis Library allowed the two units to be physically merged, sharing staff spaces and a common public service point: the Judge Sarah T. Hughes Reading Room. = Black Academy of Arts and Letters = The North Texas Libraries, as of February 2015, partnered with the Black Academy of Arts and Letters, a philanthropic cultural organization based in Dallas, to serve as its official archival repository of items related to Academy Award nominees, Grammy winners, notable jazz musicians, comedians, and other performers hosted by the organization‚Äîdating back to its founding in 1977. The items include programs, posters, photos, and video recordings of performances at The Black Academy of Arts and Letters. TBAAL's offices are housed in the Downtown Dallas Convention Center Theatre Complex. The organization hosts events at the Naomi Bruton Theatre, Clarence Muse Caf√© Theatre, and James E. Kemp Art Gallery.  Government documents   Federal depository  On December 18, 1947, Librarian Arthur M. Sampley wrote to the Honorable Ed Gossett, Representative of the 13th Congressional District, requesting that the NTSTC Library be designated a federal depository library for his District and within just a few weeks the Superintendent of Documents notified President McConnell and Dr. Sampley that (as of January 20, 1948) the College Library would be officially designated a Depository for United States government publications. In accepting this designation, the Library agreed that it would \\"receive only such publications as are desired and [only as many as the Library is] capable of handling to the best interest of the public,\\" and that \\"all publications received would be available for free public use.\\" A year later, the Denton Record-Chronicle reported that in its first year as a depository the NTSTC Library had received 4,000 federal documents. Miss Pauline Ward, Documents Librarian, stated that the documents would be temporarily located in the Reference Room until additional shelf space could be secured. That \\"temporary\\" location lasted 23 years, until the Documents Collection was moved to more spacious quarters on the Third Floor of the new Willis Library building in 1971. Today the Documents Collection includes over 1 million items, in a variety of formats: print, microform, audiovisual, maps, posters, musical scores, DVDs, LPs, CD-ROMs, and \\"virtual\\" Web documents.  Designated GPO Access Gateway  In 1994, the Depository was designated an electronic Gateway for the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO) becoming the only GPO Access Gateway Library in Texas. The Gateway Project was developed during the early days of GPO Access to maximize free public availability of the resources on GPO Access through federal depository library portals. Over time, technological evolution of both the public's Internet capabilities and the capacity of the GPO Access system eliminated many of these original needs, and consequently GPO ended its formal support for the Gateway Project on September 30, 2000.  FDLP Content Partnerships Program  Foreseeing the potential preservation problems created by federal agencies' ventures into electronic publishing, UNT became the second depository library in the nation to join the Federal Depository Library Program's Content Partnership. This program attempts to ensure permanent public access to electronic federal information. As a participant, the UNT Depository Library was designated the host of the permanent online collection of the defunct Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). In 2001, the UNT Libraries received a grant to finance the creation of electronic copies of well-known ACIR print publications such as the Significant Features of Fiscal Federalism. Electronic copies of older ACIR reports are now available to scholars throughout the world via their Web page. North Texas has since expanded its Content Partnership with the Federal government to include dozens of other defunct federal agency Web sites. This electronic repository is popularly known as the CyberCemetery. In recognition of its work in this area, the UNT was designated an Affiliated Archives of the National Archives in 2006. Under this agreement, the UNT Libraries will continue to preserve and provide access to the records of defunct government Web sites, while NARA will legally accession the records as part of the Archives of the United States and will join the UNT Libraries and the GPO in ensuring the preservation of these valuable records. As of 2012, The UNT Libraries are only one of ten Affiliated Archives of NARA. Of those ten, only three are educational institutions, two of which are the U.S. Military and Naval Academies.  Texas Agency Content Partnership Program  In 2000, UNT Libraries initiated the first Texas Agency Content Partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This MOU is modeled on the GPO Content Partnership agreement, and the new agreement with the Texas Secretary of State placed the electronic backfiles of the Texas Register with UNT. UNT Libraries also received a grant to digitize the first ten volumes of Gammel's Laws of Texas and debuted the Texas Electronic Depository Library in 2003. The Texas Laws and Resolutions Archive makes available online all bills, joint resolutions, and concurrent resolutions that have been passed by the Texas Legislature from the 78th Legislative Session to the present, including those that were vetoed by the Governor. The historical collection of Texas Soil Surveys puts online all Texas county and reconnaissance soil surveys completed prior to 1950. These surveys demonstrate early scientific thought regarding soil identification and use, and the maps contained in them show many cultural features in the landscape, including businesses, churches, schools, gins, mills, and ferries.  Digital Libraries Division  The Digital Libraries Division spearheads a range of initiatives. The scope of the digitized collections covers materials of the university, other universities, local municipalities, state agencies, national records, and other institutions of interest. According to its website, the division purports to have a premier infrastructure to support the scholarly and research endeavors of faculty, staff, and students. The Digital Libraries Division is organized by two units and four sub-units:  Digital Projects Unit  The Digital Projects Unit is a nationally recognized pioneer in digital library science. The unit has four sub-units: # Digital Curation Unit # Digital Newspaper Unit # Digital Projects Lab # Software Development Unit The Digital Projects Unit oversees all digital aspects for the libraries. Through its sub-units, it performs digital imaging and archival storage of digital files. It also organizes metadata for various methods of access that include searchability and multiple indexes, some for outside-party platforms. The unit also initiates research in, and peer review of, digital preservation and access. The unit is, in many cases, the sole online provider of data of many state, national, and international organizations. Its collaborative projects include: * The Portal to Texas History * The UNT Digital Library * Cyber Cemetery‚Äîa project established in 1995 to preserve dead websites of the Federal government, inactive or removed from the internet. Part of the process of archiving these websites involves web crawling. When a website is about to expire, the government notifies North Texas, who in turn, crawls it, archives it, and formats it for unrestricted access. The Cyber Cemetery features only federal government websites. In the mid‚Äì2000s, the National Archives and Records Administration designated the Cyber Cemetery as its affiliate.  User Interfaces Unit  The User Interfaces Unit, previously known as the Multimedia Development Lab, provides web development services to the Libraries and partners both at UNT and other communities. The unit focuses on the needs of users‚Äîusability, accessibility, information architecture, content strategy, design, CMS architecture, and resource discovery.

The album was released through Island Records in May 1976. The departure of Sandy Denny, Trevor Lucas and Jerry Donahue following Rising for the Moon in 1975 left Fairport Convention reduced to Dave Swarbrick, Dave Pegg and Bruce Rowland, and contractually obliged to produce one more album for Island Records. This album was the result, and Allmusic described it as \\"listless\\". The venture was originally intended to be a solo album for Swarbrick, who later said of it: \\"Gottle O'Geer, I would like to say once and for all was not ever supposed to be a Fairport album. It was to be my solo album, and I wish, along with most other people, that it had remained that way. Chris Blackwell, who to my mind is the richest, clueless, most unscrupulous pillock it was ever my misfortune to meet, had other ideas.\\" As such, the basic line-up of Swarbrick and rhythm section was augmented by numerous guest appearances. Simon Nicol was asked to assist in sorting out the project: \\"... there was plenty on tape but it was a bit of a ragbag really. Peggy and Swarb asked me if I'd come in to engineer it for them. It was huge fun to be involved in. Island just gave us the keys and said 'turn out the lights when you leave' so there were a lot of all-night sessions in the studio.\\" The album's title comes from the reputed inability of less skilled ventriloquists to pronounce \\"bottle of beer\\".

Early Life, Family, and Education Ezra Palmer Gould was born in Boston, Massachusetts on Feb. 27, 1841 to S.L. Gould and Frances Ann Shelton Gould. He attended Harvard University, graduating in 1861, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He was married Sept. 1, 1868 to Jenny M. Stone, and had two children, Herbert Shelton and Edith Parker. Military service Shortly after his graduation, he enlisted as a private in the 24th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, and was soon promoted to the rank of corporal. His regiment participated in the Battle of New Bern, and was stationed near that community for nine months. During this time, he received news of his brother's death at Antietam. He was then commissioned as second lieutenant of the 55th Massachusetts Volunteers on Oct. 15, 1863, and subsequently commissioned as a captain with the 59th Massachusetts Volunteers. While commanding the 55th Massachusetts during the Battle of the Wilderness, he was wounded in the left arm and hand, and ultimately lost the little finger on that hand. Seminary Education and Work Upon leaving his military service in 1865, he entered Newton Theological Institution, a Baptist seminary, graduating three years later, and immediately becoming professor of New Testament Literature and Interpretation, a position which he held until 1882. In 1889, he assumed a similar position at the Protestant Episcopal Divinity School in Philadelphia, which he held for nine years, and was ordained into the Episcopal priesthood on Feb. 18, 1891.

There are two principal versions. Papi's mosaic model proposes that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. Wallraff's gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation by proposing the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. However, the evidence to suggest that pigeons use an ‚Äòolfactory map‚Äô in order to home is not conclusive. Background Homing can be defined as the ability to return to a set point from potentially anywhere on the earth's surface, including destinations that are unfamiliar. There are two criteria needed to coordinate this task, a compass sense (a sense of direction) and a map sense (a sense of location). It is the ability to return from unfamiliar locations that posed the question of what sensory cues are used to determine locational information as well as directional information. It has been proposed that the compass sense can be derived from a number of perspectives. Magnetic orientation as a mechanism for directional sense was first put forward in the 19th century. Equally, the sun could be used as a compass in order to navigate home. In 1972, however, Papi and his contemporaries reported that anosmic pigeons (Columbia livia) were severely impaired in orientation and homing performance. On the basis of their results, the hypothesis of ‚Äòolfactory navigation‚Äô was proposed. Olfactory map Two models for olfactory navigation have been proposed, Papi's ‚Äòmosaic‚Äô model and Wallraff's ‚Äògradient‚Äô model. Papi's mosaic hypothesis advocates that pigeons construct a map from the distribution of environmental odours, within a radius of 70-100 kilometres. From this information, it is possible to derive the ‚Äòhome‚Äô direction when encountering these odours at a release site. An example of associated wind-borne scents would be pine forests, coastlines and pollution from cities. It is argued that pigeons first learn to associate specific odours with particular locations during exercise and training flights. This model has the advantage that it requires the bird only to detect the presence or absence of a range of odours. Therefore, homing is viable only if the release sites are within a proximity that can provide reliable wind-borne cues, although Papi (1990), argues the utilisation of olfactory information obtained during the outward journey. Wallraff's gradient theory overcomes the problem of distance limitation via different means. It proposes the existence of long-range, stable atmospheric odour gradients. The foundation for this navigational map is a spatial representation in which two or more environmental odours have a particular intensity. Odour gradient differs along dissimilar directional axes and, therefore, the pigeon can compare the intensity of the scent at a particular location to its concentration at the home loft. This mechanism in principle could operate over vast distances, but would require the detection and interpretation of minute differences in odour concentration. However, a more poignant question is the existence of predictable odour gradients. MeteorologistsBecker & van Raden (1986). cited in deny that odour gradients, as required by this hypothesis, exist in nature. Empirical evidence The olfactory navigation hypothesis states that pigeons learn an odour map by associating smells perceived at the home loft with the directions from which they are carried by winds. Therefore, attempts to manipulate the development of that have involved changing the direction of wind, shielding birds from winds of a certain direction and exposing the pigeons to artificial odorants. The predication is that the experimental pigeons should learn an altered map and thus when released, they should fly according to their distorted perception. Such an experiment was conducted,Papi F, Ioal√© P, Fiaschi V, Benvenuti S, Baldaccini NE (1974) Olfactory navigation of pigeons: The effect of treatment with odorous air currents. J Comp Physiol 94:187‚Äì193 where two groups of pigeons were reared in separate, although identical aviaries composed of bamboo. Group one had air blown from the south containing olive oil and air from the north containing synthetic turpentine. This was reversed for group two. The pigeons were then released east of the loft; half had a drop of synthetic turpentine added to the bill, while the others were given a drop of olive oil. Pigeons from group one exposed to olive oil flew north, contrary to birds sentient to synthetic turpentine, which flew south. Consistent, but reversed results were found in group two. However, it is important to note that there has been a failure to replicate these results in other countries, such as Germany, Italy and the United States, even when considerable effort has been made to employ identical procedures. Nevertheless, further experimentsBaldaccini, NE, Benvenuti S, Fiaschi V, Ioale P, Papi F (1978) Investigation of pigeon homing by means of deflector cages. In: Schmidt-Koenig K, Keeton WT (eds) Animal migration, navigation, and homing. Springer, Berlin Heidelberg New York, pp 78‚Äì91Waldvogel JA, Benvenuti S, Keeton WT, Papi F (1978) Homing pigeon orientation influenced by deflected winds at home loft. J Comp Physiol 128:297‚Äì301 applied two different methods ‚Äì namely the placement of fans near the home coop in order to reverse wind direction and usage of deflector lofts to shift the apparent direction of the wind by 90¬∞. Deflector lofts comprised wooden or glass baffles, which deflected wind course and therefore any signature odours. Findings were that pigeons raised in such lofts oriented themselves with a magnitude of a 90¬∞ error, known as the ‚Äòdeflector loft effect‚Äô. The wind reversed experiments, too, exhibited results that favoured the olfactory hypothesis, with experimentals on average flying in the opposing direction of home, while the controls took the correct flight path, when released from the same site. In replication of the deflector loft experiments, similar findings were produced, though when anosmic pigeons where employed, they displayed the same degree of error in orientation as had previously been observed. Therefore, suggesting that the detection of odours may not have been associated with the defector loft effect. Indeed, the flight directions could simply reflect a directional response to wind experienced in the loft or by ‚Äúother non-odorous factors‚Äù, such as light reflection. Researchers support these suggestionsBang (1971) and Wenzel (1972) cited in Baker, R.R. (1984) Bird Navigation: The Solution of a Mystery. Hodder and Stoughton Educational by noting the lack of highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions in seed-eating birds such as pigeons. It could be argued, therefore, that pigeons are not dominated by olfactory landmarks when constructing a navigatory map. Conflicting evidence, however, was produced when pigeons were housed in open cages and exposed to a fan produced air current carrying the scent of benzaldehyde. When released with exposure only to the natural air during transport and at the release site, both experimentals and controls were homeward oriented. Contrary if their response were simply to wind direction. A consistent feature of the olfaction experiments is that anosmic pigeons that are released from familiar sites are essentially unaffected. Perhaps a common fault of the olfactory mosaic and gradient model of olfactory navigation is that each model is over simplistic and that they do not sufficiently take account of other cues that may be of importance. Other sensory cues The Earth's magnetic field is a potential map cue as the field varies in both strength and direction over the Earth's surface Manipulations of the ambient magnetic field are rather difficult, although Keeton (1971) and Ioal√© (1984) did report that magnets caused disorientation in pigeons when they were released under total overcast. This first indication for magnetic compass orientation in homing was later supported by other studies, which reversed the field around the head of the pigeon using battery operated coils. Though the coils had little effect in clear conditions, their effect under overcast conditions was dependent on the direction of the current. Another observation consistent with the idea of a geomagnetic map is the shift in the initial bearings of pigeons that occurs when the field increases during magnetic storms. In magnetic anomalies too, pigeons are disoriented, even under sunny conditions. The predictable 15¬∞ movement per hour of the sun from east to west, signifies its potential as a celestial compass. This is possible providing the time of day is known and is achievable by birds due to their internal biological clock. Experiments to test this hypothesis, using the migratory European starling, indicated that the direction of migration could be manipulated by reflecting the angle of the sun. This effect was reproduced using homing pigeons. Although this study is of value in demonstrating mechanisms other than olfaction in bird navigation, it does not refer to pigeons. Inconclusive evidence The fundamental question of olfaction map sense in pigeons is ‚Äòcan they smell?‚Äô Available evidence suggests that pigeons lack highly developed nasal apparatus and associated brain functions ‚Äì yet empirical evidence has shown that the homing ability of pigeons can be compromised by interfering with the olfactory environment. However, the variability in the effects of olfactory manipulations indicates that odours are not the sole cues on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues. Odour may still, however, be one of many navigational factors playing a highly variable role, though physical limitations and inconsistent findings render the olfactory hypothesis questionable.

This inbred, genetically and morphologically deficient herd of American Bison, registered as privately-owned agricultural livstock in a fenced-restricted area, were supposedly imported to California's Catalina Island in 1924 for the silent film version of Zane Grey's Western tale, The Vanishing American. However, the 1925 version of \\"The Vanishing American\\" does not contain any bison and shows no terrain that resembles Catalina, according to Jim Watson, columnist for The Catalina Islander newspaper. According to Watson, an October 6, 1938 article in The Catalina Islander attributes the bison arrival to the filming of \\"The Thundering Herd,\\" a silent film released in 1925. Over the decades, the bison herd grew to as many as 600 individuals. The population currently numbers approximately 150. Biologists found that the American Bison of Santa Catalina Island are not genuinely wild, thus also not purebred; their ancestry includes genes from the domesticated cow, as well as deformities including smaller 'dwarf' size, different length of legs, jaw length overbite, low fertility, and behavioral problems (such as punctuated walking in tight circles). The bison herd is maintained and monitored by the Catalina Island Conservancy. Since the bison are now considered naturalized immigrant animals, transported from Great Plains of the USA by train and boat, they now play a role in the cultural and economic fabric of Wrigley-family owned Santa Catalina Island Company, with profitable guided tours for paying tourists. Therefore, the Wrigley family-owned and controlled Conservancy board of directors has no plans to remove the domesticated bison from the island. Controlling the bison population, however, remains important for Catalina's overall ecological health. In the past, bison were routinely removed and sent to the mainland to auction. In 2004, the Conservancy partnered with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, the Tongva (thought to be Catalina's original inhabitants some 7,000 years ago), and the Lakota tribe on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. A hundred bison were relocated \\"home\\" to the Great Plains. In the early 21st century however, another solution was implemented. The Conservancy initiated a scientific study that determined that a herd of between 150 and 200 would be good for the bison, and ecologically sound for the island. Beginning in 2009, the herd was given animal birth control to maintain the population at around 150 animals. On Wednesday, August 26, 2015, a contract worker from American Conservation Experience was injured by a bison while working near Tower Peak on Catalina Island.

It also has the largest dubbing studios in Latin America occupying more than 10 thousand square meters. Herbert Richers was a film producer of former productions of Atlantis in the 1950s. Aware of the Hollywood studios, he was connected to Walt Disney Studios which educated him in dubbing. Bringing the knowledge gained there back to Brazil, he applied it to the movies and TV productions in Brazil. He thus dubbed many Hollywood films and TV series into Portuguese for the Brazilian audience, particularly blockbuster action movies and television series (see below).

It hosted the Danish Grand Prix between 1960 and 1962, with non-championship Formula One races in the last two years which were won by Stirling Moss and Jack Brabham. History The circuit was opened in 1955 by Businessman Paul Tholstrup as a short 670 meter track, becoming Denmark's first permanent road circuit. The layout was a banked oval, utilizing the steep sides of the old gravel pit which the circuit was built on. In 1957 the track was extended, using waste land which existed between the circuit and the rail track to the west. This created the still relatively short 1.4 kilometer grand prix circuit. Typical for this circuit, described by Stirling Moss as \\"a most peculiar raceway\\", were the banked corners and the fact that the circuit did not have a real straight. Because the track was built in an old gravel pit it looks like an amphitheater. There was also an elevation of 14 meters (45 feet) and the track was driven anticlockwise. Roskilde Ring as it is today. A pond is where the paddock once stood. The Roskilde Ring was located close to the center of Roskilde, with new residential developments surrounding the circuit. Due to the high number of complaints about the noise created, it was closed in 1969. After closing the site was turned into a park. A hotel has been built where the race control tower stood.http://forix.autosport.com/8w/roskildering.html Roskilde Ring history at forix.autosport.com References  External links  *Roskilde Ring at the racing line Motorsport venues in Denmark Danish Grand Prix Sport in Roskilde Defunct motorsport venues Sports venues completed in 1955 1955 establishments in Denmark ","title":"Roskilde Ring"},{"id":"25147743","text":"Kenneth Anderson (23 July 1875 ‚Äì 27 August 1900) was a Scottish footballer, who played as a goalkeeper for Queen's Park and Scotland.

No contract on this specification were awarded and only one Perch was built. Design and development The Parnall Perch was Parnall's response to Air Ministry specification 5/24, which called for a two-seat naval training aircraft capable of land, deck or water-based operation. It was to provide RAF advanced training, Fleet Air Arm deck landing practice and seaplane conversion experience. Many manufacturers tendered and out of these three gained orders for prototypes: Vickers, with their Vandace I, Blackburn with the Sprat and Parnall. All three aircraft were named after fish, as the Air Ministry required for Naval aircraft at the time. All used the Rolls-Royce Falcon engine, but Parnall alone decided to design a side-by-side seat aircraft, with its ease of communication between instructor and pupil. The Perch had a wooden structure covered with fabric. It had wings of equal span and constant chord with no sweep but some stagger. Horn balanced ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Perch was a two bay biplane, though the inner interplane struts were close to the fuselage. Just inboard of these struts and on each side, pairs of bracing struts linked the two forward wing spars via a connection to the fuselage centre line, with a similar connection between the rear spars. From the wings rearwards, the fuselage was flat sided, but the top was built up, with the pilots sitting with their eyes near upper wing level, where there was a cut-out in the trailing edge. Forwards the upper fuselage fell away, blending into a metal engine cowling which continued to decrease in depth. This gave the pilots an excellent view over the nose, as required particularly for deck landings. The engine was a 270 hp (200 kW) V-12 Rolls Royce Falcon III, a water-cooled unit that ran upright so that the propeller shaft was at the bottom of the fuselage, helping the forward view. Long exhaust pipes ran on either side, back beyond the trailing edge. For at least part of its life, the Perch had a large radiator between the undercarriage legs. At the rear, the fin and horn balanced rudder together were almost circular. The rudder extended to the keel, operating between the split, balanced elevators. The tailplane, to which these were hinged, was mounted on the top of the fuselage. There was a tall, V-shaped tailskid mounted just ahead of the fin leading edge. The Perch had a two-wheel, solid-axle undercarriage, mounted on oleo legs joined to the fuselage close to the leading edge of the wing and the engine bulkhead. It was braced by rearward struts. The same legs and struts were used when wheels were replaced by floats, though they were augmented with a pair of struts about two-thirds the way along the float, steeply angled back to the lower fuselage. The floats had a step close to their tip; there was no water-rudder. The Perch made its first flight from Parnall's base at Yate on 10 December 1926. The pilot was Frank Courtney, who had become their test pilot in 1925. After test flying from Yate, the Perch went to the A&AAE; at RAF Martlesham Heath on 5 April 1927, its designer Harold Bolas travelling as a passenger. After contractor's trials there, it went on later that month to the MAEE at Felixstowe for sea trials. At the end of the trials, the Vendace I was judged best to have met the specifications, but none of the competitors received a contract to build more.

Texas Tech has played its home games at Jones AT&T; Stadium in Lubbock, Texas since 1947. Texas Tech (then known as Texas Technological College) fielded its first intercollegiate football team during the 1925 season. The team was known as the \\"Matadors\\" from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. In 1932, Texas Tech joined the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, also known as the Border Conference. The school's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially in 1937 with \\"Red Raiders\\", a nickname bestowed upon them by a sportswriter impressed by their bright scarlet uniforms that remains to this today. That same year, the team won its first conference championship and was invited to the Sun Bowl. The game was played on January 1, 1938, and resulted in a 7-6 loss to the West Virginia Mountaineers. Texas Tech suffered four more bowl losses before their first postseason win in the 1952 Sun Bowl. Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won nine conference championships, the most held by a Border Conference member. In 1956, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference (SWC) but was ineligible for any title during a four- year probationary period. It gained full SWC membership and began official conference play in 1960. The Red Raiders won conference championships in 1976 and 1994. The team remained in the SWC until the conference dissolved in 1996. The university was invited and became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference.

In Communist Czechoslovakia, Initiative Z () was a nationwide program of a volunteer, community-improvement unpaid manual labor by population, which was officially recognized as volunteer work which run for several decades, mainly on the projects where the 5-year planned economy was in a substantial delay. Specific local plans with Initiative Z community-improvement projects were usually announced by a local N√°rodn√≠ v√Ωbor (\\"People's Committee\\", i.e. an elected city council-like local government administrative body). Larger projects undertaken within the Initiative Z have eventually found their place into the nationwide state plans of economic development, such as Five-Year Plans.Notice 6/1960 of the Czechoslovak Ministry of Finance and State Bank, see sections 15, 18 The work was done outside the regular work hours, very often on Saturday morning and was somehow similar to subbotniks in the Soviet Union or standard community-action or community-improvement initiatives and programs in the West.The Czechoslovak Cooperator, Issues 3-4, p. 6 Although it was meant to be entirely voluntary work, the names of volunteers and a number of worked hours were duly documented. The collaboration in the Akce Z program was de facto a kind of civil conscription, because those citizens who did not participate and their names therefore did not figure on the lists, were questioned, why they did not come to contribute and in many cases put under an unpleasant pressure by mentioning possible disadvantages such as a reduced choice with respect to future education or difficult change of employer. Those citizens who worked the most hours were publicly recognized and there was an award-system which gave those who contributed more than 50 hours in a given year a Silver Akce Z Pin and those with more than 100 hours a Golden Akce Z Pin. Many, especially young people, earned - over the years - several of these and mentioned the fact say in applications for university admission. \\"Z\\" stands for the Czech word zvelebov√°n√≠, \\"improvement\\", referring to improvement of public places. Typical activities ranged from garbage removal and planting trees to construction of some public-service facilities, such as children playgrounds, cultural centers (Kulturn√≠ domy, Houses of Culture), municipal pipelines or sewage lines, large number of grocery stores in small villages (for example grocery store Sm√≠≈°en√© Zbo≈æ√≠ in village (H≈Ørky coordinates 49.049331 N, 15.133108 E) near Nov√° Byst≈ôice) etc.. In the late 1980s when the planned economy was in the latest phase of its struggle, even technically advanced projects were attempted to be progressed by sending numbers of unskilled volunteers to help under the umbrella of Initiative Z. However, the lack of skills among volunteers often resulted in contra-productive outcome and faulty results of volunteer work, although well hidden, regularly led to even longer delays. Many participants recalled futile work be ordered upon them, for illustration having to shuffle a large heap of sand with shovels and wheelbarrows the whole day by 20 meters, just to witness it being relocated by a machine to its original location in the following working days. Under any regime always sceptical, Czech folk wit claimed that \\"Z\\" stood for zdarma, i.e., \\"without pay\\".\\"From Good King Wenceslas to the Good Soldier ≈†vejk: a dictionary of Czech Popular Culture \\", by Andrew Lawrence Roberts, , 2005, p. 1 See also *Working Saturday References Czechoslovak Socialist Republic Volunteering by country Unfree labour Economy of Czechoslovakia Labor in Czechoslovakia ","title":"Action Z"},{"id":"25147952","text":"Ennis RFC, Ennis Rugby Football Club in an amateur rugby union club based on the Drumbiggle Road in Ennis, Co.

The founding member was Michael McNeil. Players were primarily drawn from among the business community in the town. This is evidenced by the number of members who worked in one of the banks in the town. Many were also Presidents of the Past Pupils Union of St. Flannan's College. At the beginning of World War II the club temporarily disbanded and did not reform until 1952. The GAA ban on their members playing any 'garrison games' discouraged people playing rugby if they also played hurling or gaelic football. This affected the player base available to the club. An underage section was formed in 1973. In 1979 the club finally built a clubhouse after purchasing land from the Showgrounds. The clubhouse is still in place today, having had a gym added recently.
