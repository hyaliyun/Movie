The purpose is to assess the likelihood the tenant will fulfill the terms of the lease or rental agreement and will also take great care of the rental property in question. The process culminates in a decision as to whether to approve the applicant, approve the applicant conditionally (such as requiring an increased deposit or cosigner) or deny tenancy. Tenant screening process The tenant screening process typically begins when the prospective tenant (each adult applicant) completes a rental application, pays an application fee and perhaps a holding deposit. Rental applications are designed to collect personally identifying information (name, social security number and date of birth, etc.), address, employment, criminal and eviction history. A signature is generally required, attesting to the accuracy of information provided, agreeing to certain terms and conditions and authorizing procurement of a tenant screening report. Valid government issued photo identification is typically required to confirm the identity of applicants and in compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC's) identity theft Red Flags Rule. Most landlords rely on a tenant screening company to produce a tenant screening report - to compile relevant credit, public records and other information needed to adequately vet prospective tenants. Information gleaned from the application, tenant screening report and the landlord's own research is used to arrive at a decision based on landlord's rental criteria. Applicant initiated tenant screening services are beginning to emerge. Under this model, applicants order reports on themselves and grant access to prospective landlords. Tenant screening companies Tenant screening services are specialized consumer reporting agencies (CRAs) or investigative consumer reporting agencies as defined and regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1681 et seq. CRAs have many obligations under the FCRA. Notably, they must establish the identity of each end-user (landlord) and the purpose for which the information is sought - before providing a tenant screening report. ::*They must \\"follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates\\". ::*\\"Upon request, and subject to section 610(a)(1)of the FCRA (¬ß 1681h), clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer \\"all information in the consumer's file at the time of the request.\\" Failure to do so can result in strong regulatory action. See http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2010/02/saferent.shtm. ::*Additional CRA compliance procedures are outlined in Section 607 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1681e). Tenant screening reports Tenant screening reports contain one or more of the following elements: ::*Consumer credit report (with or without a score) - from one of the three national credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax or Transunion). ::*Eviction records search ::*Criminal records search ::*Sex offender registry search ::*Specially designated nationals search (frequently referred to as an OFAC search) ::*Rental references ::*Employment verifications ::*Recommendation - based on the landlord's criteria (parameters) Credit reports and database searches are often returned instantly via secure web sites. Additional information resulting from more in-depth public records searches, rental references and employment verifications can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Landlord responsibilities Landlords are Users of Consumer Reports, also as defined and regulated by the FCRA. The FCRA imposes specific requirements on landlords as Users. Notably, they must \\"‚Ä¶provide oral, written, or electronic notice of adverse action taken based in whole or in part on any information contained in a consumer (tenant screening] report. Adverse action is a determination that is adverse to the interest of the consumer. Certainly denial of tenancy is an adverse action. But so too is attaching additional terms, such as requiring an additional deposit or co-signer. The notification must include: ::*The name, address and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency (tenant screening company] that furnished the report; and ::*The consumer's right to a free copy of the tenant screening report; and ::*The consumer's right to dispute the accuracy and completeness of the report. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank) amended Section 615 of the FCRA to add a new requirement that a person (landlord) taking Adverse Action‚Ä¶ ‚Äúprovide to the consumer written or electronic disclosure (A) of a numerical credit score as defined in section 609(f)(2)(A) [of the FCRA] used by such person in taking any Adverse Action based in whole or in part on any information in a consumer report; and (B) of the information set forth in subparagraphs (B) through (E) of section 609(f)(1),‚Äù including: ::*Numerical Score ::*Score Range ::*Score Factors ::*Score Date ::*Score Source Tenant screening and the law There is a substantial body of law regulating consumer reporting. The FCRA, 15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1681 et seq. as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) and more recently by Dodd-Frank is the primary body of law regulating consumer reporting. Many states have laws regulating consumer reporting as well. Section 625 of the FCRA (15 U.S.C. ¬ß 1681t) addresses the Relation (of the FCRA) to State laws by stating that \\"‚Ä¶this title does not annul, alter, affect, or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this title from complying with the laws of any State with respect to collection, distribution, or use of any information on consumer, ‚Ä¶except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this title‚Ä¶\\". Federal law is said to pre-empt state law to the extent of any inconsistencies. Dodd- Frank transferred regulatory authority over consumer reporting (and therefore tenant screening companies) from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2011. Federal, Fair Housing Laws and Presidential Orders. and state, Example: state fair housing law. fair housing and residential landlord-tenant law impact the tenant screening process in several ways. It is, in a nutshell, a violation of fair housing law to treat protected individuals differently in the tenant screening process. Fair housing law at the federal level is found in Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Residential landlord-tenant law often limits what landlords may charge for tenant screening to the actual costs in obtaining the background information, not to exceed the customary costs charged by a screening service in the general area. Legal and legislative trends Fair housing advocates have long argued for application of the disparate impact legal theory (historically applied to employment practices) to Title VIII (Fair Housing Act) claims., National Housing Law Project (NHLP) Lawsuit Guide. They argue, for example, that people of certain races and ethnicities are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system, that use of criminal records data for tenant screening purposes has a disparate impact on those individuals and is therefore discriminatory. The debate was largely settled in 2015 when in the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs(The Department) v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.(ICP), the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed that a facially neutral business practice that has a disparate impact on a protected class can form the basis of a Fair Housing Act claim. The decision was in part based upon the Housing & Urban Development (HUD) regulation interpreting the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard - including its burden-shifting framework for adjudicating such claims., Supreme Court and Fair Housing. Landlords have a right and obligation , Charlotte Housing Authority Settlement. to take reasonable steps to protect themselves, their residents and neighbors from prospective residents with a history of violent felonies (for example). Landlords can take steps to reduce their exposure to disparate impact claims by limiting consideration to criminal convictions (versus arrests), to offenses that are relevant to the tenancy, and that occur within a reasonable period of time. Note section 605 of the FCRA prohibits CRA's from reporting records of arrest which from the date of final disposition antedate the report by more than seven years. Some states similarly limit reporting of criminal convictions - while there is no such limit in the FCRA.

History The firm was founded in New York in 1906 by Alexander Stewart Walker (1876-1952) and Leon N. Gillette (1878-1945). Originally known as Walker & Gillette, the firm designed country estates and urban townhouses for some of New York's more affluent families. Through the years, the practice expanded to include corporate interiors for prominent banking and brokerage concerns as well as major architectural commissions such as the Fuller Building at 57th Street and Madison Avenue and the First National Bank Building at 57th Street. Following Gillette's death in 1945, A. Stewart Walker merged his practice with the Office of Alfred Easton Poor. The firm practiced under the name of Walker & Poor from 1946 to 1952 with commissions that included Sotheby Parke Bernet Galleries, Chemical Bank, Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation and NATO air bases in France. After Walker's death in 1952, the firm continued the practice as the Office of Alfred Easton Poor until 1971. In 1958, the firm opened a second office in Washington, D.C. During this period, the firm expanded and diversified further into governmental facilities, office buildings, communications centers, and industrial structures throughout the United States, Europe, and South America. In 1972, the firm became known as Poor and Swanke & Partners, in 1975, Poor, Swanke, Hayden & Connell, in 1979, Swanke Hayden Connell & Partners, and in 1981, Swanke Hayden Connell Architects. During this time, the firm expanded its disciplines and became a global practice, opening offices in Miami and London in 1987, Istanbul in 1997, Sheffield 2002, Moscow in 2006, and Shanghai in 2010. In 2000, the firm acquired Taylor Clark Architects, a firm specializing in the healthcare field.

First found in the Lithuanian Chronicles, the legend shares certain similarities with the Capitoline Wolf and possibly reflected Lithuanian desire to showcase their legendary origins from the Roman Empire (see the Palemonids). The legend became popular during the era of Romantic nationalism. Today Iron Wolf is one of the symbols of Vilnius and is used by sports teams, Lithuanian military, scouting organizations, and others. Legend According to the legend, Grand Duke Gediminas (ca. 1275 ‚Äì 1341) was hunting in the sacred forest near the Valley of ≈†ventaragis, near where Vilnia River flows into the Neris River. Tired after the successful hunt of an aurochs, the Grand Duke settled in for the night. He fell soundly asleep and dreamed of a huge Iron Wolf standing on top a hill and howling as strong and loud as a hundred wolves.

Musically, it is an Albanian-language folklore-inspired ballad, which lyrically addresses an emotional circumstance reflecting the moments that occurred in the past and the expectations of insecure tomorrows. The song represented Albania in the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest in Baku, Azerbaijan, after winning the pre-selection competition Festivali i K√´ng√´s. It reached the fifth place in a field of twenty-six scoring a total of one hundred and forty six points remaining the country's highest placement to date. During her minimalistic performance, Nishliu was performing alone in front of dark-coloured LED screens featuring red and white flashing lights in the background. \\"Suus\\" received positive reviews from music critics upon its release, commending its authenticity and the singer's vocal delivery.

The singer took part with \\"Suus\\" written by Nishliu herself and composed by Florent Boshnjaku. For the purpose of the singer's Eurovision Song Contest participation, the song was remastered undergoing few structural modifications at its intro, refrain and instrumentation. It was produced at the Ocean Way and Capitol Studios in Los Angeles, and mastered at the Sterling Sound Studios in New York. Musically, the song is an Albanian-language folklore-inspired ballad. It lyrically addresses an emotional condition reflecting for the moments that occurred in the past and the expectations of unsure tomorrows.

Critical reception  Upon its release, \\"Suus\\" was received with positive reviews by music critics. William Lee Adams of Huffington Post was skeptical when he first heard the song but upon realising that Nishliu was singing \\"Qaj\\" (Cry in English), he said that \\"it really drove home the point that \\"Suus\\" is a deeply emotional ballad\\". In a Wiwibloggs review containing several reviews from individual critics, including Deban Aderemi and William Lee Adams, praise was given towards Nishliu's voice and the song's authentic nature, while Aderemi concluded that it is as an \\"absolute masterpiece\\". Chris Zammarelli from Eurovision Lemurs similarly commended the singer's \\"powerful\\" vocal delivery. Keith Watson of Metro included Nishliu's performance in its list of \\"The 'real' winners of the Eurovision Song Contest\\" and found it \\"an emotive epic performance that displays her incredible vocal range\\".  Promotion and release  An accompanying music video for the song was premiered on the official YouTube channel of the Eurovision Song Contest on 17 March 2012. Nishliu stated, \\"its a poetic video\\" in which according to her through \\"its components [...] intends to depict this life's absurd through an abstract art form\\". She further said, \\"the beautiful thing is that everyone can give its meaning to it, so this video allows a variety of interpretations\\".

Phillips served for twenty-six years as a Republican member of the Alaska House of Representatives and the Alaska Senate, from 1977 to 2003. Phillips was born in Seattle, Washington, on August 30, 1950. He came to Alaska with his family in 1956. He received a B.A. from Alaska Methodist University in 1973. He established residency in Eagle River, along the Glenn Highway north of Anchorage. He worked as a legislative aide in the 9th Alaska State Legislature before running for the House himself in 1976. He was elected to the four-member 8th District, which stretched from the Anchorage neighborhoods Mountain View and Muldoon, out the Glenn Highway to Eagle River, Chugiak and Eklutna. In his first term in the 10th Alaska State Legislature, Phillips was named Outstanding Freshman Legislator. In his second term, he was the second-youngest member of the House by only one day, being born the day after Ray Metcalfe. He served in the House until 1993; following redistricting during the 1980s, he represented the two-member 15th District, which pared his constituency down to the Chugiak and Eagle River areas. His tenure in the Alaska Senate lasted from 1993 to 2003. He said his decision to retire from the legislature was prompted by redistricting that drastically altered his district. The redistricting in question placed Phillips in District P, which reached from the eastern and southern portions of Eagle River to northeast and south Anchorage, Whittier and the northeastern Kenai Peninsula, mostly connecting through Chugach State Park. Phillips would have had to run against south Anchorage representative Con Bunde (who did win the seat and served until his retirement in 2011) in a district largely removed from his traditional constituency.Juneau Empire: \\"Randy Phillips stepping down from Senate post,\\" June 20, 2002, accessed December 29, 2011 From 1987 to 1991, Phillips was tied with fellow 15th District representative Sam Cotten as the senior member of the House. Cotten was elected to the Senate in 1990, which left Phillips as the senior member in his final term. Following the 1994 reelection defeat of Jalmar M. Kerttula, Phillips was tied with Tim Kelly from 1995 to 2001 as the senior member of the legislature. Kelly was also first elected to the House from the 8th District in 1976.

It is one of a series of Pacific Cretaceous large igneous provinces (LIPs) together with Hess Rise, Magellan Rise, and Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi. It was named for Nikolay Shatsky (1895-1960), a Soviet geologist, expert in tectonics of ancient platforms. The rise consists of three large volcanic massifs, Tamu, Ori, and Shirshov, but, in contrast, there are few traces of magmatism on the surrounding ocean floor. Tamu Massif is likely the largest volcano yet discovered on Earth. In 2016, a study found that Tamu Massif covered the entire Shatsky Rise, meaning that the volcano had a surface area of , surpassing Olympus Mons in terms of surface area. Extent and volume It covers an area that has been estimated to (roughly the size of California or Sumatra) and a volume of . Beneath Shatsky rise, however, the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity (Moho, the mantle-crust boundary) disappears at a depth of whereas it is normally observed at a depth of . Furthermore, the crustal thickness between the massifs of the Shatsky Rise is almost twice that of normal crust thickness. This considered, the area covered by the rise, assuming the crust was also formed by the Shatsky Rise volcanism, has been estimated to and the volume to . Subsidence After its formation Shatsky Rise was uplifted and it then subsided , which, in both cases, is considerably more than in the case the Ontong-Java Plateau. There was least subsidence at the centre of the Tamu Massif ( ), subsidence increased at the northern flank of the Tamu Massif and at the Ori Massif ( ), and it becomes greatest at the flank of Ori Massif. The cause of this gradual increase in subsidence can be underplating beneath Tamu Massif. There was much less subsidence at Shirshov Massif farther north ( ) which probably represents a later, different phase of volcanism. Origin controversy Scientific studies of the size, shape, and eruption rate of the Shatsky Rise have concluded that the rise originated from a mantle plume, whereas studies of magnetic lineations and plate tectonic reconstructions have shown that it must have originated near a triple junction and drifted up to during the Early Cretaceous (140‚Äì100 Ma). A 2016 study concluded that the Tamu Massif formed at a mid-ocean ridge that interacted with a plume head and that the Ori Massif formed off-axis probably from a plume tail. Shatsky Rise formed at a triple junction, but the thickness of the plateau coupled with the depth and intensity of melting is different from those of MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt), making a recycled mantle slab a more likely source. A decrease in magma volume with time is more consistent with the involvement of a mantle plume.; Tectonic history It formed during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous at the Pacific‚ÄìFarallon‚ÄìIzanagi triple junction, probably making it the oldest unaltered ocean plateau. Because this occurred before the so-called Cretaceous silent period, a long period without magnetic reversals, its formation can be precisely dated. Magnetic lineations on and surrounding Shatsky Rise range from M21 (147 Ma) at the south-western edge to M1 (124 Ma) at the northern tip. The Shatsky Rise LIP erupted at the location of the Pacific‚ÄìFarallon‚ÄìIzanagi triple junction 147‚Äì143 Ma either because a mantle plume reached the surface or because of decompression melting at a mid-ocean ridge. The eruption coincided with an , nine-stage jump in the location of the triple junction and a configuration change from ridge-ridge- ridge to ridge-ridge-transform. A set of magnetic lineations, called the Hawaiian lineations, between Shatsky Rise, Hess Rise, and the Mid-Pacific Mountains, formed during the spreading between the Pacific and Farallon plates 156‚Äì120 Ma. North of Shatsky Rise the so-called Japanese lineations are oriented in another direction and the differences in orientations trace the path of the Pacific‚ÄìFarallon‚ÄìIzanagi triple junction. The triple junction moved north-west before M22 (150 Ma) after-which it started to reorganise, a microplate formed and the triple junction made an eastward jump to the oldest part of the rise, the TAMU Massif. The remainder of Shatsky Rise formed before M3 (126 Ma) along the trace of the triple junction. Shaktsky volcanism was episodic and tied to at least nine ridge jumps from this episode. The volume of the rise decreases along the trace of the triple junction. The TAMU Massif at the southern end has an estimated volume of whereas both ORI and Shirshov (136 Ma) attained .

It exists to maintain and build a strong and successful commercial radio industry. It does this by lobbying on behalf of members for: more freedom in how and where they produce content; deregulation of commercial messages; tighter rules on the prominence of commercial brands on the BBC; and the removal of local media ownership rules. Radiocentre is a co-founder of Digital Radio UK and part of the Board, the body set-up to encourage digital switchover in the UK. It is a patron of cross-industry registered charity the Radio Academy as well as being the joint owner of the national radio ratings analyst Radio Joint Audience Research Ltd (RAJAR) and online audio player Radioplayer alongside the BBC. Background Radiocentre was established on 1 July 2006 after merging the Commercial Radio Companies Association (CRCA) with the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB). Radiocentre‚Äôs Chief Executive Siobhan Kenny was appointed in January 2014. The current non-executive Chairman is Kip Meek, he commenced the position in July 2014, having previously held a Board position as non- Executive Director. The CRCA was founded by the first radio companies under the name Association of Independent Radio Companies (AIRC) when independent radio began with LBC and Capital in 1973. It became the CRCA in 1996.Commercial radio history Since it was founded the body has always represented the interests of UK commercial radio to Government, Parliament, Ofcom, the European Commission, the European Parliament and other organisations concerned with radio and broadcasting. These functions continue to be administered under the Radiocentre name by the External Affairs department. Departments Radiocentre offers three areas of expertise each with different functions: Policy, Advertising (formerly the Radio Advertising Bureau (RAB)) and Clearance (formerly the Radio Advertising Clearance Centre (RACC)). The RAB was founded in 1992.Commercial radio history It is the marketing body for radio, funded entirely by the UK commercial radio industry. The RAB works for the commercial success of radio, raising its profile with advertisers and agencies and helping them use the medium more effectively and creatively. The Radio Advertising Clearance Centre (RACC), which since 1996 has been the UK commercial radio industry's advertising clearance body, is responsible for clearing up to 25,000 ads per year against the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising (BCAP Code) as developed by the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This regulatory code, plus nearly 60 Acts of UK Parliament, determine what can and cannot be said in all UK radio advertisements. All stations contribute to the cost via their broadcasting licence fees. Stations Radiocentre member stations together represent approximately 90% of commercial radio listening. Any commercial radio station in the UK holding a terrestrial radio broadcasting licence from Ofcom is eligible to become a station member of the Radiocentre. Subscription rates are calculated in relation to a radio company's net broadcasting revenue (NBR) figure so the smallest stations pay least. Major member groups are Global Radio and Bauer Media. Radiocentre is also responsible for running the Aerial Awards, which recognize excellence in radio advertising. The monthly award is judged by a different advertising creative every month. Radiocentre and the BBC As Radiocentre members and BBC stations make-up the majority of radio listening in the UK,RAJAR listening figures they work together in several areas to advance the interests of radio as a whole. In 1992, the two organisations founded RAJAR to operate a single audience measurement system for the radio industry.About RAJAR On 31 March 2011 Radioplayer ‚Äì a cross industry application with the backing of both organisations ‚Äì launched to bring all UK radio together in one place. Both the BBC and Radiocentre are members of the Digital Radio UK Board, and engage in ongoing discussions with the UK Government regarding digital radio switch-over. As the organisations are in direct competition, Radiocentre regularly comments on BBC policy. Much of this surrounds arguments regarding the public value Radiocentre believes the BBC has an obligation to provide. To this end, it has criticised Radio 1 and Radio 2 as not focusing on their core demographics; and Radio 5 as having an ‚Äúidentity crisis‚Äù. The most widely publicised criticism was in 2009, when it accused the BBC of breaching its own editorial guidelines through the unfair promotion of commercial entities. Radiocentre submitted official complaints that bands Coldplay and U2 and ‚ÄòHarry Potter Day‚Äô on BBC Radio 1 were given excessive product prominence by BBC Radio. These were upheld by the BBC Trust.

He was suffect consul in the second half of the year AD 19, replacing Lucius Norbanus Balbus.Attilio Degrassi, I fasti consolari dell'Impero Romano dal 30 avanti Cristo al 613 dopo Cristo (Rome, 1952), p. 8 The sortition also awarded him the proconsulate of Asia; however, Petronius is best known as having appointed legatus or governor of Syria in AD 39, probably arriving in the country late in the year. A.A. Barrett lists him as an example of the \\"excellent appointments\\" made by an emperor often dismissed as mentally unbalanced.Anthony A. Barrett, Caligula; The Corruption of Power (Guild Publishing 1989), p. 240  Governor of Syria  As Governor of all Syria Petronius was assisted by lesser officials in charge of various areas. The Prefect of Judea at this time was Marcellus who had arrived only a year earlier, and at about the same time as Petronius' appointment (Herod) Agrippa I (grandson of Herod the Great) had Galilee and Peraea added to his domains, but he was not then in the country. Sometime in the winter of AD 39/40 the Greek population of Jamnia in Judea erected an altar to the imperial cult (worship of the emperor) and the resident Jews promptly tore it down, resulting in serious communal rioting. The destruction of an altar for his own worship was apparently taken as a personal insult by Caligula who was already beset by strife between Jews and Greeks in Alexandria, both of whom had delegations in Rome seeking his adjudication. The emperor struck a counter- blow by instructing Petronius that the temple at Jerusalem should be converted into an imperial shrine with an enormous statue of the emperor in the guise of the Romans' supreme god Jupiter. The Governor was to use two of his available four legions to enforce this decree. This proposal struck at the very heart of the religion of the Jews who were an important element of the population and business sector of most cities throughout the empire (as shown in The Acts of the Apostles and attested by Roman historians). Petronius had already made a preliminary study of Jewish philosophy and so was aware of the troubles that were brewing. He ordered the construction of the statue in Sidon but told the sculptors to be in no hurry while he sought to negotiate with the Jews. He marched his two legions to Ptolomais on the border of Galilee where he was met with a massive demonstration. Leaving his army, he went on to Tiberias, capital of Galilee, where he met a high profile delegation which made it clear that they were being asked to accept the impossible. It appears that there were no overt threats of violence, though it was clearly in the wind, and the harvest (AD 40) was being neglected already, which could bring famine to Tyre and Sidon and other neighbouring areas (see Acts 12:20-24 just four years later). Petronius withdrew his forces and bought more time while he wrote to Caligula with an appeal to change his mind in view of the dangerous course that events were taking. There are various versions of what happened next. One has it that the emperor responded with fury and told Petronius to get on as ordered and followed that up with an order for him to commit suicide.Richard Gottheil, Samuel Krauss, \\"Petronius, Publius\\", Jewish Encyclopedia (1906) All agree that the one man from whom Caligula would take advice, Herod Agrippa, arrived back in Rome previously unaware of what was brewing and persuaded him to offer to rescind the temple order in exchange for Jewish promises not to interfere with the imperial cult outside of Jerusalem. In any event, the news of Caligula's assassination in January AD 41 arrived in Syria and Judea before either the suicide order or the new offer.Barrett, Caligula, pp. 188-191 Claudius became the new emperor immediately, aided by Agrippa (the Herodian family were always able to play both sides against the middle) who was rewarded with sovereignty over Judea and Samaria in addition to his existing rule, and Petronius was recalled to Rome.  Family  He was the husband of Plautia, sister of Aulus Plautius (conqueror and first governor of Britain), attested in an inscription. Syme notes that she does not appear in either the Realencyclop√§die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft or Prosopographia Imperii Romani. According to Tacitus, the daughter of Publius Petronius and Plautia, named Petronia, married Aulus Vitellius the Younger, who was during the Year of Four Emperors (AD 69) briefly emperor. They had divorced prior to that year: Tacitus states that Aulus Vitellius 'feared and hated' a man by the name of Dolabella, as he had married his divorced wife Petronia. He consequently had Dolabella put to death by the side of the road.Tacitus, Histories, ii.63. Petronius was the father, possibly by adoption, of Publius Petronius Turpilianus, who became the governor of Britain during the years AD 61-63. Tacitus in his Agricola writes that, during his governorship, Turpilianus quieted the existing troubles but took no further moves.Tacitus, Agricola ch. 16  References  1st-century Roman governors of Syria Roman governors of Syria Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Petronii 1st-century Romans ","title":"Publius Petronius"},{"id":"34221575","text":"Flensburger EC (), later called Flensburg-Harrisleer Eissportclub (1986) is a German hockey and Icesportclub.

Philip Ritte (8 January 1871 ‚Äì 14 December 1954) was a British tenor of the early 20th century. He made his stage debut in London's West End singing in Gilbert and Sullivan and other comic operas and musicals. He went on to enjoy great popularity as a concert singer of ballads during the Edwardian era and the First World War, and also as a performer in concert parties at The Oval, Margate in Kent. He made a number of recordings. Early years and personal life Philip Ritte was born in Edinburgh in 1871 as Philip Rittenberg, the son of Bernhard Rittenberg (of Lithuanian Jewish descent) and Bertha Wasserzug (of Polish Jewish descent). He was one of seven children. He was educated at Cowper Street School in London, and studied art before moving on to study music. In 1899 he married Henrietta Helena \\"Lillie\\" Latte; his profession at this time being given as that of a lithographic artist on the marriage certificate. They had four children. In 1918 he changed his name to Philip Ritte. Stage and singing career Ritte made his singing debut as a chorister with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre from June 1899 to November 1901, beginning with H.M.S. Pinafore and Trial by Jury and ending with the original production of The Emerald Isle. From 1903 to 1904 he played a small part (the First Watchman) in The Cherry Girl at the Vaudeville Theatre in London. From 1904 and for eight years he made annual appearances at the London Ballad concerts held at both the Queen's Hall and Royal Albert Hall. He performed in numerous concerts at most of the leading provincial British theatres. In 1907 he joined \\"Randall Jackson's Concert Party\\" at the Oval in Margate in which he had Hugh E. Wright, Carrie Tubb and Fred Wildon as fellow artists, and it was this association which gained him his eventual popularity. For several summers Ritte ran his own companies in the Worthing, Westgate and Swanage areas of the south coast of England. In 1912 the Ariel Grand record catalogue made the following appraisal of his career: > Since his first appearance as a member of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, > twelve years ago, Mr. Ritte's career has been an uninterrupted success. He > has appeared before enthusiastic audiences in all the principal London > concert halls and is well known in oratorio in the largest provincial > centres. Recordings In 1909 Ritte recorded fewer than ten songs for HMV's Zonophone label. Between 1910 and 1911 he made a number of recordings for Path√©. He recorded about seven discs for Beka records, and had nineteen entries in the 1912 Ariel Grand record catalogue. He also recorded for the Albion and Coliseum labels. He used the pseudonym Harold Harmsworth for some of his recordings. A selection of his songs, with recording date (where known) and record company is given below: * \\"I'll Take You Home Again, Kathleen\\", 1909, Zonophone * \\"When You and I Were Young, Maggie\\", 1909, Zonophone * \\"Love's Old Sweet Song\\", 1909, Zonophone * \\"The Golden Shore\\", 1909, Zonophone * \\"I Hear You Calling Me\\", 1910, Path√© * \\"Because\\", Albion * \\"Roses of Picardy\\", Coliseum * \\"Kathleen Mavourneen\\", Beka In 1927, he made a short film Philip Ritte and His Revellers in the short-lived DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process.

The present-day AGHS is located in Georges Township five miles south of Uniontown proper. Five hundred forty nine students were eligible for a federal free or reduced price lunch due to family poverty in 2012. School history Albert Gallatin High School was originally created in 1951, consolidating the Masontown and Point Marion high schools at the present-day AG Middle School South campus, near Point Marion. It was not until 1986 that the present building (the former Fairchance-Georges High School) was used as the sole High School for the district, combining all three (at that time) district's High Schools and creating two Middle Schools. The name was briefly changed to Tri-Valley High School, representing the changes. Finally, in 1993, the school board renamed the school to its present name, to reflect the founding father of the area, Albert Gallatin. Within 1993 and now, the school had a complete renovation and addition process, as well as technology improvements, and a new Athletic Complex, including a new fieldhouse. AYP history In 2012, Albert Gallatin High School declined to Corrective Action Level I due to ongoing low student achievement. Under the federal No Child Left Behind Act, the school administration was required to notify parents of the school's poor achievement outcomes and to offer the parent the opportunity to transfer to a successful school within the District. Additionally the school administration was required by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, to develop a School Improvement Plan to address the school's low student achievement. Under the Pennsylvania Accountability System, the school must pay for additional tutoring for struggling students. In 2011, High School remained in School Improvement level II status. The Albert Gallatin Area High School declined to School Improvement II status in 2010 due to continuing low student academic achievement. The school achieved one of 8 academic achievement assessment criteria. The high school was in School Improvement I in 2009. In 2011, the high school's 11th grade ranked 105th out of 123 western Pennsylvania high schools based on five years of results in PSSAs on: reading, math writing and three years of science. * 2010 ‚Äì 97th * 2009 ‚Äì 104th out of 123 western Pennsylvania high schools The Rankings: 11th grade, Guide to Western Pennsylvania Schools, Pittsburgh Business Times, May 15, 2009.

Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Dual enrollment The high school offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, the school district received a state grant of $16,103 for the program. SAT scores From January to June 2011, 134 Albert Gallatin students took the SAT exams. The district's Verbal Average Score was 454. The Math average score was 471. The Writing average score was 442. Pennsylvania ranked 40th among states with SAT scores: Verbal - 493, Math - 501, Writing - 479. In the United States, 1.65 million students took the exam in 2011. They averaged 497 (out of 800) verbal, 514 math and 489 in writing. School Improvement Grant The Albert Gallatin High School was awarded the School Improvement Grant, or SIG grant. The grant included some new equipment for educational purposes. It was eligible for funding due to the chronic, low achievement at the high school. In 2010, Pennsylvania received $141 million from the federal ‚ÄìUS Department of Education, to turn around its worst-performing schools. The funds were disbursed via a competitive grant program. The Pennsylvania Department of Education has identified 200 Pennsylvania schools as \\"persistently lowest achieving,\\" making them eligible for this special funding. Pennsylvania required low performing schools to apply or provide documentation about why they had not applied. The funds must be used, by the district, to turn around schools in one of four ways: school closure, restart - close the school and reopen it as a charter school. The other two options involve firing the principal. One would require at least half the faculty in a chronically poor performing school be dismissed. The second involves intensive teacher training coupled with strong curriculum revision or a longer school day.

Description and operation The apparatus consists of a gas-filled balloon envelope made from polyurethane-coated material and of a sufficient diameter and volume so that the balloon, when fully inflated and balanced with appropriate weight, almost counteracts the effects of gravity of a pilot.Farnham 1999 The Parabounce incorporates patented features that permit it to be weight balanced and quickly deflated in case of an emergency.Popular Mechanics 2000, pg 76 A parachute-style harness secures the pilot to the balloon. By pushing off the ground with his or her legs, the pilot ascends in the balloon to a maximum height of about 120 feet before gradually descending due to the positive weight of the pilot. Optional tether lines held by persons serving as the ground crew prevent the balloon from floating out of control. Once aloft, the pilot can float and glide for distances up to a quarter mile before gradually descending. In the news The Parabounce premiered on NBC's Today Show on August 9, 1999.

It is located in the final portion of the hydrographic sub-basin of the Maximiano stream which enters the cave for about 800 meters and flows into the Iporanga River. Its name derives from the size of its portico, recognized as the world's largest. Geology In accordance with measurements performed from the 1960s, but contrary to the allegation that the actual size of the entrance of the cave is 215 meters high, Gruta Casa de Pedra is part of a technical survey containing further details on the Ribeira valley cave system which will be published as soon as data from other Brazilian caves are finalized. By means of a range finder and a cyclometer, other measurements were taken in the cave for the elaboration of a detailed cross-sectional profile of the cave entrance, which revealed that Gruta Casa de Pedra's cave mouth is 172 meters high, there being a recalto on the roof of the entrance that causes the height to reach up to 175 meters, making it the largest cave mouth in the world. It has a great linear extent of 5,547 meters mapped among galleries and unevenness of 292 meters.

The submarine was laid down on 17 February 1982 at the Russian Northern Machine-Building Enterprise (Sevmash). It was commissioned into the Soviet Navy on 30 December 1985. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the submarine continued to serve in the Russian Navy. Initially known only by her hull number, in February 1999 she was renamed after the city of Yekaterinburg. Construction Construction of the nuclear submarine Ekaterinburg (K-84) began at the Northern Machinebuilding Enterprise (Sevmash) in Severodvinsk on 17 February 1982, before being commissioned into the Soviet Navy on 30 December 1985. She was the second of the seven-boat Project 667BDRM Delfin class, which was developed at the Rubin Design Bureau in September 1975. A ballistic missile submarine, she was designed primarily to carry up to 16 R-29RM Shtil (NATO designation: SS-N-23 Skiff) SLBM for use against military and industrial facilities in the case of a nuclear war. Each Shtil missile carries ten 100 kt multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles, and has a circular error probable of . She is also equipped with RPK-7 Veter (NATO designation: SS-N-16 Stallion) anti-ship missiles for use against large surface vessels, and self-defense torpedoes. Operational history After commissioning, Ekaterinburg was deployed to the base at Olenya Bay, and during the second half of 1986 underwent acoustic trials. In August 1989, Ekaterinburg conducted a failed launch of all its missile under Operation Behemoth. Four months later, in December 1989, she was the first submarine to attempt to launch all her missiles while underwater; the first launch was successful, though the second was not. In 1993, she was transferred to the base at Sayda-Guba. On 3 December 1996, Ekaterinburg entered the Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk for an overhaul, though work did not begin until March 1998. She re-entered service in 2003, based in Yagelnaya Bay. She test-fired R-29RMU Sineva missiles in December 2003 and June 2004, and during Northern Fleet exercises in August 2005 fired missiles at the Kamchatka range. Also in 2005, Ekaterinburg was awarded the Navy Commander's Prize for her missile launches. In 2006, she successfully fired missiles at the Chizha test range from the North Pole. On 20 May 2011, the boat fired the first R-29RMU2 Liner SLBM, aimed at the Kura Test Range. Drydock fire incident On 29 December 2011 around 1220 UTC, Ekaterinburg caught fire while in the floating drydock PD-50 in Murmansk, and after several hours of firefighting efforts, she was partially sunk in an effort to control the fire. Initial statements from Russian authorities indicate there were no injuries or radiation leakage, and that the vessel was not carrying any weapons as she was drydocked for repairs. The fire apparently began when sparks from welding being done on the boat's hull ignited wooden scaffolding around the ship, then spread to the flammable rubber coating covering the hull. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the repair of the submarine and a thorough investigation of the incident on 30 December 2011. The boat's hydro acoustic system was disabled in the fire. Some sources speculate that the submarine's pressure hull suffered possible structural damage due to the intense heat; the temperature inside the torpedo room allegedly rose to 60-70 ¬∞C. A commission was to study the damage to the submarine and determine whether it was economical to repair it. A Zvezdochka shipyard spokesperson said that the repairs would take more than a year. On 12 January 2012 ITAR-TASS reported that the repair of the submarine would take three to four years. The repair would be combined with a scheduled refit that was to start in 2013. As it would be some months before the submarine can be transferred to the shipyard due to winter sea ice, the repairs would begin in May‚ÄìJune, 2012, so the submarine would not be expected to return to service before 2015. On 14 February 2012, Vlast reported that the submarine had been carrying 16 R-29RM Shtil (NATO designation SS-N-23 Skiff) SLBMs, armed with four nuclear warheads in each missile, at the time of the fire, though officials had said at the time of the fire that no nuclear weapons were on board, as they had been unloaded before the fire broke out. According to Vlast, the presence of nuclear weapons on the burning vessel would have meant that \\"Russia, for a day, was on the brink of the biggest catastrophe since the time of Chernobyl.\\" Viktor Litovkin, editor-in-chief of Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye, seriously doubted that a nuclear submarine could undergo maintenance with missiles and torpedoes on board because an off-duty submarine cannot have any weapons on board due to the Russian-American Prague agreement on nuclear arms. Litovkin explains that \\"when such a submarine is in dock, all missile pits are opened so that the Americans could check from surveillance satellites that there are no missiles in them... Moscow and Washington notify each other when nuclear missile carriers are going off duty for maintenance and Russia does the same surveillance of American subs.\\" However, according to Russia‚Äôs Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, the nuclear weapons had not been unloaded before the repair work started. The submarine was handed over to the fleet after repair on 19 December 2014. Damage from a fire on the submarine exceeded a billion rubles.

It is a Grade I listed building. Structure The tower from the north-west The church was built in several phases and is constructed of local rag-stone and flint with a plain-tiled pitched roof to each section. The tower, built of randomly coursed rag-stone, was constructed in the 15th century and comprises three stages with buttressed corners and a stair turret on the north-east corner. The tower parapet and turret are battlemented and a string course above the third stage belfry windows incorporates gargoyles. The west face of the tower features a large, three-lighted window above the west door. The nave and chancel were started in the 12th century and are built mostly with random flint walls with some stone elements. The south side of the nave has three arched three-lighted perpendicular style windows. The chancel has a restored three-lighted perpendicular window and two lancet windows with a third window that was formerly a lancet, but has been modified with a flat top. The east end of the chancel was rebuilt in 1867 of knapped flint and features a tall quatrefoiled three-lighted window. The north side of the nave is flanked with the 14th- and 15th-century north aisle constructed of knapped flint with dressed stone at the, older, eastern end and coursed rag-stone at the western end. The north wall has one perpendicular three-lighted window and two reticulated three- lighted windows with a similar fourth window in the west end. A rood loft stair tower at the east end of the aisle wall abuts the wall of the north chapel which is constructed of uncoursed flints and is probably of Norman. The chapel, which is lower than the aisle, includes a three-lighted reticulated window similar to those of the aisle. Abutting the north chapel and the chancel at the east end of the church is the 15th-century vestry. Lower than both the chapel and the chancel, it is built of rag-stone blocks with flints above. The north and east walls each have two-lighted flat-topped perpendicular windows. The vestry door is on the north side. On the north side of the aisle, the north porch is 15th-century with a timber-studded gable. The church is on the Historic England Heritage at Risk Register. Interior The chancel looking towards the altar and east window The nave and north aisle are separated by an arcade of four wide bays, three dating from the 14th century and one remodelled in the 15th century. The arches between the nave and chancel, the aisle and chapel, the nave and tower and the two-bay arcade between the chancel and chapel are all 15th century. The roof of the nave is scissor-braced. The roof of the aisle has king post trusses, with those in the eastern bay being chamfered and moulded. The roof of the vestry is trussed with crown posts and the chapel has a collar rafter roof. The 19th-century chancel roof has plain trusses. Fittings include a 13th-century piscina in the south wall of the chapel, a 15th-century octagonal font, medieval stalls and very mixed panelling in the nave pews. On the south wall of the nave is a large wall painting of St. Michael weighing souls dated to around 1350. Twenty-first-century improvements to the building (completed in 2012) include the addition of a south extension housing two toilets, replacing the two sets of entrance doors (an outer green baize pair and an inner oak door) with a glass door and ramps to enable easier access for wheelchair users and those with buggies, etc. Monuments The church includes monuments to Robert Thompson (d. 1642), Henry Thompson (d. 1648), Hon. John Hamilton (d. 1714), Richard Bead (d. 1723) and Dame Alicia Colpeper (d. 1737). Other monuments in the church are dedicated to members of the Baldock, Brockwell, Codd, Dixon, Marshall and Perry families. The churchyard contains a number of Grade II listed monuments.

Williams, a left-arm fast-medium bowler, was a good enough player in his youth to have represented Rhodesian Nuffield, South African Schools and Rhodesia Country Districts by his 18th birthday. He made his first-class debut in the 1963/64 Currie Cup season, playing for Orange Free State against North Eastern Transvaal. Despite opening the bowling in each innings, he failed to take a wicket. In 1966 he appeared for Matabeleland against the touring Australian team, in a non first-class fixture. He took four first innings wickets, Bob Simpson, Bob Cowper, Ian Redpath and Keith Stackpole. This earned him a call up to the Rhodesian side to take on the same opponent and he made two further first-class appearances in the 1966/67 Currie Cup competition. He didn't play again for Rhodesia until the 1969/70 Currie Cup, when he took part in four matches. When not playing cricket, Williams worked as a farmer, in Inyati.

United States, 531 U.S. 12 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court case that concerned the definition of \\"property\\" under the federal mail fraud statute. In a unanimous decision, the Court held that \\"property\\" for the purposes of federal law did not include state video poker licences because such transactions were not a vested right or expectation. Background The federal mail fraud statute proscribes the use of the mails in furtherance of \\"any scheme or artifice to defraud\\" as illegal activity. Part of the statute indicates that such schemes relating to \\"obtaining money or property\\" by false pretenses is covered. Carl W. Cleveland was prosecuted under the statute. The state alleged Cleveland had deceived another company relating to video poker license renewals. Before trial, he unsuccessfully attempted to get the charges dismissed. A jury later found him guilty and he was sentenced to over 100 months in prison. Cleveland appealed. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that \\"property\\" did in fact include video poker licenses in the \\"hands of the state\\". After a series of appellate courts split on this issue, the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Opinion of the Court Justice Ginsburg delivered the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court which reversed the Fifth Circuit and vacated Cleveland's sentence. The basis for the decision was two-fold: first, the Court had held in a previous case that the federal mail fraud statute is \\"limited in scope to the protection of property rights\\". This meant that, taken in context of the purpose of the law, there was no intangible right for honest services in terms of the video poker licenses; therefore, there was no \\"property\\" interest. Moreover, the Court additionally found that the state interest in keeping the licenses process honest and proper would not be enough to link an economic interest to the \\"rights\\" idea contained in the federal statute.

Regarded as an eminent thinker of Bangladesh, Khan explores national and international politics and culture using Marxist and Lacanian theories. Informed and influenced by Ahmed Sofa's thoughts, his exploration of Bangladesh's politics and culture has a significant following among the country's young generation of writers and thinkers. Khan translated the works of Plato, James Rennell, Charles Baudelaire, Frantz Fanon, Dorothee S√∂lle into Bengali. In Bangladesh, he is a regular guest in talk shows on national and international political issues. Biography Born in Cox's Bazar, Khan grew up in Maheshkhali. Passing his SSC from Chittagong Cantonment High School and HSC from Chittagong College, he studied Law at the University of Dhaka. For a brief period, he was involved with the student wing of Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. In 1986, he went to the United States, and did his PhD on Theories of Central Banking in England, 1793-1877 at the New School.  Academic career  Khan taught at the University of Rajshahi from 1983 to 1984, at the Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka from 1985 to 1986, and East West University from 2001 to 2002. He was Fellow at SOAS, University of London and Stockholm University. In 2006, he joined Stamford University Bangladesh, Bangladesh as a Professor in the Department of Law.Retrieved 30 December 2011. Khan edited a periodical titled Praxis Journal from 1979 to 1986. Khan is currently the director of Centre for Advanced Theory at University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh. He is associated with a number of organisations such as Center for Asian Arts and Cultures, Ahmad Sofa RashtraSabha, etc. Writing career A proponent of anti-colonial movements, Khan has engagements in the global and regional political economy and culture from a Lacanian-Marxist perspective. A critic of Western interventionism, Salimullah Khan analyzes Western thought and discourse through critical scrutiny of the colonial and imperial legacy of the West. From this perspective, he has written on the works of Charles Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Edward Said, Aime Cesaire, Talal Asad and many others. Since 1997, his engagement with Freud and Lacan has made him use psychoanalysis to explore Bangladesh's politics and culture and also international issues. He also wrote two books on Freudo-Lacanian philosophy: Freud Porar Bhumika, and Ami Tumi She.  Critiques  Khan's first book Bangladesh: Jatiyo Obosthar Chalchitro (1983) was a critique of Abdur Razzaq's famous lecture: Bangladesh: State of the Nation. Upon publication, it came under censure of Ahmed Sofa. Salimullah Khan wrote on Lalon Shah, Ramaprasad Chanda, Jasimuddin, Roquia Sakhawat Hussain, Ahmed Sofa, Abul Hasan, Tareque Masud and some of his contemporaries. Khan views Kazi Nazrul Islam as an anti-colonial and democratic thinker cherished dearly by the people of Bengal. His book Ahmed Sofa Shanjibani provides an expansive assessment of the works of Ahmed Sofa. It established him as the leading expert on Sofa. He also edited a collection of writings by Ahmed Sofa on Rabindranath Tagore. In a 2011 debate arranged by bdnews24.com, Khan critiqued the portrayal of the Bangladesh Liberation War in the film Meherjaan.  Political views  Khan in 2018 In his book Behat Biplab, Salimullah Khan analyzed the strategic and political aspects of the liberation war of Bangladesh. In Khan's view, the three fundamental principles of the liberation war of Bangladesh are equality, human dignity, and social justice. During the Shahbagh Movement in Dhaka, Khan came forward in strong support of the war crime trial. He has intervened in recent debates on the number of martyrs in the Liberation War of Bangladesh. Khan advocates for an inclusive education system in Bangladesh. In April 2017, as the government of Bangladesh took the decision to recognize the Dawra degree of the Qawmi madrasa system, Khan hailed the decision as important for integration of Qawmi group into the national mainstream. He discussed how Islam was propagated in Bengal through the medium of Bengali language. Khan analyzes the issue of communalism and extremism from a historical perspective. and locates the origin of communalism in South Asia in the British colonial period. His analysis of communalism has also touched upon the Rohingya question, He denounced communal attacks and suggests that upholding social justice is critical to drive away communalism from the national arena. He defends equal right of all communities to observe respective religions. Proper education and guidance is critical to dissuade the young generation from going down the path of extremism.  Views on Bengali as a medium of education  Khan is a leading advocate of Bengali to be the main medium of education in the Bangladeshi academia. He opined that without establishing Bengali as the main medium of education in all stages, the decolonization process would lag behind, and the Anglocentric colonial cringe would persist in the social dynamics in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, the ruling class albeit admits Bengali to be the state language, their preference for English is apparent in their language application. Citing Freud and Lacan, he wrote that the people of the ruling class are pervert since their acts and thoughts do not reflect their words. He also called them traitors to the nation. Quoting a French proverb with puns in Bengali, he stated that until Bengali is not the medium of education in higher studies, the quality of education would stay medium, and in the realm of education, medium (quality) equals low. Compromise with the medium of language thus means the demise of quality in the domain of education, impeding progress of the nation as a whole. He also said that second languages should be taught to complement Bengali, not to supersede it. Khan is a vocal critic of certain prescriptions on Bengali orthography. In his opinion, Bangla Academy has failed to perform its duty in publication of advanced knowledge in Bengali language.  Controversy and criticism  Khan was criticized for his use of Sadhu Bhasha. His writings were labelled incomprehensible and impenetrable.  Selected Works  ;Essays * Bangladesh: Jatiya Abasthar Chalchitra (1983) * Freud Porar Bhumika, Ed.

Church, known in its early years as Indianapolis Station or the Vermont Street Church, is a historic African Methodist Episcopal Church in Indianapolis, Indiana. Organized in 1836, it is the city's oldest African- American congregation. The three-story church on West Vermont Street dates to 1869 and was added to the National Register in 1991. The surrounding neighborhood, once the heart of downtown Indianapolis's African American community, significantly changed with post-World War II urban development that included new hotels, apartments, office space, museums, and the Indiana University‚ÄìPurdue University at Indianapolis campus. In 2016 the congregation sold their deteriorating church, which will be used in a future commercial development. The congregation built a new worship center at 6417 Zionsville Road in Pike Township, Marion County, Indiana. The Bethel AME congregation has a long history of supporting the city's African American community. It is especially noted for its activities on behalf of the antislavery movement in the years before the American Civil War; its support of the Underground Railroad, which provided protection to slaves en route to Canada; and its commitment to education and community outreach. Bethel also served as the mother church to several AME congregations in Indiana and as a public meeting place in Indianapolis for social activists. Local chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Indiana State Federation of Colored Women's Clubs were organized at the Vermont Street church in the early 1900s. History Indianapolis became home to several African Methodist Episcopal Church congregations, but Bethel is the city's oldest African American congregation. Originally established in 1836 and known as Indianapolis Station, it had adopted the name of Bethel AME Church by 1869.Michelle D. Hale, \\"Bethel African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church,\\" in Origins Augustus Turner, a local barber, organized a small group of African American Methodists in 1836. The congregation's first meetings were held in Turner's log cabin on Georgia Street. A new house of worship was constructed on Georgia Street in 1841. When the congregation sought affiliation with the African Methodist Episcopal Church, William Paul Quinn, an AME circuit rider from Cincinnati, Ohio, who later became an AME bishop, was the first AME minister to serve the Indianapolis Station. Quinn also helped it achieve membership in the AME Church's Western Circuit. Elisha Weaver began serving as the church's first full-time minister in 1850. The congregation adopted the name of Bethel AME Church in the late 1860s. Although the congregation continued to expand into larger buildings and extend its outreach programs to the area's African American community, it faced financial challenges throughout its early history. Georgia Street church In 1841 the congregation had its first church built on Georgia Street between the Central Canal and Mississippi Street (present-day Senate Avenue). The Bethel AME congregation continued to use the small, frame structure until 1857, when it bought the first Christ Church building from the city's Episcopal congregation. (The Episcopal parishioners had decided to replace their wood- frame church with a new stone structure on its site on Monument Circle.) The AME congregation had the small church moved to their site on Georgia Street; however, the church was destroyed by fire in 1862.Most secondary sources report that the fire destroyed the AME congregation's Georgia Street church in 1862; however, Warren, p. 33, says it occurred in July 1864.The Christ Church building that the Bethel AME congregation purchased in 1857 was constructed on the Circle in 1838. The Gothic Revival-style structure was painted white and measured by . It had a total seating capacity of 350 people. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 413. See also: See also: It is believed that the AME congregation's open support of the abolitionist movement and the Underground Railroad, which provided protection to slaves en route to Canada, may have led some pro-slavery advocates to burn the church. The congregation raised funds and had the frame church rebuilt in 1867. The replacement structure served the congregation until its brick church on West Vermont Street was built in 1868‚Äì69. The congregation sold a lot it owned at the corner of Michigan and Tennessee Streets (present-day Capitol Avenue) for $3,000 and used the funds to purchase another lot for $5,000 on West Vermont Street that served as the site for the new church. Vermont Street church The church's West Vermont Street site, located in the northwest section of downtown Indianapolis, has historically been the heart of the African American community. The neighborhood included a mix of residential, retail, commercial, and light industry. In 1867 the congregation contracted with Adam Busch to build a new brick church on its West Vermont Street lot. The church was supposed to have cost $10,400. By 1869, when the building was only partially completed, the congregation moved into the new church at 414 West Vermont Street and adopted the name of Bethel AME Church. Bethel congregation sold or mortgaged other property it owned to complete construction of the church. The church was sold on July 24, 1880, to pay off its debts, but its new owner allowed the congregation to repurchase the property in 1891 when sufficient funds had been raised to pay off a mortgage. Subsequent mortgages on the church were paid off in 1944, 1961, and 1982.Warren, pp. 34‚Äì35. Post-World War II development and the declining nearby neighborhood caused the area to change, but the Bethel AME congregation remained in its aging church, which was renovated in 1974 in order to make more space for outreach activities. Eventually, urban development dominated the surrounding area, which included hotels, apartments, museums, and office space along the Central Canal to the east, north, and south. The sprawling IUPUI campus was established west of the church. Bethel AME Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991; at that time it was the only African-American church building in Indianapolis to receive that recognition. The state historical marker for Bethel AME Church, which is located across from the building on West Vermont Street, was dedicated on June 20, 2009, to commemorate the site that Indianapolis's oldest African-American church had occupied since 1869. =Sale and future development= In 2015 the Bethel AME congregation initiated a capital campaign to raise the $2 million to $3 million needed to repair the deteriorating building, but it proved to be unsuccessful. Without the major funding needed to proceed with the church repairs, the congregation began considering offers to buy the Vermont Street property. In early 2016 the congregation reached an agreement with SUN Development and Management Corporation, an Indianapolis-based developer, to sell the property for an undisclosed amount and relocate. SUN Development, who agreed to preserve as much of the structure as possible, planned to build a hotel on the property. Under the terms of the sale, the congregation had to vacate the property by August 2016. See also: In February 2017 Indiana University announced that its School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI had received a grant from the university to create a three-dimensional virtual reality model of the historic Vermont Street church. IUPUI students collected 3,000 images for use in the modeling project. When completed, the model will be accessible to the public through IUPUI's School of Informatics and Computing. Digital images used to create the model will be housed at the IUPUI Library; the digitized archive, along with other archival records from the church, will be held in collection of the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis. As of 2017 the congregation's website indicated it planned to erect a new church on Zionsville Road in Pike Township, Marion County, Indiana. In the interim, the church holds worship services at The Unity Center, 2163 North Illinois Street in Indianapolis. Building description The Vermont Street site originally consisted of a three-story church and an adjacent two-story parsonage that connected to the main building by an enclosed passageway. The church and parsonage date from 1867‚Äì69; the parsonage was converted to a church office at a later date. The church's four-story tower, east gable, and west cross gable were added as part of a major renovation to the church in 1894. A false fa√ßade of metal framework and stucco was added to the church's and parsonage's south fa√ßade in 1973‚Äì74. The church's original brick fa√ßade and its main entrance was partially obscured by the 1974 update; however, the building retained many features dating to its construction in 1869 and the renovation in 1894. Exterior and plan The three-story church and its square, four-story tower were constructed of red brick over a limestone foundation and contained some Romanesque Revival features. Only the northeast corner of the tower was attached to the church. The tower had paired windows on the second story, multiple round arches above the third-floor windows, and a round arch flanked by pairs of pilasters at the fourth-story level. The tower's hip roof was topped with a cross finial. The church's main entrance, facing south toward Vermont Street, had a false fa√ßade of stucco that included a single arch over the main entrance and two narrow arches on either side.The church's original south fa√ßade, now covered, had three openings on its upper and lower portions. The main entrance had a large, round arch. A gabled dormer with a large, round arched window was centered above the entry; however, it was removed as part of the 1973 alteration to the south fa√ßade. See The church's east elevation, partially obscured by the adjacent parsonage, had a cross-gabled section with tall, round-arched windows and two-story arched windows that divided into two lancets at the second-story level. The church's west elevation had vertically- aligned window openings and one doorway on the south. (Another door on the north of this elevation was enclosed.) The west elevation's second and third stories each had five, round-arched windows; its cross gable had a lunette window. The north (rear) elevation had a gabled section with two arched windows on the first story, one round-arched window on the second story, and two round-arched windows on the third floor. A hip-roofed section at the rear had an arched doorway and a window on the ground floor with a two-story arched window that divided into two round-arched lancet windows above. The rear elevation also had an exterior chimney. An adjacent, two-story parsonage east of the church was erected at the time of the church's initial construction (1867‚Äì69). The red brick parsonage connected to the church on the first and second floor and was later converted to a church office. Its gable front (the main fa√ßade facing Vermont Street) was covered with a false fa√ßade in 1974. Openings in the south fa√ßade were blocked in, probably when the false fa√ßade was added. A gable-roof porch covered the parsonage's main entry. Originally, the south elevation had arched openings with a door and two windows on the first floor and three windows on the second floor. The east elevation had a two-story gabled main section and a shed-roofed section in the rear. The main section had two windows on the first floor, one on the second; the shed-roof section had one window. Interior The church's cube-shaped interior included a sanctuary and meeting rooms; its tower housed a staircase. The church had two entrances, one on its south elevation facing Vermont Street and another in the tower. A narrow lobby across the main building had doors in the north side that lead to a meeting room. Smaller rooms were established along the west wall. The lower level included a kitchen. The main stairway to the second-floor sanctuary was accessed from the east side of the first-floor lobby. The sanctuary was remodeled in 1894 to a two-story space with the altar on the east wall. A balcony along the west wall was accessible from staircases in the sanctuary's southeast and northwest corners. Auditorium-style seating faced the altar. (This arrangement altered the original plan, which may have placed rows of pews facing an alter located on either the north or south wall.) Two tiers of windows on the west and north walls lighted the sanctuary; tall windows lit the altar. The coved ceiling was covered with beaded wood board and had a square coffer at the center. Later changes to the building included enlarging its choir loft, installation of a pipe organ and stained- glass windows, and updates to the building's heating, lighting, and electrical systems. The church's hand-carved pulpit was a gift from Reverend Andre Chambers in honor of his wife, Lettie. In 1961 pastor C. T. H. Watkins and architect Walter Exxell redesigned the church's chancel. The congregation also renovated the church building and adjoining parsonage in 1974. Window openings in the sanctuary's south wall were covered over and the related woodwork was removed due to the addition of the false fa√ßade on the exterior. The front door of the parsonage/church office led to a side staircase and hall. A first- floor room was converted to an office. In addition, smaller rooms or offices were made on the parsonage's first and second floors. Mission The Bethel AME Church elevated its role in the community as the city's black population increased. Indianapolis's African American population was small during the early decades of the nineteenth century. In 1840, shortly after the congregation organized, only 195 blacks lived in the city. Before the American Civil War, the congregation became active in the antislavery movement and supported the Underground Railroad. At that time Indianapolis's black population comprised less than three percent of the city's total population. In 1860, when Indiana's statewide population reached 1,338,710, its African American population was 11,428. However, as the war progressed, the number of blacks coming to Indianapolis from the South and Indiana's rural areas continued to rise, nearly doubling the state's African American population by 1870, a few years after the Bethel AME church was erected on Vermont Street. By 1900, shortly after the church underwent a major renovation, African Americans comprised nearly ten percent of the city's population.Emma Lou Thornbrough, \\"African-Americans,\\" in Bethel, the city's only AME congregation for thirty years, became the mother church to several congregations of the African Methodist Episcopal churches in Indiana, including the Allen Chapel, Coppin Chapel, Saint John, and Wallace (Providence) congregations.Warren, pp. 33, 35. The Bethel congregation also served in the development of the AME church. In 1854, 1859, and 1864, Bethel hosted the denomination's annual conference.Warren, pp. 32, 33, 34. In addition, it hosted an AME bishop's conference and a general conference in 1888. Education was also an important mission of the church. The congregation established its first school for African American children at the church in 1858. (Before the mid-1870s, Indianapolis's public schools did not allow African American children to enroll.) Later, the congregation operated a kindergarten at the church and a day school. The Bethel church also became a public meeting place for social activism, as well as a venue for organizing and implementing social services including providing money, clothing, and temporary lodging to African Americans immigrating to the city from the South after the Civil War. Over the years the church provided other social programs such as a credit union, counseling services, a well-baby clinic, and day-care services for children and adults. The church also served as a venue for organizing local associations that were instrumental in achieving better housing, education, and equal rights for African Americans. Local chapters of several organizations were created at Bethel, including the Indianapolis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the early 1900s and the Indiana State Federation of Colored Woman's Clubs on April 27, 1904. During the twentieth century, Bethel AME Church continued to support the city's black community living northwest of the downtown area. The congregation operated a food pantry, youth and senior citizens programs, and clothing drives, among other activities. Throughout civil rights activism of the mid- twentieth century, Bethel provided a space of racial solidarity and continued its long tradition of offering community outreach services to the city's African Americans.Bethel A.M.E.

By 1848 the small group had grown to 100 members and was meeting in a small frame church on Georgia Street. In the early 1860s, before the congregation expanded to the large brick church on West Vermont Street, the church's membership reached 120.Warren, p. 33. Over the next century the membership continued to increase. By the early 1990s the congregation had an estimated 1,200 members; however, its membership declined in subsequent decades. The congregation's membership was estimated at 120 to 150 when the West Vermont Street property was sold in 2016.

Biography Saleh was born in Pati, Central Java on 7 November 1926. He graduated from a school for native Indonesians in 1941. Four years later, he graduated from the Middle School of Agriculture, and in 1950 he graduated from high school; during high school he enrolled in the army. His first position in the army was in intelligence, serving with Third Division in Yogyakarta. In 1948, he transferred to the Ronggolawe Squad of Fifth Division in Pati and Wonosobo. After finishing his education, he switched to the legal division in 1950. Rising through the ranks, by 1964 he was mid-level officer in the investigative division. In 1967 Saleh became active in politics, serving as Cabinet Presidium Secretary from 1967 to 1968. This was followed by posts as Deputy Cabinet Secretary for Government Administration in 1972, Cabinet Secretary in 1978, and Investment Coordinating Board Chairman from 1979 to 1981. From 1976 to 1979, he also led the Antara news agency. On 9 February 1981, with the passing of Presidential Decision No. 32/M of 1981, Saleh replaced Ali Said as Prosecutor General of Indonesia; Said was made Minister of Justice. He was one of the \\"Three Punakawan\\" (a reference to the clown servants of heroes in wayang tradition) with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Mujono and Ali Said; the nickname was based on their perceived enthusiasm for upholding the law. Saleh himself was known to frequently hold surprise inspections of prosecutors' offices, later being quoted as saying \\"if we want society to be well-ordered, our law enforcement institutions must be likewise first.\\" Saleh then served as Minister of Justice from 19 March 1983 through 17 March 1993, in the Fourth and Fifth Development Cabinets. After leaving the government, he continued to write opinion pieces occasionally for national papers; his pieces were often written in retaliation to groups belittling former president Suharto. In 2004, Saleh was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was successfully treated. However, in June 2008 he suffered a relapse, and he died of cancer at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital on 21 October 2008. The viewing was held on 22 October in South Kemang, Jakarta, and attended by national figures such as President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, First Lady Ani Yudhoyono, Minister of Justice Andi Matalatta, and Prosecutor General Hendarman Supandji. Later that day, Saleh was given a military funeral in Gunung Giri Family Cemetery in Cirebon, West Java. Awards Saleh was given numerous honours, from both the Indonesian government and foreign governments. Among his awards are the Bintang Gerilya, the Bintang Mahaputra Adi Pradana, the Bintang Kartika Eka Paksi, and the Bintang Jasa Pratama from Indonesia, Commander in the Order of the Crown from Belgium, Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure from Japan, and Order of Abdulaziz al Saud Level III from Saudi Arabia. Personal life Saleh was married to Elly Djoharia. Together they had three children. Saleh was known as a fan of bonsai and suiseki.

Cars are typically highly modified exotics or restored classics and compete over seven days, traversing 3,000 to 4,000 miles. The Bullrun route changes each year but always takes place in North America. Founders The Bullrun rally and brand creators are former Investment Banker, Andy Duncan, and his cousin David Green - both originally from the United Kingdom. They were originally involved with the Gumball 3000 car rally in Europe and moved to the US to set up the Bullrun rally as a USA based annual event. They created a successful spin off TV show based on the rally and were executive producers of both the Bullrun Reality Show and the documentary version of the rally Cops, Cars and Superstars that has been shown on TV networks in 80 countries around the world. They also produced Inside West Coast Customs and Andy Duncan has produced multiple TV shows for Discovery Channel since 2015. David Green currently hosts ITV coverage of Glorious Goodwood in the UK. History Team Exotic Rally's 2011 Navigator Award Winning Nissan GTR The Bullrun rally first started in June 2004 and ran from Hollywood, CA to Miami, Fla. This first event attracted multiple celebrities, 100 plus super cars from all over the world and global media attention. Drivers enter the rally by invite only with entry fees being as much as $20,000 per car depending on the rally event. After the success of the first rally its momentum built up to the point in 2007 when the rally owners created and produced on Spike TV a spin-off TV series Bullrun Reality Show based on the live rally event. Subsequent seasons of the spin off reality TV show version of the rally were produced for Speed Channel. On the formatted reality show version of the rally on Spike TV, speeders were disqualified unlike the live rally events. Arrests Penalties for speeding on the rally are legendary with traffic ticket fines reaching up to $10,000 for individual offences. Arrests were common occurrences amongst the drivers, on average a driver went to jail every day of each event. The rally often became a cat and mouse game each year between the drivers trying to evade detection and the police trying to 'catch a Bullrunner'. The police across the USA have implemented road blocks, issued APBs for the rally owners, used helicopters and arrested drivers en masse in an attempt to stop the rally.

Many original members of Bullrun have gone on to TV shows and or national notoriety, including Richard Rawlings and Aaron Kaufman from Fast N' Loud on Discovery Channel, Bill Wu from the Bullrun Reality TV Show and One Car Too Far also on Discovery Channel. Bullrunner Ed Bolian is also a former NY to Los Angeles Cannonball driving record holder. Previous Bullrunners Richard Rawlings and Dennis Collins were prior holders of the Cannonball Record having split from the start of a Bullrun rally that started in New York in 2006 to take on the record. They had had a $50,000 bet the night before a bullrun party they could not break the record. Bullrunner Alex Roy, author of The Driver, also held the Cannonball Record and had a much publicized dispute with Richard Rawlings over who the real record holder was.

In his old age, he decided to give the war a Native American perspective. From their meeting in 1907 till his death in 1935, Yellow Wolf talked annually to Lucullus Virgil McWhorter, who wrote a book for him, Yellow Wolf: His Own Story. He is notable as one of the few members of the defeated Nez Perce to talk openly to strangers and tell their story to the world. Others of his tribe said he was making a fool of himself for talking to a white man, saying that the children of the tribe would tell the story. In spite of that, he continued to work with McWhorter. In telling the native's side he said, \\"I am telling my story that all may know the war we did not want. War is made to take something that is not your own.\\" He was concerned that the next generation of Native Americans would continue to suffer under white oppression, and wrote to help them. He said, \\"the young generation behind me, for them I tell the story. It is for them! I want the next generation of whites to know and treat the Indian as themselves.\\" His message to the world Yellow Wolf's perspective on how the Nez Perce War began In his interviews with McWhorter, Yellow Wolf makes it clear that there was increasing pressure placed upon the Native Americans as thousands of white men invaded the Wallowa Valley, especially after the beginning of a gold rush. During that time, Native Americans were being killed by incoming white people, without consequence. They were being hanged and threatened with violence if they didn't give in to settlers' demands for land. The elders in the tribe were trying to take a non-violent route, attempting to keep their people from retaliating. In addition to that, the representatives of the U.S. government who came to talk to them seemed to be going out of their way to be insulting, or at least took no effort to understand cultural sensitivities. It was against native tradition to use threats or force (called \\"showing the rifle\\") during peace talks, which is exactly what General Oliver O. Howard did. He went beyond threats and had another leader, Toohoolhoolzote, locked up because he would not obey. Yellow Wolf said, \\"That was what brought war, the arrest of this chief and showing us the rifle!\\" In spite of this the rest of the Nez Perce leaders at the council still tried to hold the peace, but some of the younger generation took matters into their own hands. A young man, Wahlitits had earlier lost his father to a white man who coveted his land. He had held off revenge because of his father's last wishes. But after the insult by General Howard, he got two cousins, Sarpsis Ilppilp (Red Moccasin Tops) and Wetyetmas Wahyakt (Swan Necklace) to help him kill that man. Unable to find him, they killed another instead. This was the last straw between the two sides, and led to the Nez Perce fleeing their home and the army. Yellow Wolf's people considered the war on them to be unjust. In his book, Yellow Wolf makes it clear that his group did not agree to the treaty that was put upon them by \\"armed enforcement.\\" The Nez Perce tribes were not unified, and that just because some of them had signed the \\"thief treaty\\" did not mean they spoke for everyone. There were also rifts in the tribe, Christian versus non-Christian. The government was talking to those that they found cooperative, and acting as if these natives spoke for all. And they fled. Family Before 1877 Yellow Wolf was in his early 20s when he joined the band in its 1877 flight for Canada. Written records don't indicate he was married or had children before then. On the reservation, child mortality, death and divorce Lucullus Virgil McWhorter's ranch in Yakima, Washington, in October 1908. Federal and Indian Affairs census records have recorded the story of Yellow Wolf's family on the Colville Reservation. In 1910, the U.S. Federal Census asked Yellow Wolf to tell about his family, and he said he had married twice (the second for 17 years by that date) and had 9 children (of whom only two were living at that date). By the time of his death in 1935, he told McWhorter that only one of his children was alive, his son Billy. He was married to a Nez Perce woman named Pe-Tol-Von-nan-Ick, who was known in English as Helen. They were listed together in the 1890, 1892 and 1893 censuses, and she was gone by the 1905 census. It is not recorded whether she died or they left each other. They had a son, Te-Yoh-Yoh-Shin (Billy Yellow Wolf) who was born in 1888. A woman, Chick-A-Moh-Peo (Jean), listed as mother lived with them, in her 80s. Yellow Wolf had another wife by 1905, I-O- To-ton-My (Little Mountain Woman), and they had a son together who would have been born in 1901. She was eight years younger than Yellow Wolf. They lived with the two sons in the 1906, 1906 and 1910 censuses. The census lists a 1-year-old daughter in 1905, Epu-tepkoset who did not live until 1906. His son Billy lived with the family off-and-on over the years. He was widowed at age of 21, with a son, and married at least two more times by 1916. Billy's child did not survive; neither did his next son. Last child When Yellow Wolf died in 1935, his son Billy Yellow Wolf was his last living child. Yellow Wolf's younger son, Jasper, died in 1921, and all his daughters died before he did. What he taught about Nez Perce culture Yellow Wolf, 1877 Names Nez Perce warriors were not limited to one name. The warriors in his tribe all had at least two names, some more. Some were serious names, some nicknames. Their names changed throughout their lives. Yellow Wolf did not want to talk about the names of his childhood, because he was limiting focus to his adult life. But in talking about them, he revealed that switching names was something one did, one found a name that fit. Some names were given to you, some were inherited. He had an inherited name, Inneecheekoostin (no translation). Another of Yellow Wolf's warrior names was Pahkar Tamkikeechet (Five Times Looking Through, or Fifteen Lightnings). Yellow Wolf admitted to going by two names, of which Yellow Wolf was not the one he preferred. The name came out of a vision, but it was also one that white men called him. The Yellow Wolf was a wyakin for him. He talked to McWhorter, about his vision quest as a boy of 13. In it, he saw a vision of a yellow wolf. \\"It was a Spirit of a wolf that appeared to me. Yellow like in color, it sort of floated in the air. Like a human being it talked to me, and gave me its power...That was how I got named Yellow Wolf. Named for that vision-wolf appearing to me. It was yellow-colored, and gave me the power of the wolf.\\" But even though he went by the name, he said that Yellow Wolf was not what he was normally called among his people. He was known more for that among whites. \\"The whites call me Yellow Wolf, but I take that as a nick-name. My true name is different, and is after the Spirit which gave me promise of its power as a warrior. I am Heinmot Hihhih, which means White Thunder (or White Lightning). Yellow Wolf is not my own chosen name.\\" His other prominent name, Heinmot Hihhih, was also connected to his spirituality. Thunder is made to kill as it strikes and rolls along. \\"My kopluts [war club] I made when a boy, by directions of the Spirit that gave me promise of warrior power. It has the same killing strength as thunder.\\" Both names went into who he was. As a warrior, he was irresistible like thunder, but also had the incredible fighting qualities of a wolf. Spelling The Nez Perce language was not a written language, and attempts to write it down produced a variety of spellings. Spellings are an attempt to use the English alphabet to spell native words. The problem with this is that native words use consonant sounds that English does not have. Yellow Wolf's native name was spelled He-Men-Mox-Mox, He-Min-Mox-Mox in the census records. In McWhorter's book it was Hemeneme Moxmox. Elsewhere it has been He-men Moxmox. His other name (White Lightning) was rendered In-mat-hia-hia and Heinmot Hihhih. His second wife's name also illustrates the difficulty spelling. It has been spelled Ayatootonmi and I-o-tu-ton-my. Their son Jasper's native name has been spelled A-last-Sauked and Elots-on-se. Religion and attitude toward violence In 1877, there was a religious rift within the Nez Perce community. Parts of the people had converted to Christianity - these were settled onto the Lapwai Reservation. Others including Yellow Wolf, who settled on the Colville Reservation, followed their native religion, which McWhorter called the \\"Dreamer Faith\\". In Yellow Wolf's words, \\"We believed in our own Hunyewat [God, or Deity], We had our own Ahkunkenekoo [Land Above]. Huyewat gives us food, clothing, everything. The native faith included a perception that the things around them (animals, trees, rocks, wind, sky) had spirits. They didn't worship the spirits, but developed relationships with them, called Wyakin, in which the spirits would guide them and lend them their spirit qualities in time of need. Yellow Wolf attributed his success in the Nez Perce War to his Wyakin, which was strong. One of the effects of the Dreamer Faith on Yellow Wolf's tribe was to adopt pacifist methods to dealing with force. Yellow Wolf speaks of the tribal leaders refusal to use violence to deal with the white soldiers. Even using threats of force was taboo with them, and it led to Toohoolhoolzote being locked up for passive resistance during a counsel with General Howard. Not all of the tribe held to these beliefs, and violence erupted, leading to the Nez Perce War of 1877. Their non-violent struggle ultimately became a flight from the US Army, and then a war; as McWhorter said in Yellow Wolf's book, \\"Every warrior interviewed on the subject testified to his advocacy for peace; but after the irretrievable step had been taken, he promptly took up the rifle.\\" His legacy, peacemaker By the time of his 1935 death, Yellow Wolf had come to be known among some members of white society as a peacemaker. His obituary in the Spokane Daily Chronicle said he had been friendly to his white neighbors, and that he was \\"not an enemy of the white man\\". He told McWhorter that he looked at how people treated him: \\"I am glad we get along so well. It is the way I have been with everyone who treats me right. I like good people.\\" References  External links  *The biography of Yellow Wolf, Yellow Wolf:His Own Story digitized and online. *Picture of Yellow Wolf's wife Ayatootonmi and son Jasper, taken about 1908 on McWhorter's ranch.

The current oath, based on the United States Oath of Allegiance, was first enshrined in Commonwealth Act No. 473, the Revised Naturalization Law of 1939, with the modern version enshrined in Republic Act No. 9225, the Citizenship Retention and Re-acquisition Act of 2003. History and composition Prior to the promulgation of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, residents of the Philippines were considered nationals of the United States, and naturalization was governed by Act No. 2927, the Naturalization Law, passed by the Philippine Legislature. However, with the passage of the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act in 1934, national status for residents of the Philippines was revoked in preparation for the islands' independence, and the question of nationality was passed on to the then-newly formed Commonwealth government inaugurated in 1935. Pursuant to Article IV of the 1935 Constitution, the National Assembly of the Philippines passed Commonwealth Act No. 473, the Revised Naturalization Law of 1939, which provided a mechanism for the acquisition of Filipino nationality by naturalization. Under Section 14 of the Law, prior to the issuance of a certificate of naturalization, the person petitioning to be granted Filipino citizenship had to recite the following oath in open court: With the independence of the Philippines on July 4, 1946, the oath was modified to remove references to the Commonwealth and the United States, although the language remained virtually the same as the original until 2003, when the Philippines legalized multiple citizenship and it no longer became mandatory to renounce foreign citizenship to obtain Filipino citizenship. These modifications were subsequently codified in Section 3 of Republic Act No. 9225, which mandates that former Filipino citizens reacquiring Filipino citizenship take an oath of allegiance to the Republic. The oath in its current form is as follows: Instead of the oath, a petitioner may choose to recite an affirmation of allegiance instead if religious or personal reasons so require.

It is about 90 km from Jabalpur and about 56 km from Sagar. It is a potential site for the Cheetah Reintroduction in India. The cheetah prey density were reasonable and based on current prey density the area could support about 25 cheetahs. 750 km2 area was recommended by relocation of 23 villages. After relocating the species, the site could support over 50 cheetahs and Nauradehi could harbour over 70 individuals. The wildlife refuge is divided into six ranges: * Mohli Range, * Singpur Range, * Jhapan Range, * Sarra Range, * D'Gaon Range, * Nauradehi RangeNoradehi Wildlife Sanctuary History This forest area was made a sanctuary in 1975.

It used to serve as the official residence of the Crown Prince of Denmark but now houses the National Museum of Denmark. History The Michelbecker House The original house was built in 1684 by Gysbert Wigand Michelbecker. Born in Marburg, he had settled in Copenhagen in 1657 and built a successful career as a merchant and ship owner. In 1685 the first reformed church in Copenhagen opened in his house. Michelbecker died in 1692 and in 1707 his house was taken over by his son-in-law Wilhelm Edinger. In 1716 it was put at the disposal of Tsar Peter the Great during his visit to Copenhagen. A princely residence Krieger's plan of the garden from 1728 An elevation of the print mansion from Lauritz de Thurah's Den Danske Vitruvius published in 1746 The mansion in 1757 In 1725 Edinger sold the house to King Frederick IV who transformed it into a residence for Crown Prince Christian (VI) with the assistance of the architect Johan Cornelius Krieger. After King Christian V's ascent to the throne, the Prince's Mansion was taken over by Crown Prince Frederick (V). He completely altered the building from 1743 to 1744 with the assistance of Royal Master Builder Niels Eigtved. In 1757 Lauritz de Thurah, Eigtved's successor as Court Architect, carried out a minor expansion of the complex on the corner of Frederiksholms Kanal and Stormgade. Other residents Later in the century the royal family discontinued their use of the property and instead it came into use for other purposes, mostly as a residence for artists, courtiers and other peers with close ties to the court. The mansion in c. 1800 For a while, the painters Jens Juel and Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard both had their studios in the building. The latter also had his home there from 1779 until 1787 and so did Court Painter Vigilius Eriksen, who lived there from 1774 until 1782, and Professor Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard who lived there from 1779 until 1787. Geographer and explorer Carsten Niebuhr, who had returned to Copenhagen as the only surviving member of the Danish Arabia Expedition in 1768, lived there from 1773 until 1778 when he accepted a position in the civil service of Danish Holstein. Among the statesmen who lived there were Foreign Minister Adolph Sigfried von der Osten and Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg who became de facto prime minister after Struense's fall and lived there until his own fall as a result of the 1784 coup d'√©tat. After the turn of the century, the residents included Royal Master Builder Christian Frederik Hansen who lived there from 1805 until 1834 while working on such projects as the construction of the new Copenhagen City Hall and the rebuilding of Church of Our Lady and Christiansborg Palace. Gerhard Christoph von Krogh, the military officer who had led the Danish troops in the Battle of Isted, was a resident from 1817 until 1853. A temporary home for the Supreme Court Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen painted by Johan Vilhelm Gertner in 1849 The fire of the first Christiansborg in 1794 did not only leave the royal family but also the Supreme Court of Denmark homeless and it found a new home at the Prince's Mansion. In 1830 it was given a new Assembly Hall at the second Christiansborg Palace but the daily administration remained at the mansion until 1864. State ownership After the adoption of the new Constitution in 1849, the Prince's Mansion was ceded to the Danish State. The building then came to serve as a \\"home for the National Collections\\". These included the Museum of Ethnology which opened in 1849, the Royal Cabinet of Coins and Medals and the Museum of Nordic Antiquities. The latter two were headed by the historian Christian J√ºrgensen Thomsen who also resided in the building from 1851 until his death in 1865. The Museum of Nordic Antiquities eventually developed into the National Museum which opened in the Prince's Mansion in 1892. Architecture The gallery facing Frederiksholms Kanal The Prince's Mansion is one of the earliest Rococo buildings in Copenhagen. It has three wings with a courtyard closed to Frederiksholms Kanal by a single-story gallery with an entrance gate in the middle. The gallery is topped by a balustrade with vases and statues. The statues together with window decorations on the garden side were saved from Krieger's building from 1726. The original symmetry of Eigtved's complex has been changed by the later alterations of other architects which has increased the north wing to ten bays while the south wing still only consists of three bays. The expansion with the colonnade visible to the right Mogens Clemmensen and Arne Nystr√∏m expanded the museum from 1929 to 1938, adding a large new four-winged building on the rear of the original mansion as well as a more narrow connecting wing between the new and old buildings which create a courtyard space open toward Ny Vestergade. On the opposite (Stormgade) side, they created a colonnade along the entire length of the complex, from Vester Voldgade to Frederiksholms Kanal. It has 38 columns of granite from the island of Bornholm. The colonnade on Stormgade The latest alterations of the building took place in 1992 to the design of Gehrdt Bornebusch. He covered the interior courtyard of the connecting wing with a glass roof, transforming it into a central lobby entered through the museum's new main entrance located in the recessed section of the facade toward Ny Vestergade. The Prince's Mansion today The Prince's Mansion still houses the principal department of the National Museum. Facilities also include a restaurant and a cinema.

It is sometimes synonymous with \\"ignorance\\" (avidyƒÅ). Moha, along with Raga (greed, sensual attachment) and Dvesha (aversion, hate) are unskillful roots that lead to Tanha (craving) in the Buddhist thought, which is part of the Twelve Nidanas that propel the wheel of life. It is symbolically present as the pig in the center of Tibetan bhavachakra drawings. Moha is identified in the following contexts within the Buddhist teachings: * One of the three poisons within the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. * One of the three unwholesome roots within the Theravada Buddhist tradition * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings Etymology and meaning Moha appears in the Vedic literature, and has roots in early Vedic word mogha which means \\"empty, unreal, vain, useless, foolish\\". The term, as well as the three defects concept appears in the ancient texts of Jainism and some schools of Hinduism such as Nyaya, in their respective discussion of the theory of rebirths. The term means \\"delusion, confusion, dullness\\". The opposite of Moha is Prajna (insight, wisdom). Beliefs different from those considered as insights in Buddhism, are forms of delusions or Moha in Buddhism. Moha is one of the roots of evil, in the Buddhist belief. Application Within the Mahayana tradition, moha is classified as one of the three poisons, which are considered to be the root cause of suffering. In the Mahayana tradition, moha is considered to be a subcategory of avidyƒÅ. Whereas avidyƒÅ is defined as a fundamental ignorance, moha is defined as an ignorance of cause and effect or of reality that accompanies only destructive states of mind or behavior.Berzin, Alexander. Berzin Archives, Glossary of Buddhist Terms Moha is sometimes replaced by avidyƒÅ in lists of the three poisons. In contemporary explanations of the three poisons, teachers are likely to emphasize the fundamental ignorance of avidyƒÅ rather than moha.

Sonic Reality. Retrieved 27 April 2014. The company is headquartered in Miami, Florida. History In the early 1990s, Dave Kerzner began collecting rare musical instruments and vintage keyboards from the 1960s and 1970s. When 16-bit stereo digital sampling became available, Kerzner began to create samples of those instruments in order to license to musical instrument companies. Companies such as Alesis, Yamaha and Roland used the sampling in their sound libraries, expansion boards, electronic keyboards and drum modules. The result was the first vintage instrument sample library, created by Kerzner in 1991 and known as \\"Vintage Keyboards and Classic Synths\\". In 1996, Kerzner founded Sonic Reality. Through his company, Kerzner made available many of his preferred sounds to the music industry in the form of CD ROMs in order for musicians to access the sampled sounds from his collection of instruments. In 1999, Sonic Reality worked with Ilio Entertainment to distribute these sample collections to a number of keyboard manufacturers including Akai, Roland, Kurzweil, Digidesign, Emu.Sonic Reality Sample Libraries.

While developing music technology and creative tools for musicians, Kerzner collaborated with professional artists to sample and digitally reproduce the sounds of many types of musical instruments. The sounds are played from music software such as samplers and other music recording tools.

It was commissioned for the Northwest Chamber Orchestra by Charles and Diana Carey and published by Dunvagen Music. Glass wrote the concerto with the Baroque tradition in mind; however, in order to approach the work in a modern idiom, he calls for a contemporary chamber orchestra to accompany the harpsichord. The concerto was premiered in September 2002 in Seattle, with David Schrader as soloist performing with the Northwest Chamber Orchestra. It is approximately 20 minutes in length.www.chesternovello.com/works/Philip_Glass:_Concerto_for_Harpsichord_and_Orchestra The concerto was included in Glass' Concerto Project, a collection in four volumes. Instrumentation This concerto calls for a relatively small chamber orchestra:www.chesternovello.com/harpsichord_concerto_orchestration *one flute, two oboes, one bassoon *two horns in F *Strings: violin I, violin II, viola, cello, double bass *Solo Harpsichord Structure The work is written in the standard three movement concerto format, with a typical fast- slow-fast progression.  First Movement  The concerto opens on a scale and long trill played by the harpsichord, which first seems to resemble Bach before turning decisively into a recognizably Glass-style configuration of triplets. The orchestra is low at this point, and after perhaps forty seconds, enters the scene with short bursts which aid the harpsichord's rapid spins. The movement slows somewhat into a more lyrical second section, dominated by strings. Soon after horns play quietly, allowing for the soloist to reenter. After a period of development the movement, eight minutes in duration, recalls the Bach-like theme introduced at first, and draws to a close.  Second Movement  The slower, ten-minute second movement begins with a simple repetitive rhythm by the harpsichord, which after a short duration leads into a lyrical neo-Baroque theme. A brief development ensues. This is followed by a broad statement from the brass, after which the strings and winds introduce the second theme. The statement is repeated after a tremulous harpsichord interlude. Soon afterwards the harpsichord further develops its opening material; it is later joined by the strings, who present a fluctuating, minimalist theme which continues beneath. After a period of approximately two minutes, flutes, bassoon and oboe begin a varied, lengthy partnership while the strings and harpsichord provide a gentle pulse. After a recapitulation of the second theme, the movement draws to a close with a return to the introductory passages.  Third Movement  The final movement begins with an ecstatic blast from the orchestra, a rapid, major-key theme repeated afterward by the harpsichord. This is followed by playful exchanges between the soloist and the winds; afterward, the strings engage in a complex cycle of triplets with accompaniment by the brass. Rich in counterpoint, this section gives way to a further spiral of brass, with auxiliary support from the harpsichord. The concerto closes in a Haydnesque variation, concluding on a powerful four-note motif Glass also uses to conclude his Cello Concerto No. 1 and his Tirol Piano Concerto. It is probable that Glass was inspired by Rachmaninoff's signature concerto ending, also consisting of four rapid notes. Analysis  Departure from minimalism  Although Philip Glass has, albeit controversially, often been labeled as minimalist, the composer dislikes this terminology. This composition is an indication of Glass' recent turn from this label. Evident in his later work is a direction in a more \\"classical\\" path; other examples include the Tirol Concerto, the First Cello Concerto, and the Second Piano Concerto. Despite many residual minimalist characteristics throughout the work, such as repetitive triplets and relatively constant pulse, the concerto is tremendously varied, especially in the second movement. Themes are not restated at a noticeably increased amount, and tend to be clustered in groups of two (not unlike the thematic structure of symphonic work by Mozart or Haydn). Glass also concludes in a strong major key, a stylistic decision avoided in many of his earlier pieces.  Neo- Baroque  This concerto is audibly influenced by the Baroque, a period Glass studied extensively while a student and one from whose repertoire he has often performed. In the opening movement, Glass tips his head to Bach, whose harpsichord concertos are a noted reference in this piece's composition. In addition, the middle movement sponsors a fluid introductory theme which again echoes Bach and perhaps Handel. The closing movement is almost Mozartian in nature, another nod to tradition. Performances The work was premiered on September 21, 2002, in Seattle's Benaroya Hall. The soloist was Jillon Stoppels Dupree. The work was included in Volume II of Philip Glass's The Concerto Project *2002: Jillon Stoppels Dupree (Harpsichord) and Ralf Goth√≥ni (with Northwest Chamber Orchestra), recorded 2006, released 2006 on The Concerto Project Vol. II (Orange Mountain Music) as \\"Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra\\" (19:32). *2011: Elliot Figg (Harpsichord) and Joel Sachs November 8, 2010 with the New Juilliard Ensemble, New York. *2012: Christopher D.

Park Geun-hye, the party‚Äôs leading presidential candidate, Lee Jun-seok is the youngest ever to hold a leadership position in the history of the conservative ruling party. Being a part of the Leadership Council, Lee's role was to make key decisions on behalf of the party, including the selection of candidates to run in the parliamentary elections in April. Pundits view the appointment to appeal to the younger demographic and counter the surging popularity of Ahn Cheol-soo.GNP's New Leadership Holds First Official Meeting; DUP Pledge to Achieve Fair Elections Lee's background in computer science and a track record of public service resemble those of Ahn and some see that as the reason for the appointment. Lee remained as a member of Saenuri Party after Park Geun-hye became the President of South Korea.  21st general election  Even though he won the main vote for the third time in the 21st general election to win the Nowon-gu disease, he was persuaded by those who lost the pre-voting, which recorded the highest voter turnout ever, and claimed that he would not be swayed by YouTube's conservatives, but rather reform the conservatives. As the controversy over the manipulation continued despite the discussion on the YouTube channel Pen & Mike, which was held on the condition of 1 million won in sponsorship to the Cheonan Foundation, on April 28, he said, \\"If there is no manipulation after recounting, I will have all the YouTube channels transferred to me and if there is any manipulation, I will resign from politics.\\" After corruption scandal in 2016 During 2016 South Korean political scandal, Lee harshly criticized the former president Park Geun-hye, whom Lee supported at 18th presidential election. Lee quit Saenuri Party (currently renamed as Liberty Korea Party) and joined Bareun Party with conservative lawmakers who had opposed Park. Controversies Lee's background and comments have been reported heavily in the Korean media upon his appointment. Recently he asked the host of \\"I'm a Weasel\\", a progressive and popular podcast for political satire and criticism of the conservative Grand National Party, for help to investigate the political scandal that is plaguing the Grand National Party. Kang Yong-suk, a national assemblyman made some attacks on Junseok Lee's qualifications. The critics of the Grand National Party argue that Junseok Lee's old Tweets show his indifference to the average Korean and that he belongs to the upper elite as his Harvard education shows.

The S-Motors hold the distinction of being the world's first mass-produced main line electric locomotives with the prototype #6000 being constructed in 1904. The S-Motors would serve alone until the more powerful T-motors began to arrive in 1913, eventually displacing them from main line passenger duties. From that point the class was assigned to shorter commuter trains and deadhead rolling stock between Grand Central Terminal and Mott Haven coach yard. Some examples, including the prototype later renumbered #100, would serve in this capacity through the Penn Central merger in 1968, only being retired in the 1970s as long distance passenger traffic to Grand Central dried up. History Unit 6000 hauling a train with various railway officials, 1904 After a disastrous 1902 accident in the Park Avenue Tunnel the New York legislature passed a law banning steam locomotives within the city limits effective in 1908. Seeing an opportunity, the railroad decided this could mean a chance to completely rebuild its congested Midtown Manhattan stub end terminal and yard facilities. The electrification project would see not only the construction of the Grand Central Terminal itself, but miles of completely underground platforms and yard tracks which would not have been possible with exhaust producing steam locomotives. Having already found success with the world's first main line electrification project in Baltimore in 1895, ALCO and General Electric were tasked with designing a new locomotive for the project with Alco building the engine and GE supplying the electrical equipment. The initial prototype locomotive, delivered as Class L #6000, was in the 1-D-1 configuration with 4 gearless \\"bi-polar\\" type traction motors which used the axle shaft as the motor armature. Between October 1904 and July 1906 #6000 racked up in test on a track near both Alco and GE plants in Schenectady, New York. The advantages of the new locomotive were striking. It was only half the length of a standard steam locomotive with tender and weighed only two thirds as much, but could provide more power, especially when starting trains on steep grades. It was capable of rapid acceleration and deceleration, ideal for the Hudson and Harlem lines‚Äô numerous, closely spaced commuter rail stations. The locomotive required no turntable and could be reversed for service in the opposite direction in a matter of seconds. With the tests complete an order was placed for 34 additional locomotives to be delivered in the 3400 series and classed T-2 with the original being re-classed T-1. Unfortunately, two days into the new electric service in 1907 a train led by two T-2 class locomotives number 3407 and 3421 derailed on a curve on the Harlem Line killing 24 and injuring 140. The investigation identified design flaws involving the long rigid wheelbase and its performance at high speed. The solution was to convert the entire class to use 2 axle leading and trailing trucks to better guide the locomotive around curves. Units already delivered were modified to fit the extra wheels and units not delivered were modified in the factory. Again the class was changed from T to S. Finally in 1908 an additional batch of 12 locomotives, class S-3, were ordered to support the electrification being extended to North White Plains on the Harlem Line. The original S-Motor, former No. 6000, awaiting restoration south of Albany, NY in 2012. With weight split between powered and unpowered axles the S motors were never completely satisfactory at pulling long heavy trains at high speed. The 1907 accident only made matters worse with additional unpowered axles being added and new speed restrictions imposed. Finally in 1913 the new class of T-Motors arrived, displacing the S Motors from first line service. For the next 60 years the S-motors were assigned to short local commuter trains and empty equipment movements between Grand Central and the Coach Yards at Mott Haven. They were later re-numbered into the 1100 series and ultimately the 100 series with some examples surviving the Penn Central merger. The combination of the New Haven's new 60 unit strong electro-diesel FL-9 to handle short commuter trains and the drastic reduction in long distance passenger trains using the Mott Haven coach yards eventually ended these niche applications as well. Their final assignment was switching service in the underground yards of Grand Central Terminal. The last S motor, #115, was finally retired from Conrail commuter operations in 1981 after 75 years in service, being replaced by GE E-10 steeplecab units purchased second hand from the Niagara Junction Railroad. Three S-Motors were preserved including the prototype #100. Two are in museums, #113 at the St. Louis Museum of Transportation, and #115 at the Illinois Railway Museum; however, #100, owned by the Mohawk and Hudson chapter NRHS, is stored outside on an abandoned rail spur in Glenmont, New York awaiting funds for restoration.

National Security Agency is a United States class action lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) against the National Security Agency (NSA) and several high-ranking officials in the administration of 43rd U.S. president George W. Bush, charging an \\"illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance\\".  History  The case was filed on behalf of Carolyn Jewel and several other AT&T; customers on September 18, 2008, and is based on documentation provided by former AT&T; technician Mark Klein. The case was dismissed on January 21, 2010, by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Vaughn Walker, who concluded that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing because their claims amounted to a \\"general grievance\\" against the government. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the case on December 29, 2011. NSA whistleblower William Binney testified in July 2012 in support of the EFF that the NSA was \\"purposefully violating the Constitution\\". On July 8, 2013, Judge Jeffrey White of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined to dismiss the lawsuit under the state secrets privilege. Later in 2013 the court ordered the government to explain the effects of intelligence leaks about the NSA's surveillance activities, primarily by Edward Snowden, on the national security impact of the case. The NSA reasserted the state secrets privilege on December 20, 2013, and declassified portions of its assertions of the state secrets privilege the following day. On March 10, 2014, Judge White imposed a temporary restraining order, requiring the NSA and other parties to halt the destruction of evidence until a final resolution of the case. On June 5, 2014, the EFF filed a motion for an emergency hearing requesting that the court enforce this temporary restraining order after discovering that the government had continued the destruction of evidence. A motion filed by the government claimed that doing so would have severe consequences \\"including the possible suspension of the Section 702 program and potential loss of access to lawfully collected signals intelligence information on foreign intelligence targets\\".https://www.eff.org/files/2014/06/05/govtemergencymotion.pdf On February 10, 2015, Judge White dismissed a challenge by the plaintiffs of the constitutionality of the UPSTREAM data collection program. The court ruled that the challenge would require the \\"impermissible disclosure of state secret information\\", and also ruled that the plaintiffs did not have standing to pursue their claims. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the NSA's collection of Internet and phone content. Judge White also wrote that some of the EFF's factual allegations about the program were not correct, but did not identify any specific inaccuracies. On May 19, 2017, Judge White ordered the government to provide \\"all relevant evidence necessary to prove or deny that plaintiffs were subject to NSA surveillance via tapping into the Internet backbone\\".

Built in 1963, it is one of the oldest county jails in California. The Men's Central Jail is located at 441 Bauchet St., Los Angeles 90012. The Men's Central Jail houses men who are awaiting trial or who have been convicted of crimes. The Men's Central Jail is considered one of the largest jails in the world. In May 2013, along with the adjacent Twin Towers Correctional Facility, Men's Central Jail was ranked as one of the ten worst prisons in the United States, based on reporting in Mother Jones magazine. On July 7, 2020, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted 4‚Äì0 to pursue a plan to close the Men's Central Jail within 12 months. In voting to eventually close the 57-year-old facility, county supervisors said they wanted to focus on community-based programs to treat mental health challenges of those entering and exiting the jail system administered by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The vote came amid deliberate inmate reductions during outbreaks of COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement protests over police violence and the killing of George Floyd. Construction and population The construction of the Men's Central Jail was finished in 1963. The original building was designed to house 3,323 inmates. In 1976, an addition was added to the structure at the cost of $35 million, and by December 1990, inmate capacity was 5,276. Men's Central Jail has severe overcrowding, leading to problems such as inmates lacking shower facilities, very short recreation times out of their cells, wearing dirty clothes for up to a week, and inmates sleeping on floors for extended periods of time. In March 1997, the inmate population was about 13,000, and saw similarly high numbers by June 2015, where the inmate population was about 17,000 and increased to 1900 by August, where the legal limits on the jail population were only for 15,000 inmates.

He is the proponent of a novel concept in education called Multiple Natures, which is a psychological framework that helps in understanding people‚Äôs natures and personality traits that result in particular behavioral patterns, specifically related to learning and work. Rudolph is the co-founder and Educational Director of Jiva Institute in Faridabad. He conducts life skills workshops and educational lectures for students, parents and educators and training sessions for academic counsellors.Article in Mumbai Mirror Website Early life and education Rudolph did his schooling from Wayne Valley High School in Wayne, New Jersey and graduated with a B.A. degree in English from the University of Florida. He started his career as a teacher at the Center for American Language, New York, and also taught English as a Foreign Language at Kanda Gaigo Gakuin (Kanda Institute of Foreign Languages) in Japan. He received his master's degree in Education from Temple University, Tokyo. In 1993. Rudolph moved to India in 1994. Educational initiatives In 1995, Rudolph set up the first Internet connection in an Indian school ‚Äì Jiva Public School in Faridabad ‚Äì through tie-ups with ERNET (Education and Research Network, Government of India), Apple Computer, and Intel. Through this initiative, he introduced the Internet into hundreds of schools across the country. In 1997, Rudolph launched a series of modern computer books that familiarized Indian students and teachers with new uses of the computer. His books advocated computers as a tool for learning, communicating, drawing and creating music, as opposed to the existing curriculum that primarily dealt with programming languages like BASIC, operating systems like DOS, hardware, and the history of computers. In 2001, Rudolph authored textbook materials based on Howard Gardner‚Äôs framework of Multiple Intelligences. Known as ICOT (India‚Äôs Curriculum of Tomorrow), the curriculum incorporated High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), technology, and value-based activities. In 2009, Rudolph authored his first book, The 10 Laws of Learning, which was specifically written for Indian parents. The book proposes a number of educational principles, which, if followed, can lead to increased levels of learning. In 2011, he authored his second book, Solving the Ice Cream Dilemma. A book on careers, Solving the Ice Cream Dilemma is published by Times Group Books and seeks to help parents help their kids in solving their career confusion. Multiple Natures In June 2008, Rudolph introduced his theory of ‚ÄòMultiple Natures‚Äô, a psychological model that attempts to understand people‚Äôs natures and defining personality traits. The model seeks to explain why certain people are drawn more towards certain activities and careers. It also reasons that the dominance or weakness of a particular nature is dependent on the events and circumstances faced by a person during the course of his or her life. In all, Rudolph has identified nine such natures in each person - Protective, Educative, Administrative, Creative, Healing, Entertaining, Providing, Entrepreneurial, and Adventurous.

Plot This novel centers around the exploits of Clive Cussler's characters Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. These two and other members of NUMA respond to several mysterious incidents. One is the sudden disappearance of an underwater lab conducting experiments on a rare jellyfish (the Blue Medusa (Cyanea lamarckii?)), an attack on a bathysphere that almost kills passenger Zavala and an attempt to kidnap a Chinese scientist at a remote lab in the Florida Keys. The NUMA team seeks to discover who is behind these incidents. They discover a criminal organization based in China that is conducting unethical medical experiments on humans and intends to create a deadly virus that it will threaten to unleash in an attempt to blackmail the world into surrendering to its whims.

The shoulder of the shell is usually nodulose and the protoconch is usually multispiral. Markings often include the presence of tents except for black or white color variants, with the absence of spiral lines of minute tents and textile bars. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The radula has an elongated anterior section with serrations and a large exposed terminating cusp, a non-obvious waist, blade is either small or absent and has a short barb, and lacks a basal spur. ::Geographical distribution :::These species are found in the Indo- Pacific region. ::Feeding habits :::These species eat other gastropods including cones. * Subgenus Gradiconus da Motta, 1991 ::Shell characters (living and fossil species) :::The shell is turbinate in shape. The protoconch is paucispiral, cords are either absent or disappear in the early postnuclear whorls. The anal notch is deep. The shell may be ornamented with hemispherical nodules undulating along the shoulder angle in the early postnuclear whorls, and ridges may persist or die out on the body whorl. The color pattern consists of dots or dashes in spiral lines and/or longitudinal markings. The periostracum is tufted or has a fringe along the shoulder angle, and the operculum is small to minute. ::Radular tooth (not known for fossil species) :::The anterior section of the radular tooth is roughly equal to the length of the posterior section, and the blade is more than half the length of the anterior section. A basal spur is present, the barb is short, and there is an internal terminating cusp. The radular tooth is serrated. ::Geographical distribution :::The species in this genus occur in the West Atlantic and Eastern Pacific regions. ::Feeding habits :::These cone snails are vermivorous, meaning that the cones prey on polychaete worms.

In 2009 however, J.K. Tucker and M.J. Tenorio proposed a classification system for the over 600 recognized species that were in the family. Their classification proposed 3 distinct families and 82 genera for the living species of cone snails. This classification was based upon shell morphology, radular differences, anatomy, physiology, cladistics, with comparisons to molecular (DNA) studies. Published accounts of genera within the Conidae that include the genus Gradiconus include J.K. Tucker & M.J. Tenorio (2009), and Bouchet et al.

Testing in order to try to understand the molecular phylogeny of the Conidae was initially begun by Christopher Meyer and Alan Kohn,Interview of Professor Alan Kohn, Professor Emeritus, Zoology and is continuing, particularly with the advent of nuclear DNA testing in addition to mDNA testing. However, in 2011, some experts still prefer to use the traditional classification, where all species are placed in Conus within the single family Conidae: for example, according to the current November 2011 version of the World Register of Marine Species, all species within the family Conidae are in the genus Conus. The binomial names of species in the 82 cone snail genera listed in Tucker & Tenorio 2009 are recognized by the World Register of Marine Species as \\"alternative representations.\\" http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=14107 Classification: Traditionally, all cone shells have been included in the Linnaean genus Conus. Tucker & Tenorio (2009) have recently proposed an alternative shell- and radula-based classification that recognizes 4 families and 80 genera of cones. In WoRMS, we currently still recognize a single family Conidae (following Puillandre et al. 2011), but Tucker & Tenorio's 80 genera classification is presented as \\"alternative representation\\". [P. Bouchet, 14 Aug. 2011] Debate within the scientific community regarding this issue continues, and additional molecular phylogeny studies are being carried out in an attempt to clarify the issue.C.M.L.

In 2015, in the Journal of Molluscan Studies, Puillandre, Duda, Meyer, Olivera & Bouchet presented a new classification for the old genus Conus. Using 329 species, the authors carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses. The results suggested that the authors should place all cone snails in a single family, Conidae, containing four genera: Conus, Conasprella, Profundiconus and Californiconus. The authors group 85% of all known cone snail species under Conus, They recognize 57 subgenera within Conus, and 11 subgenera within the genus Conasprella. References  Further reading  * Kohn A. A.

Biography Cassou, a French-born American citizen, is using painting as a tool for self-discovery, and for exploring the spiritual dimensions of the creative process via the \\"Point Zero Painting\\" technique.The Soul of Creativity, Edited by Tona Pearce Myers, 1999,p.2-6, Her very early paintings are included in the Collection de l'art brut, Jean Dubuffet's collection permanently on display in Lausanne.\\"Collection de l'Art Brut, Jean Dubuffet's.\\" http://www.rawvision.com/outsiderart/whatisoa.html She has been teaching since her early twenties, first in Paris, then Canada, Ottawa and Montreal, then in the United States. Presently she teaches the Point Zero Method under the name Michele Cassou Painting Workshops. She conducts workshops in the San Francisco Area, at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur California, at the New York Open Center and at the Mabel Dodge Luhan House in Taos New Mexico, in various Zen centers and other locations throughout the United States and Europe. Early life and education Michele Cassou was born in 1942 in Marseilles, the daughter of a Jewish mother and a father who was a Catholic French officer. The family fled to Morocco during the war, where Michele spent the first three years of her life, not meeting her father until the end of the war. Then with her mother she moved to the town of Hy√®res on the Mediterranean. She started to draw and paint when she was five years old. At the age of 14 her growing family, now including seven children, moved to Paris where Michele attended Helen Boucher High School. Shortly before she turned 17 her family moved to Algeria to join her father who was serving as an officer in the Algerian war. Michele finished high school in Algeria. At the end of Michele ºs last year of high school the family moved back to Paris. She subsequently enrolled in traditional Parisian art classes and joined L‚ÄôAcademie du Jeudi, a free expression studio for children, created and run by Arno Stern. She remained at the studio for almost four years, where she also came into contact with Krisnamurti through his books, which have influenced her life and teaching. She began teaching painting in her early twenties. Michele was married in the early 1960s and in 1965, gave birth to her only son, Phillipe. During the 1968 student uprisings in Paris Michele was asked to paint a huge mural in one of the amphitheaters of La Sorbonne. Within a few years the family moved to Canada. After seven years of marriage, divorced, Michele returned to the South of France for a year. In a small village Nans les pins, she studied Yoga and meditation. She then moved back to Canada, and soon after the United States where she settled in California. In 1978, she founded The Painting Experience Studio in San Francisco. This studio offered classes and workshops year round for 11 years; in 1996 The Painting Experience Studio closed and its name moved to different teachings. She continues to paint and teach workshops, write and train teachers in the Point Zero Method throughout the United States and Europe. Transformative work Cassou and her work have received praise by other artists and authors.Point Zero, Creativity Without Limits, Michele Cassou, Julia Cameron, 2008, Front Cover.

It is located on the left side of Ialno range, in the gorges of the rivers Alikhevi and Tevali, and is at an altitude of 770 meters. It is 55 kilometres from Gardabani and 12 kilometres from Vaziani (the nearest railway station). According to 2014 census, the village is populated by 7397 residents. The region of Martkopi played a big role during the third millennium BC. It is distinguished by many rich burial kurgans, representing the early stage of the Early Kurgan culture of Central Transcaucasia. History Martkopi territory was inhabited from 1st to the 2nd century. Till the 6th century its name was Akriani. It is considered that name ‚ÄúMartkopi‚Äù comes from one of the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers - Anton Martqopeli (martomkopeli in Georgian means someone who is living alone). A cathedral was established at the older monastery in the 13th century, which since the 15th century became a centre of Sadrosho (administrative unit in feudal Georgia mainly used for army mobilizing). In 1625 in Martkopi a military confrontation took place between Georgia and Iran. In addition Martkopi served as a cultural centre too. The names of the famous Georgian poets and writers Nikolos Cherkesishvili (17th-18th century), Ioan Khobulashvili (18th century), Stefane Djorjadze (18th century) and others are associated with the village. Precious Parthian coins (100 BC-200 AD) were found in the territory of the village. In Martkopi ruins of cupola church is still preserved. It was built in 1810 by bishop of Rustavi Stefane II. Some other family castles from the 18th century can also be found here. Near the village is Ghvtaeba monastery complex dating back to 5th‚Äî6th centuries. Bronze age Close to village in the Ulevari valley archaeologists discovered bronze-age graves. Martkopi kurgans Several rich burial kurgans have been discovered in the area. They represent the early stage of the Early Kurgan culture of Central Transcaucasia. The Martkopi Culture may be dated before 2550 BC.Mikheil Abramishvili, In search of the origins of metallurgy ‚Äì An overview of South Caucasian evidence. Bonn 2010 This Early Kurgan period, known as Martkopi-Bedeni, has been interpreted as a transitional phase and the first stage of the Middle Bronze Age. To the earliest group belong the kurgans or barrows of the Martkopi/Ulevari and Samgori valleys (east of Tbilisi), and the earliest among the Trialeti culture.The Beginnings of Metallurgy The somewhat later kurgans are of Bedeni type. They are represented by the kurgans of the Bedeni plateau (near Trialeti), and also those of the Alazani valley (in Kakheti, eastern part of East Georgia). This stage of the Early Bronze Age seems to represent the final stage of the Kura-Araxes culture. According to recent dating, the transition to the Early Kurgan period was around the mid of the 3rd millennium -- somewhat between the 27th to 24th century BC.Thomas St√∂llner, Irina Gambaschidze (2014) THE GOLD MINE OF SAKDRISI AND EARLIEST MINING AND METALLURGY IN THE TRANSCAUCASUS AND THE KURA-VALLEY SYSTEMKavtaradze 2004; Kohl 2007: 108 Metalwork There appears to be the new abundance of metals in this period.

It is affiliated with Football Brisbane, and as such competes in Football Brisbane sanctioned competitions. The home ground of the club is Barry White Field, Greenbank. It currently has approximately 280 players ranging from juniors to seniors and are the current (2011) champions in Men's Metro Three, Metro Six and Women's Division 7 competitions. History Formation Formed in 1976, Greenbank Football Club is one of the older football clubs in the Logan West area. Originally named Greenbank Soccer Club, the club officially changed its name to Greenbank Football Club in 2008. For years, the team's unofficial nickname were The Grasshoppers, however, the name has not been used since. Greenbank FC is known for its mixture of bottle green and gold colours. There have been numerous incarnations of the club logo, however, currently the logo has a black and white football centred with the writing \\"Greenbank\\" across the top and \\"Football Club Inc\\" surrounding the football. 2011 season The 2011 season saw what would arguably be the most successful season in Greenbank FC's history. Fielding six senior teams and more than one dozen junior teams Greenbank made history by winning three of its six senior grand finals. September 17, 2011 will go into Greenbank FC's history books as the day that the club celebrated the treble. On September 17, 2011, Greenbank's Division 7 women's team faced Logan City Kings in their grand final at 12:30PM. In the searing heat, Greenbank FC dominated from start to finish piling on 3 goals by half time. Logan City failed to trouble Greenbank's defence and in the very few times Greenbank's goalkeeper was called upon, she denied Logan City pulling off a string of solid saves. Greenbank Div 7 eventually beat Logan City 5‚Äì0 to celebrate the team's first grand final win on the day. This was the perfect way to end a successful season that saw the team finish top and claim the Championship/Premiership double. At 3PM, with the heat still in play, Greenbank's men's Metro Six came out to face their arch rivals Logan City Kings. Throughout the season Logan Kings and Greenbank traded places between first and second, with Greenbank eventually finishing second. Indeed, in all three games during the season Greenbank had failed to defeat Logan City. After coming through tough semi finals Greenbank and Logan City faced off. In a game that could be described as scrappy, Greenbank came out victorious via a 35th-minute goal by Shane Devlin. At 6PM that same night at the same venue in Capalaba, the men's Metro Three came out to face Bethania Rams. Throughout the season Greebank's Mentro Three's were hailed as the team to beat, scoring 99 goals and winning 16 out of 20 games. Logan City had finished second, scoring 102 goals and winning 13 from 20 games. It was, however, Bethania that was to be Greenbank's opponents in the final. Greenbank took a 5th-minute lead through their left winger Trevor Walsh. However, within 15 minutes Bethania restored parity. Ten minutes later Bethania shocked the large traveling Greenbank contingent as they scored a second. Greenbank was able to level, however, in the 72nd minute Bethania restored their lead. For the next ten minutes, Greenbank did everything they could to equalise. With five minutes to go, Andy McIntyre leveled the game and within two minutes, Justin lake scored the winner for Greenbank, capping off a fantastic season for the team and for the club.

It was the third Geopark to be designated in Ireland, and is recognised at both European and global levels. History The geopark began as a mid-2000s project of Clare County Council and the local community, the \\"Environmental Protection of the Burren through Visitor Management Initiative\\", which was funded and supported by the council, F√°ilte Ireland, Shannon Development, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Burrenbeo Trust. The initiative evolved into BurrenConnect in 2006, with a dedicated project manager.Interview with the Geopark Manager on Burren Connect and its predecessor and successor Strong community participation and engagement, both civic and business, continued throughout. The geopark was formally established in 2011, under the management of the County Council, with special support and some funding from the Geological Survey of Ireland and Failte Ireland. Status and recognition The geopark secured membership of both the European Geoparks Network and the UNESCO-assisted Global Network of National Geoparks in 2011. Global status must be renewed every four years and was successfully renewed in 2015. The geopark won the National Geographic World Legacy Award for Destination Leadership in 2016.Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark - World Legacy Award Organisation The geopark is hosted and ultimately managed by Clare County Council, and further supported by the Geological Survey of Ireland, with a range of other partners supporting the work in general, or in specific aspects, such as the Geopark LIFE program. Governance and oversight is provided by a Steering and Advisory Committee. Strategic and day-to-day operations are led by a manager, Carol Gleeson, previously the project manager of BurrenConnect, and there is a lead geologist, Dr Eamon N. Doyle, successor to Drs Sarah Gatley and later Ron√°n Hennessy. Other functions include communications, tourism support, and outreach. Much of the work of the geopark is done with partners. The operations of the geopark are dispersed, but it has office space within the Clare County Council local offices in Ennistymon. Features The Burren comprises dramatic glaciated karst landscapes on Ireland‚Äôs Atlantic coast which have been fashioned in a variety of limestones, sandstones and siltstones originating during the Carboniferous period. The nearby Cliffs of Moher are vertical sandstone and shale sea-cliffs, the highest in Europe, which rise to a height of over 200m in places and which have long drawn sightseers to the area. Important local sights include the Aillwee Cave system and Doolin Cave with one of the world's largest stalactites. Population centres include Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Kilfenora, Doolin, Lahinch, Ennistymon, Fanore and Kilshanny. Major activity centres include the Burren Outdoor Education Centre, the Burren Centre and the Boghill Centre. The Burren Outdoor Education Centre is a particularly active partner of the geopark. Major accommodation providers are also engaged, with a network of local hospitality providers, hotels, bed-and-breakfast establishments and at least one retreat centre. The Geosites Over the life of the geopark to date, twenty focal \\"geosites\\" have been designated, with signage. These sites are chosen for accessibility and geological interest, along with possible architectural and / or heritage interest. They are specially monitored for littering, graffiti and damage.The Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark (Ennistymon): Integrated Management at Heritage Sites Events Regular cycles of lectures are run, as well as the Burren Rocks festival.

The Catholic Church opposes abortion and has campaigned against abortion in the United States, both saying that it is immoral and making statements and taking actions in opposition to its classification as legal. Many Catholics in the United States disagree with the official position promulgated by the Church; the views of these people range from allowing exceptions in a generally anti-abortion position, to complete acceptance of abortion. There is a distinction between practicing Catholics and non- practicing Catholics on the issue; practicing Catholics, along with Latino Catholics, are far more likely to be anti-abortion, while non-practicing Catholics are more likely to be pro-abortion rights. In recent decades, the church's opposition to abortion, and specifically the actions it has taken against pro-abortion rights Catholics, has often been the subject of controversy. History 19th century In the latter half of the 19th century, the Catholic Church in the United States took the lead in denouncing what it termed \\"criminal abortion\\". The Michigan State Medical Society journal reported in 1870 that, while most churches were \\"neglecting\\" the subject of abortion, Catholic priests were teaching that \\"destruction of the embryo at any period from the first instant of conception is a crime equal in guilt to that of murder,\\" and \\"that to admit its practice is to open the way for the most unbridled licentiousness, and to take away the responsibility of maternity is to destroy one of the strongest bulwarks of female virtue.\\"of the Special Committee on Criminal Abortion p. 378. In 1881 the same journal reported that Catholic anti-abortion efforts had been much more successful than Protestant ones.of the Washington Obstetrical and Gynecological Society Role in the abortion debate Following the 1968 publication of Humanae Vitae, an encyclical by Pope Paul VI that expressly forbade abortion and most methods of birth control and that sowed controversy within the church over its restatement of the prohibition on birth control, Catholic bishops in the United States started to stress anti-abortion views as a central facet of Catholic identity and preached against proposed liberalization of state-level abortion laws. Before the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which resulted in the legalization of abortion in the United States, the United States right-to-life movement consisted of lawyers, politicians, and doctors, almost all of whom were Catholic. The only coordinated opposition to abortion during the early 1970s came from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Family Life Bureau, also a Catholic organization. According to Charles Curran, prior to Roe v. Wade abortion was not a high priority for Catholic bishops in the United States. According to Curran, the level of involvement of the Catholic hierarchy changed dramatically after Roe v. Wade. A short time after the decision, the Catholic-sponsored National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) was created to mobilize a wide-scale anti-abortion movement. The NRLC also organized non-Catholics, and eventually become the largest anti-abortion organization in the United States. Curran asserts that, since Roe v. Wade, the Catholic hierarchy in the United States has devoted more time, energy and money to the issue of abortion than any other single issue. The American media has followed and reported on the substantial role of the Catholic Church in the abortion debate. Connie Paige has been quoted as having said that: > [t]he Roman Catholic Church created the right-to-life movement. Without the > church, the movement would not exist as such today.\\" At the same time, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, in Forming consciences for Faithful Citizenship, quoted the words of Pope John Paul II: \\"The fact that only the negative commandments oblige always and under all circumstances does not mean that in the moral life prohibitions are more important than the obligation to do good indicated by the positive commandment.\\"Veritatis Splendor, no. 52. Dissenting Catholics An independent organization called Catholics for Choice was founded in 1973 to support the availability of abortion, stating that this position is compatible with Catholic teachings, particularly the primacy of conscience and the importance of the laity in shaping church law. This organization was founded \\"to serve as a voice for Catholics\\" who believe that contraception and abortion are moral. Catholics for Choice believe: In October 1984, Catholics for Choice (then Catholics for a Free Choice) placed an advertisement, called \\"A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion\\" and signed by over one hundred prominent Catholics, including nuns, in the New York Times. The advertisement stated that \\"direct abortion...can sometimes be a moral choice\\" and that \\"responsible moral decisions can only be made in an atmosphere of freedom from fear of coercion.\\" The Vatican initiated disciplinary measures against some of the nuns who signed the statement, sparking controversy among American Catholics, and intra-Catholic conflict on the abortion issue remained news for at least two years in the United States. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has stated that \\"[CFC] is not a Catholic organization, does not speak for the Catholic Church, and in fact promotes positions contrary to the teaching of the Church as articulated by the Holy See and the USCCB.\\"NCCB/USCC President Issues Statement on Catholics for a Free Choice Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz excommunicated all members of this organization in his jurisdiction in 1996.Vatican affirms excommunication of Call to Action members in Lincoln Margaret McBride In November 2009, when Sister Margaret McBride, as a member of the ethics board of a Catholic hospital, allowed doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of a mother of four suffering from pulmonary hypertension, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted excommunicated her on the grounds that, while efforts should be made to save a pregnant woman's life, abortion cannot be used as a means to that end. Politics Pro-abortion rights Catholic politicians Since the Catholic Church views abortion as gravely wrong, it considers it a duty to reduce its acceptance by the public and in civil legislation. While it considers that Catholics should not favour direct abortion in any field, it recognizes that Catholics may accept compromises that, while permitting direct abortions, lessen their incidence by, for instance, restricting some forms or enacting remedies against the conditions that give rise to them. Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton (editors), Encyclopedia of Catholicism (Facts on File 2007 ), p. 5 In 1990, John Cardinal O'Connor of New York suggested that, by supporting abortion rights, Catholic politicians who were pro-abortion rights risked excommunication. The response of Catholic pro-abortion rights politicians to O'Connor's comment was generally defiant. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi asserted that, \\"There is no desire to fight with the cardinals or archbishops. But it has to be clear that we are elected officials and we uphold the law and we support public positions separate and apart from our Catholic faith.\\" There has been controversy in the United States over whether Catholic politicians who promote legalization of abortion should be denied communion. Most instances of such controversy have involved a bishop threatening to deny a politician communion, although other cases have involved a bishop telling a politician not to seek communion or considering excommunicating the politician. Those bishops who support denying communion, including Raymond Leo Burke, base their position on Canon 915.NCRegister.com \\"America's 'Most Complete' Catholic Newsweekly\\" Because few American bishops are in favor of withholding communion from politicians and the majority are opposed, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided in 2004 that such matters should left to the discretion of each bishop on a case-by-case basis.Sandro Magister, \\"Obama's Pick for Vice President Is Catholic. But the Bishops Deny Him Communion\\" These statements of intent from church authorities have sometimes led American Catholic voters to vote for candidates who wish to ban abortion, rather than pro-abortion rights candidates who support other Catholic Church positions, such as war, health care, immigration, or lowering the abortion rate. Penalties of this kind from bishops have targeted Democrats, although a number of prominent Republican politicians are also pro- abortion rights. Politicians who have been targeted in such controversies include Lucy Killea, Mario Cuomo, John Kerry, Rudy Giuliani, and Joe Biden. Killea's case was the first recorded; Kerry's led to comparisons between his presidential campaign and that of John F. Kennedy in 1960. While Kennedy had to demonstrate his independence from the Roman Catholic Church due to public fear that a Catholic president would make decisions based on Vatican commands, it seemed that Kerry, in contrast, had to show obedience to Catholic authorities in order to win votes. Proposals to deny communion to pro-abortion rights politicians are unique to the United States. Suggested reasons for this uniqueness are a politicization of pastoral practice and abortion's constitutional status as a right.\\"The Word from Rome\\", John L. Allen, Jr. in National Catholic Reporter, 28 May 200 Attitudes of Catholic laity Many or most U.S. Catholics disagree with official Church teaching on abortion in some or all particulars. The distribution of views among U.S. Catholics regarding abortion is substantially the same as the distribution of views among non- Catholics. Moral acceptability Analysis of the 2006-2008 Gallup Values and Beliefs surveys indicates that 40% of Catholics consider abortion \\"morally acceptable\\", a result that is roughly equivalent to the 41% of non-Catholics holding the same view. According to 1995 survey by Lake Research and Tarrance Group, 64% of U.S. Catholics say they disapprove of the statement that \\"abortion is morally wrong in every case\\". According to 2016 survey by Pew Research Center, 51% of U.S. Catholics say that \\"having an abortion is morally wrong\\". According to Marist College Institute for Public Opinion's survey released in 2008, 36% of practising Catholics, defined as those who attend church at least twice a month, consider themselves \\"pro-choice\\"; while 65% of non-practicing Catholics considers themselves \\"pro-choice\\", 76% of them says that \\"abortion should be significantly restricted\\". According to the National Catholic Reporter, some 58% of American Catholic women feel that they do not have to follow the abortion teaching of their bishop. Legality Between 16% and 22% of American Catholic voters share the view that abortion should never be permitted by law. According to 2009 survey by Pew Research Center, 47% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be legal in \\"all or most cases\\", while 42% of American Catholics believe that abortion should be illegal in \\"all or most cases\\". When posed a binary question of whether abortion was acceptable or unacceptable, rather than a question of whether it should be allowed or not allowed in all or most cases, according to polls conducted in 2006-2008 by Gallup, 40% of American Catholics said it was acceptable, approximately the same percentage as non-Catholics; The same poll reported American Catholics as more permissive than American non-Catholics on sex between an unmarried man and woman, divorce, medical research using stem cells obtained from human embryos, having a baby outside of marriage, gambling and homosexual relations. 58% of American Catholics said it was morally wrong. It is said that \\"Latino Catholics\\" in the United States are also more likely to oppose abortion than \\"White Catholics\\". Some reasons for dissenting from the church's position on the legality of abortion, other than finding abortion morally acceptable, include \\"I am personally opposed to abortion, but I think the Church is concentrating its energies too much on abortion rather than on social action\\"[books.google.com/books/about/Catholics_and_American_Politics.html?id=f3oEnwEACAAJ &btnG;= Mary T. Hanna, Catholics and American Politics] (Harvard University Press 1979 ), p. 154 or \\"I do not wish to impose my views on others.\\"John Finnis, Religion and Public Reasons (Oxford University Press 2011 ), vol. 5, p. 122Susan Elizabeth Davis, Women under Attack (South End Press 1999 ), p. 61Patrick W. Carey, Catholics in America (Greenwood 2004 ), p. 135Christopher Robert Kaczor, The Ethics of Abortion (Taylor & Francis 2010 ), p. 202 Prevalence of abortion A 1994-1995 survey conducted by Guttmacher Institute of abortion patients found that \\"Catholic women have an abortion rate 29% higher than Protestant women.\\" Attitudes of committed Catholics Attitudes of U.S. Catholics regarding abortion were found to differ significantly when the polls distinguished between practicing and/or churchgoing Catholics and non-practicing Catholics. Those who attend church weekly are more likely to oppose abortion. According to Marist College Institute for Public Opinion's survey released in 2008, 36% of practising Catholics, defined as those who attend church at least twice a month, consider themselves \\"pro-choice\\"; while 65% of non-practicing Catholics considers themselves \\"pro-choice\\", 76% of them says that \\"abortion should be significantly restricted\\". According to polls conducted in 2006-2008 by Gallup, 24% of practicing Catholics, defined in this poll as those who attend church \\"weekly or almost every week\\", believe abortion is morally acceptable. Compatibility of dissent with Catholic belief While 58% of American Catholics are likely to agree that abortion is morally wrong, and 46% of white Catholics and 65% of Latino Catholics are likely to agree that abortion is a sin, according to 2011 report by Public Religion Research Institute, 68% of American Catholics are likely to agree that one \\"can still be a good Catholic even if you disagree with official church teaching on abortion,\\" approximately as many as members of other religious groups. On this long-standing phenomenon of a number of Catholics disagreeing with the Church's official position on abortion, Pope John Paul II reiterated in 1987 that it \\"is a grave error\\" to \\"claim that dissent from the Magisterium is totally compatible with being a good Catholic and poses no obstacle to the reception of the sacraments.\\" In what the Los Angeles Times called a key admonition, he added: \\"It has never been easy to accept the Gospel teaching in its entirety, and it never will be.\\" Voting Abortion is not the main issue most American Catholics consider when choosing how to vote. A survey in 2008 showed that less than one third (29%) of Catholic voters in the U.S. stated that they choose their candidate based solely on the candidate's position on abortion; most of these vote for anti-abortion candidates. 44% believe a \\"good Catholic\\" cannot vote for a pro-abortion rights politician, while 53% believe one can. Dissenting individuals and groups Philosopher Daniel Dombrowski wrote, with Richard Deltete, A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion, which analyzed Church theological history to argue that Catholic values supported a pro-abortion rights position.

The memorial was the first of dozens by Lutyens to be built in permanent form and it influenced his later designs, including The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London. It is a tapering, multi-tiered pylon which culminates in a series of diminishing layers before terminating in a sarcophagus (or cenotaph, \\"empty tomb\\") which features a recumbent figure of a soldier. In front is an altar- like Stone of Remembrance. The cenotaph contains multiple sculptural details including a prominent cross, the town's coat of arms, and two lions. The names of the dead are inscribed on three sides. Although similar in outline, Lutyens' later cenotaphs were much more austere and featured almost no sculpture. The design uses abstract, ecumenical features and lifts the recumbent soldier high above eye level, anonymising him. The memorial was unveiled at a public ceremony on 6 November 1920. Shortly afterwards, concerns emerged that the list of names on the cenotaph was incomplete. After a newspaper campaign, more than 200 further names were identified and these were eventually added to the cenotaph. The names of most Jewish casualties were omitted, the Jewish community being unhappy that the memorial featured a Christian cross. By the beginning of the 21st century, the engravings on the memorial had deteriorated noticeably. Rather than re-cut them and damage the stonework, they were supplemented by a series of glass panels which bear all the names from the cenotaph, as well as names from the Second World War and later conflicts. The panels were unveiled in 2011. The memorial is a Grade I listed building, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens established his reputation before the war by designing country houses for wealthy clients and through his work on the new imperial headquarters at New Delhi. The war affected him deeply and, following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. His biographer Jane Brown records that, in the 1920s, more than half of his commissions were \\"for memorials and tombs, (his) clients more the dead than the living\\". He designed Southampton Cenotaph at around the same as his most famous memorial, The Cenotaph on Whitehall in London. The cenotaph, along with Lutyens' work for the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire.Brown, pp. 174‚Äì175.Skelton, p. 37.Stamp. p. 65.Brown, pp. 212‚Äì213 Being a major port town, Southampton was heavily involved in the British war effort from the outset. It became the main embarkation point for troops crossing the Channel to France and the main receiving point for wounded personnel being evacuated back to Britain; much of Southampton Common became an assembly point. Over the course of the war, more than eight million soldiers passed through Southampton on their way to the front.Eddleston, chapter 3, location 163. As elsewhere, many men from the town quickly volunteered for military service after Britain declared war on Germany, a preponderance of them joining the Hampshire Regiment.Eddleston, chapter 3, location 180. Many others from Southampton served on merchant vessels, several of which were sunk during the course of the war, such as the , an armed merchant cruiser sunk in February 1916, and the , an ocean liner converted to a hospital ship, which was sunk in March 1917. The names of the casualties were routinely printed in the local press.Eddleston, chapter 5, location 518.Eddleston, chapter 6, location 755. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Southampton docks were still busy with military movements, starting with repatriation of prisoners of war and casualties, followed by other soldiers and materiel returning from the front lines.Eddleston, chapter 8, location 1029. Commissioning Sculpted lion on the southern face of the Southampton Cenotaph Shortly after the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, a public meeting was held in the city of Southampton which voted to construct a memorial to honour the city's war dead. A committee, headed by the Lord Mayor of Southampton, Sidney Kimber, was elected and discussions began as to what form such a memorial should take. The committee decided that their preferred option would be to construct a single, high-quality memorial in a good location within Southampton and began to consider architects and locations, with a proposed budget of ¬£10,000. Alfred Gutteridge, an architect on one of the sub-committees, knew and recommended Lutyens, who travelled to Southampton to meet Kimber, Gutteridge, and other members of the committee in January 1919.Skelton, p. 17. Lutyens argued successfully against the committee's initial proposed location on Asylum Green in favour of Watts Park. His initial design featured a Stone of Remembrance (an altar-like monolith used in most IWGC cemeteries and several of Lutyens' memorials in Britain) with a substantial archway on either side, each archway supporting a recumbent figure of a soldier on a sarcophagus. This was rejected due to the likely cost and instead Lutyens suggested a single empty sarcophagus or cenotaph, supported by a plinth, on top of a pillar (pylon) with pine cones mounted on urns standing on each side. This was agreed to at a public meeting in September 1919 and detailed work on the project began. The London firm of Holloway Brothers were selected as the contractor for the memorial; the project was completed on time in 1920 at a total cost of ¬£9,845.Skelton, pp. 37‚Äì38. Design and symbolism Southampton Cenotaph, viewed from Above Bar St The memorial stands on the east side of Watts Park, alongside Above Bar Street. It consists of a cenotaph‚Äîa pylon surmounted by a sarcophagus bearing a recumbent effigy of a fallen soldier‚Äîraised on five stone steps, in front of which is a Stone of Remembrance raised on two further steps. The cenotaph is a tapering, five-tiered pillar, connected by a low wall to two flanking columns topped by sculpted pine cones, which symbolise eternal life (being the fruit of an evergreen tree, the tree of life). The thin sheets of white Portland stone on the outside of the monument hide an inner brick core.Pevsner, p. 652.Olderr, p. 158. The pillar itself culminates in a series of diminishing tiers between the main body and the sarcophagus. It contains multiple sculptural details‚Äîa cross bearing a sword is engraved on the front (east) face of the largest (second) tier, on the tier above on the front and rear is carved Southampton's coat of arms, and on the fourth tier a lion stands on each side. Finally, on the fifth tier, below the sarcophagus, are wreaths which each contain emblems, representing the British Army, the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, and the Merchant Navy. The pillar is slightly curved (entasis) in imitation of the pillars at the Parthenon in Athens, and a similar effect was later repeated by Lutyens at the Whitehall Cenotaph. Besides the names of the dead, the only inscription on the cenotaph reads OUR GLORIOUS DEAD; The Stone of Remembrance is inscribed THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE, a phrase from the Book of Ecclesiasticus chosen by Rudyard Kipling.Geurst, pp. 51‚Äì52. The names of the dead are cut into recessed panels on the north, south, and west faces.Boorman (2005), pp. 18‚Äì19. Lutyens' design predominantly draws on a cleaner, more streamlined version of the classical symbolism used in earlier monuments. He reacted to the criticism of this sometimes cluttered approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms, but still retaining the ideal of a peaceful, \\"beautiful death\\". He used shapes derived from classical architecture and with an ecumenical appeal. Southampton's cenotaph features a slender cross, a late addition at the insistence of the committee, though Lutyens was reluctant to feature overtly religious symbolism on his memorials and he resisted pressure to incorporate a cross into several of his later cenotaphs, including Whitehall. Whereas memorials from previous wars, particularly the Second Boer War, often used allegorical figures, Southampton Cenotaph makes use of an abstract, beautiful design intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice and death. The recumbent figure of a soldier is placed high atop the structure, anonymising him and allowing the onlooker to believe that he could be somebody they personally mourned.King, pp. 132‚Äì139.Amery et al., p. 148.Winter, pp. 102‚Äì104. By placing the figure at the top of the pylon, Lutyens also draws attention to the detail at the top of the pylon, connecting the beauty of the design to the memory of the fallen soldier.Carden-Coyne, pp. 155‚Äì156. Poppy wreaths laid around the Stone of Remembrance Southampton's is significant as the first of Lutyens' First World War memorials to be completed in permanent form. It became the first of multiple cenotaphs by Lutyens across England and the British Empire. The heavy use of sculpture contrasts sharply with Lutyens' later cenotaphs (for example Whitehall or Manchester Cenotaph), which‚Äîalthough of a similar shape and size‚Äîwere far more austere and relied on subtler forms of expression. Additionally, the Whitehall cenotaph, and several of Lutyens' later cenotaphs, terminate in an empty coffin rather than a recumbent figure.Skelton, p. 38.Borg, p. 96. Lutyens reused several elements of his previous work at Southampton. He first designed the pine cones and piers (which flank the cenotaph) for a war shrine in Hyde Park in London. The war shrine was never built, but Lutyens re-used the flanking piers (without the pine cones) for the entrance to √âtaples Military Cemetery in France, which he designed for the IWGC.Geurst, p. 52.Stamp, pp. 39‚Äì42.Guerst, pp. 285‚Äì286.Corke, p. 45. Lutyens re-used several parts of the Southampton design, including the recumbent figure, in his proposal for the Royal Artillery Memorial in London, though that proposal was rejected by the client, who favoured a memorial with greater realism.Skelton, p. 150. The design that was eventually built, by sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger, features a dead soldier directly at eye level, as though just fallen. The soldier is covered by his greatcoat, thus still anonymised, but the stark imagery contrasts sharply with Lutyens' abstract, \\"beautiful\\" portrayal of death with the soldier raised high above the ground.Carden-Coyne, p. 156. File:Southampton Cenotaph, 4 January 2019 06.jpg File:Southampton Cenotaph, 4 January 2019 09.jpg File:Southampton Cenotaph, 4 January 2019 07.jpg History Flags lowered in salute at the Remembrance Day parade, 2011 The Cenotaph was unveiled by Major-General John Seely, the Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire, and dedicated by the Right Reverend Edward Talbot, Bishop of Winchester, at a public ceremony on 6 November 1920. Seely first removed a canvas covering the whole structure and then a Union Flag which covered the effigy of the soldier, after which the Last Post was played and the crowd observed a two-minute silence. The crowd recited the Lord's Prayer then sang the national anthem, God Save the King, after which Kimber handed the memorial over to the town council. Kimber was very pleased with both the project and Lutyens, and he hoped to build a second war memorial in Southampton using the architect‚ÄîLutyens even offered to design a War Cross free of charge‚Äîthough the project never came to fruition. The committee was left with a surplus of just over ¬£100 once it wound up, which it donated towards the Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Winchester War Memorial at Winchester Cathedral.Boorman (1995), pp. 220‚Äì221. Issues arose shortly after the unveiling concerning the names inscribed on the memorial. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, and a number of women, who had died during the war and these had been inscribed on the Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument multiple relatives approached the committee to request that additional names be added, only to be told that this was not possible. The Hampshire branch of the Comrades of the Great War took up the case and wrote to the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, appealing for families to come forward with more names of unlisted casualties. Kimber eventually agreed and 203 additional names were inscribed in November 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. The final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, featured a prominent Christian cross. This upset the Jewish community, and ultimately Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial; only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.Kushner (in Taylor, pp. 186‚Äì187). Glass panels inscribed with the names of the dead By the start of the 21st century it became evident that the soft stone of the Cenotaph was deteriorating badly as a result of water damage and frost. Recutting the names on the monument was discounted as a solution due to the long-term damage this repeated work would cause to the Cenotaph's structure. The council, supported by the Royal British Legion, decided to expand the war memorial instead. A memorial wall, designed by Martin Donlin, consisting of eight large glass panels, by mounted in blocks of Portland stone, was installed, with four panels on each side of the Cenotaph, at a cost of ¬£130,000, which was met by the city council and through public donations. The panels were engraved with the names of the World War I casualties and, in addition, those from Southampton who had died in later conflicts. The opportunity was taken to add names missing from the original monument so the Memorial Wall included a total of 2,368 names from the First World War as well as 927 from the Second World War and four from later conflicts‚Äîtwo from the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960), and one each from the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) and the Mau Mau Uprising (1952‚Äì1960). This addition to the Cenotaph was unveiled on 11 November 2011. Two additional stones were later added to the west of the Stone of Remembrance; one commemorates Southampton civilians who were killed in the Second World War and the other is dedicated to all service personnel from Southampton who died in the line of duty. Another stone was laid by the Cenotaph in 2018, dedicated to Southampton-born Major-General Daniel Marcus William Beak, VC, DSO, MC, who fought in and survived the First World War, and was awarded the Victoria Cross. A small metal plaque mounted on a concrete plinth was installed by Southampton City Council on 28 October 2006 to commemorate members of the International Brigades, communist paramilitaries who fought for the Spanish republican government against the rebelling nationalists (who were supported by Nazi Germany) in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939). It stands in a flower bed to the north-east of the cenotaph and lists the names of four casualties, along with a dedication. Southampton Cenotaph was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1981. Listing provides legal protection from demolition or modification; Grade II* is applied to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applied to about 5.5% of listings. It was upgraded to Grade I (the highest grade, reserved for buildings of \\"exceptional interest\\" and applied to only 2.5% of listings) in November 2015, when Historic England formed a national collection of Lutyens' 44 war memorials.

There are two kinds of Georgian livestock guardian dogs: the short haired \\"Lion\\" type, typically pure white or white with dark patches on its coat and the long hair \\"Bear\\" type are typically dark brown to black head and lighter brown covering the rest of the coat. In Georgia they are known as, Qartuli Nagazi. The short hair \\"Lion\\" type is considered to the oldest or Aboriginal variant of the breed, with the pure white being the rarest coat color. The \\"Lion\\" variant was predominantly found in the north-east regions of Georgia: Kazbegi, Khevsureti, and Tusheti, but is also found in the adjacent mountainous border areas of Russia and Azerbaijan. Description Because of their morphology and lineage, Georgian shepherds fall into the Molosser category. Male Georgian mountain dogs should be at least in height at the withers; females should be at least in height. Physically, these dogs are strongly-boned, muscular, and athletic, with a large head and powerful legs. Georgian mountain dogs tend to be assertive, brave, and alert. Shepherds traditionally used Georgian mountain dogs for defending sheep from predators. History The Cynological Federation of Georgia has had a strict battle with the Russian federation of Cynologs about Caucasian Shepherd dog. In 2012, the International Cynological Federation was to have decided which national breed would be the Caucasian Shepherd Dog as a result of this heated discussion. After the removal of most of the Qartuli Nagazi from Georgia, Georgian enthusiasts with support from the Ministry of Environment began expeditions to the regions of Georgia to describe and take photos of the remaining Georgian shepherds. Georgia started advertising the breed using television broadcasting and printing articles about Georgian shepherds in order to popularize the breed. Following the Soviet collapse, Georgia began to popularise this dog. Today, the goal is to breed another rare Georgian shepherd, Georgia's ancient white shepherd. Georgian shepherds are still used in dog fighting.

The episode originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 19, 2012. It was written by Owen Ellickson and was directed by Charles McDougall. The episode guest starred Lindsey Broad and Eleanor Seigler. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Robert California (James Spader) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries to make Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) jealous by flirting with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of his massive home. \\"Pool Party\\" received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many criticizing the episode's lack of a finite plot. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Pool Party\\" drew 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, marking a slight increase from the previous episode, \\"Trivia\\". The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis After Robert California (James Spader) is forced to sell his mansion at the behest of his ex-wife following his divorce, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) suggests that he have an office pool party. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes his girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler) to the party and brings an engagement ring his Jessica-approving mother gave him, hoping to propose. The ring goes missing from Andy's pants and he is horrified that he cannot find it. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) later find the ring and decide, based on the superstition of finding a lost ring, that it must be destroyed, setting it in the pool atop a tiny pyre. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), having been told by Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) that Andy followed her home after the Christmas party, decides to make Andy jealous by flirting with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight initially refuses, but, after realizing that Erin's choosing him as her co-conspirator is flattering to his attractiveness, agrees to help. The two flirt outrageously whenever Andy is close by, but Andy does not notice. To ensure Andy's attention, Erin and Dwight challenge Andy and Jessica to a series of chicken fights in the pool. After several defeats, Erin is so determined to win a match that she pushes Dwight to the point where he passes out in the water, ending the game. In a final attempt to make Andy jealous, Dwight tells Andy he wants to pursue a romance with Erin but wants to avoid an \\"Angela-type situation\\" between them. Andy assures Dwight that he and Erin are through but, at the mention of Dwight having sex with Erin that very night, he balks and suggests that Dwight take things slowly instead, leading Dwight to pointedly tell him \\"You're an idiot.\\" Erin later swims up to Andy with the lost ring, having recognized the Bernard family seal. Andy admits that he has doubts about proposing to Jessica, making Erin very happy. While most of the employees are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the guys - Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) - a tour of his massive home, spending most of the time mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild Bacchanalias. Ruing that his wine cellar will only \\"go to the lawyers\\" if left undrunk, he opens it to those at the party, who proceed to get drunk with him. Oscar bonds with Toby after he notices Toby's great wine choice, though Toby just picked it randomly. Toby plays along, glad to be making a friend, but laments the consequences he will later have to face. Jim had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay for the duration of the tour; in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Gabe and Ryan brown-nose Robert throughout the entire night. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe and Ryan. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed, even driving on the lawn and running over a mailbox backing out. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out. Production The episode was written by co-producer Owen Ellickson, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his seventh directing credit for the series. The episode also marks the sixth appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. Due to Jenna Fischer's actual pregnancy, Pam did not appear in the episode. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Erin and Dwight taking turns suggestively massaging and stretching each other, Erin talking to the camera about her convoluted relationship with Andy, and Robert shows his guests his \\"shame\\" room. Cultural references The songs \\"Big White Elephant\\" and \\"Model Homes\\" by the band In-Flight Safety were featured during scenes at the party. The song \\"Can't Complain\\" by Bomb the Music Industry! appeared around 14 minutes in. Many of the references were a result of Robert California bemoaning his position in life. He mentions early on in the episode that, \\"The 1% are hurting too\\", a reference to the slogan of the Occupy movement. During the tour of his home theater, California explained that he had it created to watch Caligula, Last Tango in Paris, and Emmanuelle 2, but that the last two movies he watched in there were Marley & Me and On Golden Pond. Reception Ratings \\"Pool Party\\" originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 19, 2012. The episode was viewed by an estimated 6.02 million viewers and received a 3 rating/7% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode marked a slight increase in ratings compared to the previous episode, \\"Trivia.\\" Even though \\"Pool Party\\" was the highest rated NBC television episode of the night, it finished third in its time slot behind Grey's Anatomy (3.4 rating/8% share) and the CBS drama Person of Interest (3.3 rating/8% share) in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and ahead of the Fox drama series The Finder and The CW drama series The Secret Circle. It was the last episode of The Office to be viewed by more than 6 million viewers. Reviews Many reviewers rated the episode very highly. WhatCulture critic Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode four out of five stars and wrote, \\"Now that's what I'm talking about ‚Äì few things are better in art than having your expectations overturned and 'The Pool Party' pleasantly surprised me with the efficacy of its execution.\\" Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, \\"I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble ‚Äì and the sharp writing.\\" Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after \\"Trivia.\\" In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, \\"[the pool party] storyline itself was just OK ... Ellie Kemper was hilarious.\\" Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl swims. A variety of reviewers found the cold- opening, featuring Stanley and Dwight combining to prank Jim's attempt to get Stanley to laugh by placing meatballs in Dwight's desk, funny. Among critical reviewers the episode's lack of a cohesive plot was the top complaint. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, saying, Pool Party' was so loosely structured that it relied heavily on the characters to carry the narrative, and the result was some languid storytelling which gave me way too much time to think about missed opportunities, failed experiments, and the increasing burden of a show without any momentum.\\" Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote, \\"There were bits and pieces of each story that worked in 'Pool Party,' but neither Robert's stroll through parties never had, nor Erin's endeavor to make Andy jealous, came together to make completely funny or interesting tales.\\" The Huffington Post wrote that, \\"Once [at the titular pool part], the plot bits were so loose it might have been difficult for casual fans to follow it all.\\" Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, Pool Party' was one of those episodes where you can tell the writers didn't know what else to do. ... This is filler, really, which unfortunately tends to be unavoidable when you do 22-episode seasons and you're eight years in.\\" Many reviews were critical of the continued Erin-Andy romance taking center-stage. McNutt wrote, \\"I still really do not care about Andy and Erin as a relationship. The show's approach to this storyline ... is to have Andy enjoying a fairly normal evening with his girlfriend Jessica while Erin acts like a crazy person in an effort to get his attention.\\" Forecella noted that, while the Erin and Dwight pairing was funny, their attempts to make Andy jealous were not successful, as Andy's sub- plots were deemed not funny and \\"boring.\\" References External links *\\"Pool Party\\" at NBC.com  The Office (American season 8) episodes 2012 American television episodes ","title":"Pool Party (The Office)"},{"id":"34224815","text":"Robert Crook was an American politician.

Football career Middleton was born in Portsmouth and attended Brune Park School in Gosport, where he played in goal for the school team and represented Gosport & Fareham Schools. In December 1967, he joined Southampton as an associate schoolboy, signing as an apprentice in October 1969 and as a professional in July 1970. He made his debut for Southampton Reserves on 13 December 1969, when he conceded five goals at Birmingham City. By 1973 he was the regular reserve team 'keeper and made his first-team debut in place of the injured Eric Martin on 25 August 1973 (the opening day of the 1973‚Äì74 season); after keeping goal for the first three matches of the season (one draw, two victories), Middleton lost his place to the fit again Martin. The signing of Ian Turner in March 1974 pushed Middleton down the order and in March 1975 he went on loan to Torquay United, where he made ten league appearances before returning to The Dell. It was not until the start of the 1975‚Äì76 season that Middleton was able to command a regular place in the first team. He played the first 17 matches of the season before \\"suffering a crisis of confidence\\" leading to the recall of Turner in November 1975. Saints went on to win the FA Cup with Turner in goal, defeating Manchester United in the final. At the start of the 1976‚Äì77 season, Turner injured his knee and manager Lawrie McMenemy signed, first, Colin Boulton and then Jimmy Montgomery on loan, with Middleton making a few appearances before Peter Wells was signed from Nottingham Forest in December. In May 1977, Middleton was released and joined Portsmouth. At the time he expressed his delight at joining his home-town club and criticised McMenemy's policy of signing ageing stars. His career at Pompey started well but after making a mistake in an FA Cup tie at Swansea City in December he conceded 12 goals in the next three league matches and was dropped. At the end of the season, he decided to retire from professional football. Later career After retiring from football, he ran a public house in Portsmouth but in 2003 he was a financial advisor for a building society in Fareham.

It was produced after the massive success of Chrisye's debut solo album Sabda Alam (Nature's Order) and soon after the death of Amin Widjaja, one of the founders of Musica Studios. Songwriting was handled by Chrisye, Jockie Soerjoprajogo, and Guruh Soekarnoputra. Backing vocals were provided by rising star Rafika Duri. Chrisye, although shocked by Amin's passing and feeling little passion for the music, provided the vocals, mixing pop and jazz; he also hit high notes on \\"Kehidupanku\\" (\\"My Life'). Three drummers played on the album. Chrisye's childhood friend Keenan Nasution played drums on \\"Kehidupanku\\", while Jimmy Manopo played drums on \\"Angkuh\\" (\\"Arrogance\\"); Fariz RM played drums for the rest of the album. The title of the song was decided by a vote.

The album was poorly received. After the failure of the album, Chrisye asked several other artists why Percik Pesona could have failed so badly. In reply, they said that the failure was two-fold. Firstly, new singers with successful first albums often emulate only the positive aspects of the first release, assuming that those are the reason it was successful; they were also under pressure to succeed.

Marvin laid out the settlement of Empire City on the Tuolumne River in Stanislaus County, California (at that time in Tuolumne County). It became the county seat of the new Stanislaus County in 1854, and an army supply center.Mildred Brooke Hoover, Historic Spots in California (1990), p. 489; Google Books. Marvin was the first California State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He came to San Jose at the end of 1850 to assume the position, finding nothing of which he could take charge.Kevin Starr, Richard J. Orsi, Rooted in Barbarous Soil: people, culture, and community in Gold Rush California (2000), p. 229; Google Books. There was a legislative vacuum, which he proceeded to fill through the state legislature in stop-gap fashion, having consulted John C. Pelton who had recently set up a school in San Francisco.San Francisco Museum page.Starr and Orsi, p. 231; Google Books. A clumsy and much amended school bill of 1851 was signed into law by Governor John McDougall, as California's first schools legislation. Financial problems remained for public education, and Marvin had the state vote $50,000 in 1852. A second school law created a board of education.David Tyack, Thomas James, Aaron Benavot, Law and the Shaping of Public Education, 1785‚Äì1954 (1991), pp. 233‚Äì4; Google Books. At the 1853 state Democratic convention, Paul K. Hubbs was nominated for Superintendent of Public Instruction ahead of Marvin.Winfield J. Davis, History of Political Conventions in California, 1849‚Äì1892 (1893), p. 24; archive.org. A John G. Marvin Elementary School is now in San Diego, founded in 1956.www.joincalifornia.com page for John G. Marvin.www.publicschoolreview.com. Concurrently with his activities on behalf of education, Marvin associated with Jim Savage. At the end of the Mariposa War, he became quartermaster of the King's River Reservation, and business partner of Savage.William B. Secrest, When the Great Spirit Died: the destruction of the California Indians, 1850‚Äì1860 (2002), p. 163; Google Books. Marvin was present at the quarrel between Savage and Walter Harvey in 1852, when Harvey shot Savage dead.Carl Parcher Russell, One Hundred Years in Yosemite: The Story of a Great Park and its Friends (1957), p. 30. Death He died in the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1855, or in some sources 1857. Works Marvin's best-known work is his Legal Bibliography, or A thesaurus of American, English, Irish, and Scotch law books (1847). It was preceded by an 1843 edition of a work on international law by Sir James Mackintosh, with reading list, and an 1846 Catalogue of the Harvard Law Library including recent accessions. The Bibliography is alphabetical by author, with a topical index, and includes evaluative comments on the works, drawing on numerous sources. Despite the impression given by its short title, the Bibliography was an attempt to integrate other legal works into the Anglo-American tradition.

Classification The bacterial nature of this organism was recognized by Thaxter in 1892, who grouped it among the Chrondromyces. It had been described several times before, but had been misclassified as a member of the fungi imperfecti. More recent investigations have shown that, contrary to Thaxter's classification, this organism is not closely related to Chrondromyces, and Stigmatella is currently recognized as a separate genus. Of the three major subgroups of the myxobacteria, Myxococcus, Nannocystis, and Chrondromyces, Stigmatella is most closely aligned with Myxococcus. Life cycle Three species of myxobacteria: Chondromyces crocatus (figs. 7-11), Stigmatella aurantiaca (figs. 12-19) and Melittangium lichenicola (figs. 20-23). S. aurantiaca, like other myxobacterial species, has a complex life cycle including social gliding (swarming), fruiting body formation, and predatory feeding behaviors. The bacteria do not swim, but glide on surfaces leaving slime trails, forming a mobile biofilm. It commonly grows on the surface of rotting soft woods or fungi, where it may form bright orange patches. During the vegetative portion of their life cycles, swarming enables coordinated masses of myxobacteria to pool their secretions of extracellular digestive enzymes which are used to kill and consume prey microorganisms, a bacterial \\"wolfpack\\" effect. The best studied of the myxobacteria, Myxococcus xanthus, has been shown to actively surround prey organisms, trapping them in pockets where they can be consumed. Roaming flares of M. xanthus can detect clumps of prey bacteria at a distance, making turns towards the clumps and moving directly towards them. Like other myxobacterial species, S. aurantiaca survives periods of starvation by undergoing a developmental process whereby the individuals of a swarm aggregate to form fruiting bodies (not to be confused with those in fungi). Within the fruiting bodies, a certain fraction of the cells differentiate into myxospores, which are dormant cells resistant to drying and temperatures up to 90 ¬∞C. Differentiation into fruiting bodies appears to be mediated by contact- mediated signaling. Under laboratory growth conditions, the ability to undergo differentiation to form fruiting bodies is rapidly lost unless the cultures are regularly forced to fruit by transferring to starvation media. Shaker cultures of S. aurantiaca permanently lose the ability to fruit. The complex life cycle of myxobacteria is reminiscent of the life cycle of eukaryotic cellular slime molds. Genome structure Taxonomic identifier: 378806 See also: NCBI UniProtKB S. aurantiaca DW4/3-1, a common laboratory strain, has been completely sequenced (See NCBI record link given above). Its circular DNA chromosome consists of 10.26 million base pairs and has a GC content of 67.5%. 8407 genes have been identified, coding for 8352 proteins. Cell structure The vegetative cells of S. aurantiaca are elongated rods typically measuring about 5-8 Œºm long and 0.7-0.8 Œºm wide. The fine structure resembles that of other gram negative bacteria. The cell surface consists of a cytoplasmic membrane with a typical triple layered organization and a cell wall. The cell wall consists of an outer triple layer and third dense monolayer in the periplasm. The myxospores are short, optically refractile rods measuring about 2.6-3.5 Œºm by 0.9-1.2 Œºm. The brightly colored, red or orange fruiting bodies comprise 1 to 20 spherical or ovoid cysts measuring 40-60 Œºm by 25-45 Œºm on top of a stalk measuring 60 to 140 Œº high. Each red-brown cyst contains thousands of myxospores surrounded by thick, fibrous capsules. Dispersal of cysts is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than as isolated cells. The stalks consist mostly of tubules which may represent the debris of lysed swarm cells, as well as some unlysed cells; very little fibrous material interpretable as slime is seen. Ecology S. aurantiaca is found on rotting wood or fungi and is only rarely found in soil samples. Secreted and non- secreted proteins involved in their feeding behaviors, either identified directly or speculatively identified on the basis of proteome analysis, include enzymes capable of breaking down a wide selection of peptidoglycans, polysaccharides, proteins and other cellular detritus. Various other secreted compounds possibly involved in predation include antibiotics such as stigmatellin, which is toxic for yeast and filamentous fungi but not most bacteria, and aurafuron A and B, which inhibits the growth of various filamentous fungi. Stigmatella species hence appear in nature to help decompose otherwise insoluble biological debris. It is only distantly related to the cellulolytic myxobacteria, does not produce cellulases, and is strongly bacteriolytic. Therefore, Stigmatella consumes organisms that feed on wood rather that feeding on wood directly. Besides bacteria, its production of antifungal antibiotics suggests that Stigmatella species may feed on yeasts and fungi as well, or alternatively, may suggest that Stigmatella competes with fungi for shared resources. By producing antimicrobial compounds, Stigmatella may play a role in maintaining the balance of the microbial population in its habitat. Current Research Model system for development Myxobacteria are distinguished from most bacteria by their remarkable range of social behaviors, and as a result, multiple laboratories have taken up studies of these bacteria as a prokaryotic paradigm for differentiation processes and signal transduction. Most studies on social behavior in the myxobacteria have focused on M. xanthus, which has provided an excellent system amenable to many classical genetic experimental approaches. The fruiting bodies of M. xanthus are relatively simple mounds, and the considerably more elaborate fruiting structures produced by S. aurantiaca has led to S. aurantiaca being considered an excellent complementary system to M. xanthus, especially given the advent of contemporary means of genomic analysis. Most of the 95 known M. xanthus development-specific genes are highly conserved in S. aurantiaca. Genes for entire signal transduction pathways important for fruiting body formation in M. xanthus are conserved in S. aurantiaca, whereas only a few are conserved in Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans, a non-fruiting member of the order Myxococcales. Various genes have been identified in S. aurantiaca involved in the process of fruiting body formation, including fbfA, which encodes a polypeptide homologous to chitin synthases, fbfB, a gene encoding a putative galactose oxidase, various genes including those encoding tRNAAsp and tRNAVal located at the attB locus (a phage attachment site), and so forth. These genes play a variety of roles in the developmental cycle. For example, in experiments where the fbFA gene was deactivated, the bacterium formed structured clumps instead of fruiting bodies. To control formation of the elaborate and spatially complex multicellular structure which is the fruiting body, the cells must exchange signals during the entire process. In M. xanthus, various signal molecules involved in this process have been identified. In S. aurantiaca, Stevens (1982) identified an extracellular, diffusible signaling molecule (pheromone) that could substitute for light in stimulating fruiting body maturation. A few years later, the structure of this molecule, a hydroxy ketone named stigmolone, was determined by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Besides signaling via exchange of diffusible substances, cell-cell signaling can be mediated by contact through the activity of surface located macromolecules. An example of this in S. aurantiaca would be the csgA homolog to the M. xanthus gene, which is bound to the cell envelope. The csgA gene product helps the cells to stay together during development and regulates motility of the cells. Pxr sRNA is a regulatory RNA which downregulates genes responsible for the formation of fruiting bodies in M. xanthus, and a homolog has been noted in S. aurantiaca. Another short nucleic acid that has been speculatively linked to cell‚Äìcell recognition is multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). Sequence comparison of msDNAs from M. xanthus, S. aurantiaca, and other bacteria reveal conserved and hypervariable domains reminiscent of conserved and hypervariable sequences found in allorecognition molecules. Another means for intercellular signaling could be via the exchange of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). These vesicles are produced from the outer membrane of myxobacterial cells and are found in large quantities within bacterial biofilms. OMVs appear to play a variety of roles in myxobacterial swarming, predation, and development. Natural secondary metabolites Natural products have been the source of most of the active ingredients in medicine, and continue to be an important source despite the advent of automated high-throughput screening methods for drug discovery in synthetic compounds. Historically, actinomycetes and fungi have been the major source of microbial secondary metabolites found useful as starting points for the development of new drugs, but the last several decades have seen myxobacteria come to the forefront of drug research. The pharmaceutical interest in these organisms comes from their production of a wide variety of structurally unique metabolites with interesting biological activities. The epothilones, derived from the myxobacterium Sporangium cellulosum, represent a new, recently approved class of cancer drugs. Other myxobacterial compounds of potential pharmaceutical interest include disorazol, tubulysin, rhizopodin, chondramid, the aurafurons, tuscolid, tuscuron, and dawenol, chivosazol, soraphen, myxochelin, and the leupyrrins. S. aurantiaca has been the source of several of these bioactive compounds, including myxothiazol, an inhibitor of the electron transport chain, dawenol, a polyene metabolite, stigmatellin, an antifungal agent, the antifungals aurafuron A and B, and the iron siderophores myxochelin A and B.

History The Groult family moved to the Clos de la Hurvani√®re in the 18th century. Pierre Groult (1830-1918) began to distill cider around 1850. Pierre Groult expanded production by purchasing a pot still and building a cellar. He also began to bottle the Calvados; previously it had only been sold in casks as was common practice at the time. Upon succeeding his father, Leon Groult (1874-1923) built a further aging cellar to meet the increasing demand. Roger Groult (1905-1988), son of Leon, expanded the distillery. In 1975 he established the public company \\"Calvados Roger Groult SA\\" for the production and marketing of calvados. Once at the helm, Roger's son, Jean-Pierre Groult (1946-2008), created a company that allowed him to buy the neighbourhood apples to increase his production. He built in 1980 the two largest cellars of the area in order to store and age more significant amounts of calvados. This allowed him to develop the company's stocks for export and start marketing them to hotels and restaurants abroad. Jean-Pierre Groult was succeeded in 2008 by his son Jean-Roger. Jean-Roger Groult is a founding member of a new Calvados association, Esprit Calvados. Esprit Calvados is the association of 5 family owned Calvados estates in Pays d' Auge.

Overview  In the first half of the 18th century the Bhagyakul Roy family entered into the salt business. They rapidly acquired vast fortunes and became chief landlords (or zamindars) of Bhagyakul and many other estates in the undivided Bengal (pre-1947). Simultaneously, Zamindari estates spread out over the undivided Bengal and Bihar. The family did not stick to the feudalistic Zamindari system, instead they established an inland water and stream navigation services with shipping dockyards. The Bhagyakul Roy's also founded one of the biggest jute mills called M/S. Prem Chand Jute Mills Ltd, and the United Industrial Bank. Though originally 'Kundu,' they were awarded the title of Roy Bahadur to Sri Gunendra Krishna Roy, one of the family members and the rest with 'Roy/Raychowdhary' by the British colonial government. The family now uses its surname as Ray / Roy. A few family members were also honoured with the title of 'Raja' by the British government. Later the family diversified into steamships, banking, real estate, and manufacturing industries. Many in the family entered public life, developed professional careers, and created institutions of social importance that collectively constitute a significant influence on the Bengali [who?] society even today. [citation needed] The family was instrumental in setting up the East Bengal Club in August 1920. It is also known that the family provided Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar with a loan to start the Vidyasagar College. During the colonial period, the family contributed towards the freedom struggle by actively participating in the Sixth Indian National Congress session (Tivoli Garden, Calcutta, December 1890) and opposing the partition of Bengal.

Borough - see A history of the ecumenical movement, Volume 1; Rouse R., Neill S. and Fey, H.E.: SPCK, 1970. The Church Intelligencer (Volume 23, Issue 11, November 1906) expressed its concern in an article entitled A New Disorder in the Church ‚Äì The Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches Union: \\"Simultaneously with the appearance of the Report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline, there came into existence a new Ritualistic society, the composition of which is as full of significance as the present crisis in our National Church\\". from its foundation in July 1906 until 1914 and thereafter of its successor, the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association.The Union published annual reports between 1906 and 1914 and a magazine, Eirene, which Fynes-Clinton edited for some years from 1908 to 1914. By 1914 it had approximately 2,000 members in Britain and a branch in the United States. See The Times, 24 October 1908, p. 19, column F for a report of the Union's early activities. It merged in 1914 with the Eastern Church Association, which had been founded at the residence of William Denton at 48 Finsbury Circus on 13 April 1863. Fynes-Clinton remained active in the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association until 1933, when he was ousted from its leadership following his call for reunion with Rome. Godfrey Benson, 1st Baron Charnwood settled the issue in a private conversation with Fynes- Clinton. \\"He agreed to resign the Hon. Secretaryship, but to continue on the Committee if desired. In a long and, to me, extremely difficult conversation, no man, from whom I profoundly and amiably differed, could have inspired more personal respect in me than he did.\\" (Sobornost incorporating Eastern churches review, Fellowship of St. Alban and St. Sergius, Volume 1 No. 1, 1979).

Isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which uses NAD+ as the electron acceptor and the other NADP+. Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. Each NADP+-dependent isozyme is a homodimer. The protein encoded by this gene is the NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in the cytoplasm and peroxisomes. It contains the PTS-1 peroxisomal targeting signal sequence. The presence of this enzyme in peroxisomes suggests roles in the regeneration of NADPH for intraperoxisomal reductions, such as the conversion of 2,4-dienoyl- CoAs to 3-enoyl-CoAs, as well as in peroxisomal reactions that consume 2-oxoglutarate, namely the alpha-hydroxylation of phytanic acid. The cytoplasmic enzyme serves a significant role in cytoplasmic NADPH production. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]  Structure  IDH1 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes, the other two being IDH2 and IDH3, and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which are IDH1, IDH2, IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G. IDH1 forms an asymmetric homodimer in the cytoplasm and carries out its function through two hydrophilic active sites formed by both protein subunits. Each subunit or monomer is composed of three domains: a large domain (residues 1‚Äì103 and 286‚Äì414), a small domain (residues 104‚Äì136 and 186‚Äì285), and a clasp domain (residues 137 to 185). The large domain contains a Rossmann fold, while the small domain forms an Œ±/Œ≤ sandwich structure, and the clasp domain folds as two stacked double-stranded anti- parallel Œ≤-sheets. A Œ≤-sheet joins the large and small domains and is flanked by two clefts on opposite sides. The deep cleft, also known as the active site, is formed by the large and small domains of one subunit and a small domain of the other subunit. This active site includes the NADP-binding site and the isocitrate-metal ion-binding site. The shallow cleft, also referred to as the back cleft, is formed by both domains of one subunit and participates in the conformational changes of homodimeric IDH1. Finally, the clasp domains of both subunits intertwine to form a double layer of four-stranded anti- parallel Œ≤-sheets linking together the two subunits and the two active sites. Furthermore, conformational changes to the subunits and a conserved structure at the active site affect the activity of the enzyme. In its open, inactive form, the active site structure forms a loop while one subunit adopts an asymmetric open conformation and the other adopts a quasi-open conformation. This conformation enables isocitrate to bind the active site, inducing a closed conformation that also activates IDH1. In its closed, inactive form, the active site structure becomes an Œ±-helix that can chelate metal ions. An intermediate, semi-open form features this active site structure as a partially unraveled Œ±-helix. There is also a type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence at its C-terminal that targets the protein to the peroxisome.  Function  As an isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH1 catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield Œ±-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG) as part of the TCA cycle in glucose metabolism. This step also allows for the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Since NADPH and Œ±-KG function in cellular detoxification processes in response to oxidative stress, IDH1 also indirectly participates in mitigating oxidative damage. In addition, IDH1 is key to Œ≤-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in the peroxisomes of liver cells. IDH1 also participates in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Notably, IDH1 is the primary producer of NADPH in most tissues, especially in brain. Within cells, IDH1 has been observed to localize to the cytoplasm, peroxisome, and endoplasmic reticulum. Under hypoxic conditions, IDH1 catalyzes the reverse reaction of Œ±-KG to isocitrate, which contributes to citrate production via glutaminolysis. Isocitrate can also be converted into acetyl-CoA for lipid metabolism.  Mutation  IDH1 mutations are heterozygous, typically involving an amino acid substitution in the active site of the enzyme in codon 132. The mutation results in a loss of normal enzymatic function and the abnormal production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). It has been considered to take place due to a change in the binding site of the enzyme. 2-HG has been found to inhibit enzymatic function of many alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenases, including histone and DNA demethylases, causing widespread changes in histone and DNA methylation and potentially promoting tumorigenesis.  Clinical Significance  Mutations in this gene have been shown to cause metaphyseal chondromatosis with aciduria. Mutations in IDH1 are also implicated in cancer. Originally, mutations in IDH1 were detected in an integrated genomic analysis of human glioblastoma multiforme. Since then it has become clear that mutations in IDH1 and its homologue IDH2 are among the most frequent mutations in diffuse gliomas, including diffuse astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma, oligoastrocytoma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and secondary glioblastoma. Mutations in IDH1 are often the first hit in the development of diffuse gliomas, suggesting IDH1 mutations as key events in the formation of these brain tumors. Glioblastomas with a wild- type IDH1 gene have a median overall survival of only 1 year, whereas IDH1-mutated glioblastoma patients have a median overall survival of over 2 years. Tumors of various tissue types with IDH1/2 mutations show improved responses to radiation and chemotherapy. The best-studied mutation in IDH1 is R132H, which has been show to act as a tumor suppressor. In addition to being mutated in diffuse gliomas, IDH1 has also been shown to harbor mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia. The IDH1 mutation is considered a driver alteration and occurs early during tumorigenesis, in specific in glioma and glioblastoma multiforme, its possible use as a new tumour-specific antigen to induce antitumor immunity for the cancer treatment has recently been prompted. A tumour vaccine can stimulate the body‚Äôs immune system, upon exposure to a tumour-specific peptide antigen, by activation or amplification of a humoral and cytotoxic immune response targeted at the specific cancer cells. The study of Schumacher et al. has been shown that this attractive target (the mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1) from an immunological perspective represents a potential tumour-specific neoantigen with high uniformity and penetrance and could be exploited by immunotherapy through vaccination. Accordingly, some patients with IDH1-mutated gliomas demonstrated spontaneous peripheral CD4+ T-cell responses against the mutated IDH1 region with generation B-cell producing antibodies. Vaccination of MHC-humanized transgenic mice with mutant IDH1 peptide induced an IFN-Œ≥ CD4+ T-helper 1 cell response, indicating an endogenous processing through MHC class II, and production of antibodies targeting mutant IDH1. Tumour vaccination, both prophylactic and therapeutic, resulted in growth suppression of transplanted IDH1-expressing sarcomas in MHC-humanized mice. This in vivo data shows a specific and potent immunologic response in both transplanted and existing tumours. As a drug target Mutated and normal forms of IDH1 had been studied for drug inhibition both in silico and in vitro, and some drugs are being developed (e.g. Ivosidenib). Ivosidenib was approved by the FDA in July 2018 for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH1 mutation.

His nephew Vladimir Filatov was a prominent ophthalmologist.  Career  Having graduated from the Moscow University, he practised as a country doctor in his native region. In 1872‚Äì1874, Filatov took additional training in Vienna, Berlin, Heidelberg, and Prague. In 1876, he upheld a thesis on bronchitis and pneumonia, and obtained a doctor degree. Nil Filatov is most famous for describing infectious mononucleosis (also known as Filatov's disease) in 1887 and Dukes' disease (sometimes referred as Dukes- Filatov disease) in 1885; he was also one of the first to observe Koplik's spots (1895). In cooperation with Georgy Gabrichevsky he introduced serumal treatment of diphtheria in 1894. He created a number of handbooks on paediatrics, which were not only popular in Russia, but also translated into German, French, Italian, Czech and Hungarian. In 1892, Filatov established the Society of Paediatricians in Moscow. The oldest children's hospitals in Moscow (where Filatov worked, now #13), and in Russia (#5, based in St. Petersburg) are named after him.

Structure The ACSF3 gene is located on the 16th chromosome, with its specific location being 16q24.3. The gene contains 17 exons. ASCL4 encodes a 64.1 kDa protein that is composed of 576 amino acids; 20 peptides have been observed through mass spectrometry data.]  Function  This gene encodes a member of the acetyl‚ÄîCoA synthetase family of enzymes that activate fatty acids by catalyzing the formation of a thioester linkage between fatty acids and coenzyme A. The encoded protein is localized to mitochondria, has high specificity for malonate and methylmalonate and possesses malonyl-CoA synthetase activity.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been shown to cause combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria. Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) is a condition characterized by high levels of malonic acid and methylmalonic acid, because deficiencies in this gene cause these metabolites to not be broken down. The disease is typically diagnosed by either genetic testing or higher levels of methylmalonic acid than malonic acid in the urine, although both are elevated. The disorder typically presents symptoms early in childhood, first starting with high levels of acid in the blood (ketoacidosis). The disorder can also present as involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), developmental delay, an inability to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and coma. Some affected children can even have microcephaly. Other people with CMAMMA do not develop signs and symptoms until adulthood. These individuals usually have neurological problems, such as seizures, loss of memory, a decline in thinking ability, or psychiatric diseases.

In club football, he scored 46 goals from 90 appearances in the Football League playing for Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City and Crewe Alexandra. He also played in the Southern League for Pontypridd, Coventry City, Norwich City, Brighton & Hove Albion (before their admission to the Football League) and Mid Rhondda United, in the Free State League for Shelbourne and Fordsons, and in the Midland League for Boston Town. Life and career Doran was born in Belfast in 1896. His family moved to England, and the young Doran was on the books of Southern League clubs New Brompton and Pontypridd and non-League club Newcastle Empire before signing for Coventry City in May 1914. He scored twice in his only appearance for that club in the Southern League before enlisting in the Army in September. Doran went on to serve in the 17th Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment ‚Äì the so-called Footballers' Battalion ‚Äì and was awarded the Military Medal. After the war, Doran had brief spells as a guest with Brentford and Newcastle United, before joining Southern League club Norwich City, under the management of his wartime commanding officer, Major Frank Buckley. By March 1920, he had scored 18 goals for Norwich, already enough to make him the club's top scorer for the season, when Charlie Webb, manager of Buckley's former club Brighton & Hove Albion, persuaded him to move to the south coast. In the ten remaining games, Doran scored ten goals, a total that gave him the rare achievement of being the top scorer of two clubs in the same season. The following year, when Albion and the other Southern League teams were absorbed into the new Football League Third Division, Doran's goalscoring continued. He was the club's top scorer, with 22 goals, and he began the 1921‚Äì22 season with 16 of the first 17 goals scored by the team, including two hat-tricks and five goals in a 7‚Äì0 defeat of Northampton Town. Such goalscoring attracted attention from bigger clubs, and after finishing the season as Albion's top scorer for the third time, he signed for Manchester City of the First Division. Doran made only three appearances for Manchester City, scoring once, before the club attempted to convert him to centre half. He then moved back to the Third Division for a few months with Crewe Alexandra. Short spells followed with Mid Rhondda United in the Southern League. In 1924 he joined Free State League club Shelbourne. He scored the third goal as Shelbourne defeated Athlone Town 4‚Äì0 in the semifinal of the 1925 Free State Cup, and appeared on the losing side in the final. He also played for Fordsons in the Free State League before finishing his playing career with Boston Town in the Midland League. He then returned to Ireland where he coached Waterford United. After retiring from football, he became a publican in the north-east of England, and died in Sunderland of the effects of tuberculosis, aged 44.

Early life  He began his early studies in his native town of Luarca, then he went to the University of Oviedo to study law. During his university years he experienced the excitement of the Republican Party in Oviedo which was very common in the intellectual circles at that time. Some of his professors were Leopoldo Alas \\"Clar√≠n\\" and Adolfo √Ålvarez Buylla, a knowledgeable Marxist and founder of the Sociology Seminary at the Faculty‚Äôs Library. After Oviedo, Albornoz continued to Madrid where he was influenced by Francisco Giner de los R√≠os and the \\"Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza.\\" Throughout these years, his social and political beliefs were shaped and reinforced. He then returned to Luarca, where in 1899 he and Amalia Salas were married. April 29, 1900, in Luarca, the couple's first child, Maria de la Concepci√≥n (\\"Concha\\") was born. The next year came \\"Alvarito,\\" their son. Albornoz practiced law for ten years. He became more active with socialist activities and wrote for the \\"La Aurora Social,\\" a political newspaper in Asturias. In 1909, he became a member of Lerroux‚Äôs Radical Republican Party. He was elected to the Spanish parliament in 1910. Following the 1914 elections, Albornoz left politics and the Radical Republican Party to practice law and spend more time writing.  Political Career and the Second Spanish Republic  In 1929, when in the \\"C√°rcel Modelo of Madrid\\" Albornoz would found, along with Marcelino Domingo, the new Radical Socialist Republican Party (which, in 1934, would merge with other parties to become the Republican Left. In 1930, after the \\"Pact of San Sebastian,\\" Albornoz was arrested, imprisoned, and court martialed for Treason by the Supreme Court of War and Navy. His assigned defense attorney was Victoria Kent, the first woman to pass the Spanish bar. Albornoz was acquitted of all charges. Albornoz was a member of the elected Spanish Second Republic, and, after the king fled Spain, a member of the Provisional Revolutionary Committee of 1930, and chairman of the constitutional draft committee,\\" As the first president of the \\"Tribunal de Garant√≠as Constitucionales,\\" he eventually assumed responsibility for some of the reforms authorized by the new progressive constitution‚Äî‚Äìincluded the dissolution of the Jesuit Fraternal order, secular divorce, suppression of the State budget for the \\"cult and cleric,\\" and other provisions relating to the installation of a secular government. He also served as Minister of Justice and Minister of Public Works. July 27, 1936, he was named the Spanish Second Republica's Ambassador to Paris. By September, he was replaced and faced with returning to a Spain inflamed by Civil War.  Life in Exile  In 1939, Albornoz, Salas, and daughter Concha de Albornoz emigrated to Havana, Cuba; and finally to Mexico City. His son Alvarito, Alavarito's wife Maria Araceli, and their son later joined them. In exile, Albornoz Alvaro continued his representation for the Spanish Second Republic and with the Mexico City community of Spanish exiles. He was a member of Spanish Republican Action. He also helped found the Ateneo Salmer√≥n. He served on the committee of the Spanish Junta de Liberation, representing the Republican Left party, working closely with Indalecio Prieto. He continued to travel and advocate on behalf of the duly elected government of Spain. May 11, 1940, he was named President of the Republic of Spain in Exile (till June 27, 1945). He was also named Prime Minister from 1947 to 1951, two consecutive terms. He corresponded with people in France and the United States. He attended a United Nations conference representing the Second Spanish Republic government. But Franco‚Äîsupported by the Church and Industry‚Äîwas ensconced and Albornoz's work on behalf of the duly elected government came to no avail. Albornoz died Oct. 22, 1954, in Mexico City.  Family  Albornoz's nephew (son of his sister) was Severo Ochoa the winner of the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Arthur Kornberg. He was also the grand-uncle and god-father of Aurora de Albornoz, celebrated poet and literary critic.

Career 1970‚Äì1999 Gary Grainger's professional career took off with the formation of Strider. After two albums ‚Äì Misunderstood and Exposed and two extensive tours with The Faces in 1974, Grainger got his big break with Rod Stewart in 1976. The formation of the Rod Stewart group, including Jim Cregan, Phil Chen, Carmine Appice and Billy Peek, saw Grainger write key songs for the albums Foot Loose & Fancy Free, Blondes Have More Fun, and Foolish Behaviour. Throughout 1986 and 1987, Grainger worked with Roger Daltrey, with UK TV appearances on Number 73 and Saturday Live. He played on Daltrey's 1987 album, Can't Wait to See the Movie. When Daltrey resumed activity with The Who and suspended solo work, Grainger formed a band with Jimmy Copley and Jaz Lochrie. Grainger performed live and on TV appearances with Nick Lowe in support of Lowe's Party of One album in 1990. He also appeared on Lowe's 1994 album The Impossible Bird. In 1991, Grainger formed The Humans with Jess Roden, Jim Capaldi, Bill Burke and Nick Graham. The Humans recorded their first batch of songs at John Entwistle's Hammerhead studios, with Bob Pridden as producer and engineer, with Steve Winwood on Hammond Organ. Only \\"Railroad of Desire\\" was released from these recordings on 1995's self-titled album. The band performed regularly throughout the UK and Europe until the late 1990s. In the mid- nineties Grainger was recruited to produce and play guitar for the Brit Pop band The Face at the request of The Who's long-time crew member Bob Pridden. He played on the original recordings, during which time he recommended Zak Starkey for the sessions. For live shows, Grainger opted out and The Face used Gary Nuttall, who went on to become long-time guitarist for Robbie Williams. In 1998 Grainger formed Blues Club with Alan Rogan. Peter Hope-Evans of Medicine Head was on mouth organ and Kinks drummer Mick Avery joined. They were initially recorded and produced by Pete Townshend with Jess Roden on vocals. When Avery had other commitments, Chris Slade (AC/DC) joined on drums up until 2000. It was this line-up of Blues Club that appeared on BBC TV's Casualty programme. Blues Club continued for another decade, with Grainger's son Chris replacing Avery and Slade on drums. 2000‚Äìpresent In 2000, Grainger received a call to work with Kenney Jones. Initially collaborating for some charity gigs, the band proved popular and formed a more solid line-up featuring Boz Burrell on bass, Robert Hart on vocals. Formula One racing champion Damon Hill joined the band on many of the early gigs. Their first recording was the charity single \\"It's All About the Children\\" and was produced by the legendary Chris Kimsey. The single also featured Paul Young on vocals. Grainger played at the Ronnie Lane 2004 Tribute at the Royal Albert Hall onstage with Kenney Jones, Sam Brown, Ronnie Wood and Pete Townshend. In 2007, Roger Daltrey played corporate shows in Canada. Grainger was asked to join, playing Townshend's parts along with The Who's touring band of Zak Starkey, John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick, Simon Townsend and Phil Spalding played bass. From 2010 to 2012, Grainger resumed working with Rod Stewart bandmate Jim Cregan in a project called \\"Apart From Rod\\". Touring the UK and Europe, Apart From Rod was a presentation of duo's large catalogue of hits that they had written for Stewart, including Grainger's songs \\"Hot Legs\\", \\"Passion\\", and \\"I Was Only Joking\\". Musicians Gary Grainger has worked with B.A. Robertson, Damon Hill, Rod Stewart, Danny Bowes, Jess Roden, Jim Capaldi, John Entwistle, Kenney Jones, Nick Lowe, Paul Carrack, Paul Young, Pete Townshend, Ringo Starr, Robert Hart, Roger Daltrey, Ronnie Wood, Sam Brown, and Strider.

She later became a novelist, and is credited with writing over a dozen spy novels in addition to her memoirs and short stories. Early life Cnockaert was born in the village of Westrozebeke in the Belgian province of West Flanders, to Felix Cnockaert and his wife Marie-Louise Vanoplinus. She began studying at the medical school at Ghent University, but her studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I.Deborah E. Van Seters, McKenna, Marthe (1892‚Äìc.1969), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Accessed 30 December 2011. World War I In August 1914, German troops razed the village, burning her home down and temporarily separating her family. Having trained as a nurse, Cnockaert gained a job at a German military hospital located in the village, where she was valued for her medical training and her multi-lingual skills, speaking English and German as well as French and Flemish. She was awarded the Iron Cross by the Germans for her medical service. In 1915, she was transferred to the German Military Hospital in Roulers, where she was reunited with her family who had also moved there after the destruction of their home. Around this time, she was approached by a family friend and former neighbour, Lucelle Deldonck, who revealed to Cnockaert that she was a British intelligence agent, and wished to recruit her to an Anglo-Belgian intelligence network operating in the town. For two years, Cnockaert (codenamed \\"Laura\\") used her cover as a nurse and her frequent proximity to German military personnel‚Äîat both the hospital and as a waitress at her parents' caf√©‚Äîto gather important military intelligence for the British and their allies, which she passed on to other agents in local churches. She mostly worked with two other female Belgian spies: an elderly vegetable seller codenamed \\"Canteen Ma\\", and a letterbox agent codenamed \\"Number 63\\", both of whom helped her relay messages to and from British General Headquarters. Her exploits during the war included destroying a telephone line which a local priest was using to spy for the Germans; and obtaining details of a planned but cancelled visit by Kaiser Wilhelm II for a British aerial attack. At one stage, her German lodger, Otto, tried to recruit her to spy on the British. Cnockaert attempted to relay harmless but seemingly important information to him for a short time, but when operating as a double agent became too difficult, she arranged for him to be killed. She discovered a disused sewer tunnel system located underneath a German ammunition depot, and placed the explosives herself to destroy the ammo dump; however, this operation led to her exposure and capture when she lost her watch, engraved with her initials, while placing the dynamite. In November 1916, Cnockaert was sentenced to death for her espionage; however, her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment due to her Iron Cross honour. She served two years in a prison in Ghent, and was released in 1918 when the Armistice with Germany was declared, ending the war. After the war Cnockaert was awarded British, French and Belgian honours for gallantry for her espionage work‚Äîshe was mentioned in despatches on 8 November 1918 by Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in recognition of her intelligence work, as well as receiving a British certificate for gallantry from Winston Churchill; she was also made a member of the French and Belgian Legions of Honour. She married John \\"Jock\\" McKenna, a British army officer. Her memoir I Was a Spy! was ghost written by her husband and published under her married name in 1932. Churchill wrote the foreword for the book. The publication of her memoir was prompted by the visit of an English author who encouraged Marthe to write and publish details of her wartime experiences. Following a warm critical and popular reception of her memoirs and other espionage anecdotes, the McKennas published a string of over a dozen spy novels. Although published under Marthe's name, it is speculated that her husband was largely responsible for their writing. The couple moved to Manchester during World War II and, despite her retirement, she was listed in 'The Black Book' of prominent subjects to be arrested by the Nazis in the case of a successful invasion of Britain. The McKennas later returned to Marthe's family home in Westrozebeke and no further books were forthcoming when the McKennas' marriage ended around 1951. McKenna remained in Westrozebeke, and died in 1966. Portrayal in media Cnockaert was portrayed by Madeleine Carroll in Victor Saville's 1933 film I Was a Spy, based on her memoirs.

Its administrators were scheduled to be from the local Macanese community, replacing the previous Portuguese leadership at the former Liceu. Since its establishment the number of students had declined. Around 2012 this reversed and the student body count began to increase. the school has 577 students from 24 countries; around that period the number of students without a Portuguese background had increased. Curriculum The medium of instruction of most classes is Portuguese. In 2018 Valeria Koob, the president of the school's parent association, advocated for having outside-of-class expeditions for Mandarin Chinese classes.

Students who chose this school would have been prepared for education in universities in Portugal. History Circa 1998 the school occupied a campus in central Macau that had been designed by a well-known Portuguese architect. Cathryn H. Clayton, the author of Sovereignty at the Edge: Macau & the Question of Chineseness, wrote that compared to most schools in Macau, the Liceu's class sizes were small. She added that the faculty received good salaries and benefits and that the campus was among the most lavish and expensive to maintain. A large percentage of the students matriculated to universities with the majority moving on to European institutions, including those in Portugal itself. Clayton concluded that the school \\"reflected the conditions of advantage enjoyed by the Portuguese in Macau\\".

The New South Wales Ice Hockey Association is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia. History 1911: Club hockey begins in New South Wales The beginnings of club hockey in New South Wales occurred at the Sydney Glaciarium in 1911 and consisted of 3 original ice hockey clubs. * Corinthians * Ottawas * Wanderers 1922: New South Wales Ice Hockey Association From the Sydney Ice Hockey Club, the New South Wales Ice Hockey Association was formed, considered the first proper governing body in New South Wales for ice hockey. The original Sydney Ice Hockey Club decided to split up into 4 different teams under an association, the teams were: * North Sydney * South Sydney * Eastern Suburbs * Western Suburbs The intention was to hold competitions during the ice skating season and pick a New South Wales state representative team to play against Victoria for the Interstate Ice Hockey Series. The first match organised was a combined match where the North Sydney and South Sydney team would combine to play against the Eastern Suburbs and Western Suburbs combination team. National Competition 1909: The Goodall Cup The first ice hockey uniform for New South Wales 1909 The first ice hockey team representing New South Wales 1909 The first inter-state ice hockey championship was held between a state representative team from Victoria and from New South Wales. This tournament was a best-of-3 format and saw Victoria win the series 2 games to 1. New South Wales was represented by a newly formed team in 1909 and traveled to Melbourne on 29 August 1909 which marked the first national interstate competition for senior men's hockey in Australia. This was the year that 16-year-old John Edwin Goodall donated the J. E. Goodall Cup to the interstate series, the Victoria state team won the inaugural tournament to become the first Goodall Cup Champions, with Robert Jackson as the captain, who scored 3 goals in the second half of the final game. The first game of the series had a final score of 2-1 with New South Wales defeating Victoria. Friday 3 September 1909 the Victorian team defeated the New South Wales team 1-0, giving Victorian goaltender Charles Watt the first recorded shutout in Goodall Cup history. In the third game of the series both teams had won a game each. Victoria defeated New South Wales 6-1 and became the first team to win the interstate championship in Australia and the first to be awarded the Goodall Cup. Before World War I, which interrupted the Goodall Cup series in 1914, New South Wales won 2 out of 5 Goodall Cup championships held between 1909 and 1913. Jim Kendall dominated the Victorians in his first 2 years with New South Wales, helping them win 2 Goodall Cups back to back. When the Goodall Cup tournament resumed in 1921, New South Wales would win but Victoria would win the following year in 1922, captained by John Edwin Goodall. This was Victoria's last Goodall Cup win until 1947 where New South Wales would dominate the Goodall Cup inter-state tournaments. In 1952 the tournament expanded with the introduction of a team from Tasmania. The first time Tasmania competed in the inter-state tournament was 1 July 1952 against Victoria at the Hobart Glaciarium. Victoria would go on to win the Goodall Cup that year. The Goodall Cup continued to be awarded to the winners of the inter-state ice hockey champions until 2001. In 2002 the Goodall Cup was used as an award to the playoff champions in the Australian Ice Hockey League, which is the most elite national ice hockey league in Australia. For its centenary, the Goodall Cup was used again as an award for an inter-state ice hockey competition but was returned to be used the AIHL immediately after. 1922: The Gower Cup The first women's ice hockey team representing New South Wales 1922 The first inter-state women's ice hockey championship tournament was held in the first week in August 1922 between New South Wales and Victoria, New South Wales won the first game of the series 3-0. The first Women's ice hockey team representing New South Wales consisted of: * Miss E. Rea (Captain) * Miss V. Wallace * Miss M. Ive * Miss N. Kerr * Miss J. Hall * Miss E. Wallach * Mrs. B. W.

Near the end of his life he became Grand Master of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).  Life  Charles Philip was the third surviving son of the \\"Great Elector\\", Frederick William of Brandenburg (1620‚Äì1688) from his second marriage with Sophia Dorothea (1636‚Äì1689), the daughter of Philip, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. In 1693, Charles Philip proved himself at the Battle of Neerwinden and was promoted to Lieutenant General by his brother Frederick I. He participated in the War of the Palatine Succession at the head of an auxiliary contingent. He joined the main force of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia in Turin.Samuel Buchholtz: Versuch einer Geschichte der Churmarck Brandenburg von der ersten Erscheinung der deutschen Sennonen an bis auf jezige Zeiten, vols. 3-4, F. W. Birnstiel, 1767, p. 203 In Turin, he met Countess Caterina di Salmour (1670-1719), widow of Giovanni Gabaleone, Count di Salmour and daughter of Geofredo Alberico Balbiani, Marchese di Colcavagno by his wife, Marta-Maria Benso di Cavour, heiress of Isolabella. On the afternoon of 29 May 1695 three officers of Brandenburg's army, Col. Ludwig von Blumenthal, Lt. Col. von Hackeborn and Col. von Stille learned that Charles Philipp had lodged in the recently ruined Palace of Venaria, near Turin, where he was about to marry the Countess di Salmour in secret. They hurried towards La Venaria. As they neared the ch√¢teau, the Margrave‚Äôs Master of the Horse met them on the road and confirmed the rumour. The Margrave had invited a small gathering to his secret wedding, including three women who were friends of the Countess, her brother Flaminio Balbiano, and some local Torino notables; on the German side were a Prince of Hesse-Cassel and a Captain Beaupr√©, currently serving in Brandenburg‚Äôs army. The local priest Fr. Galli was summoned, and before him and in the presence of Abbot Alexander del Marro and the Chevalier Parella, they declared their determination to marry. But the priest refused to co-operate on the grounds that they were not his parishioners. The Abbot and Captain Beaupr√© fought; Staff intervened and the Margrave then fell upon the Master of Horse with drawn sword, who fled. Riding on, the three colonels came upon the Margrave, heading for the Countess‚Äô house in Turin in his carriage with his escort. They joined the cavalcade, and when they reached the destination the Prince‚Äôs advisors implored him not to carry on. Neither the Elector of Brandenburg, nor the Duke of Savoy recognized the marriage. To avoid diplomatic complications, Duke Victor Amadeus imprisoned Caterina in a convent. The Curia supported Charles Philip's claim that the marriage was legal, in the hope that he would convert to Catholicism. While the issue was still being debated, Charles Philip died of a fever or (it was said) of a broken heart. He was buried in the Hohenzollern family crypt in Berlin Cathedral. Two years later, Rome ruled that the marriage was valid. The Elector still did not recognize it. In 1707, Caterina married the Saxon general Count .

Preparation of a single portion may take up to six hours. Although the dish is traditionally prepared with clay, the recipe has evolved; for convenience and safety it is often baked with dough, oven bags, ceramic cooking pots, or convection ovens. It is reported that the then- President of the United States, Richard Nixon, liked the dish during his visit to China in 1972. Origin Beggar's chicken is very popular in China; many regions claim it as traditionally theirs. Most experts agree the dish originated in Hangzhou. The clay-wrapped method of slow cooking is thousands of years old. Various legends surround the origins of beggar's chicken. In one, a beggar stole a chicken from a farm but having no pot or utensils, he wrapped the bird in lotus leaves and packed clay or mud around it, set it in a hole where he had lit a fire, and buried it. When he dug up the chicken and cracked open the clay, he found the meat was tender and aromatic. In other versions, the beggar stole the chicken from the emperor and used the mud-hole method to avoid smoke that might attract the imperial guards. Alternatively, the emperor stopped to dine with the beggar and so enjoyed the dish that he added it to the imperial menu and the beggar prospered by selling the dish to locals. According to another legend, the dish was a childhood favorite of Emperor Gaozu of Han, who had been born a peasant. When he became emperor, the recipe became an imperial specialty. Preparation Today, dough is sometimes substituted for clay for the dish's preparation, though some recipes still call for a covering of non-toxic clay to retain moisture, and stuffed with various ingredients. It can be prepared in ovens, outdoor grills and smokers, and campfires. Non-toxic clay for preparing beggar's chicken can be obtained from hardware or arts and craft stores; however, cooks must pay attention when baking the dish with clay because if too much heat is used, \\"the earth may crack and it can be very dangerous\\" due to the pressure buildup in the clay shell. Preparing the dish with dough is safer; ceramic cooking pots can also be used to retain moisture, but these are expensive to purchase. Alternatively, an oven bag can be used when cooking it in a domestic oven. A foil wrapped beggar's chicken, being cooked alternatively in a contemporary convection oven instead of traditionally covered it in non-toxic clay and baked in a typical cooking oven or an outdoor smoker, in a Chinese American home in California. A convection oven can eliminate the need to cover the dish and allows it to cook evenly, but still the chicken should still be wrapped with lotus leaves and sheets of aluminum foil, and would be ready in less time than in an electric oven.

Stead declared that the new magazine would be for the general public, in distinction to the \\"select few\\" of the Society for Psychical Research As with the Review of Reviews, Stead was both proprietor and editor. He employed Ada Goodrich Freer as assistant editor: she was also a substantial contributor under the pseudonym \\"Miss X\\".Hall (1980) pp.45-52 Stead claimed that he was in the habit of communicating with Freer by telepathy and automatic writing. The magazine ceased publication in October 1897.

The Hadley Works were leased to the Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. Ltd. of Birmingham. In 1908 falling orders again forced a closure but most of the employees were offered jobs in the Birmingham area and the Hadley works were then sold in 1910 to Joseph Sankey and Company.

These areas in Karnataka, are altogether often referred to as Tulu Nadu. They are also found in small numbers in adjoining districts of Uttara Kannada, Shimoga and Kodagu. The Koraga are classified by the Government of India as a Scheduled Tribe. The Koraga, who numbered 16,071 according to the 2001 census of India, have their own language, classified as an independent Dravidian language, which is strongly influenced by Tulu, Kannada, Malayalam, languages commonly found in their area. Social status The 1901 census report noted the Koraga as being a lowly tribe of basket-makers and labourers, some of whom were employed as scavengers. They remain today among the untouchables, being considered as ritually polluted by Hindus, but there have in the past been claims that they are of Chandala stock. Their folklore claims Hubbashika to have been one of their chiefs but the Kadamba narrative asserts a Chandala origin, that they are the descendants of the offspring of a Brahman woman and a Shudra father. Edgar Thurston quotes M. T. Walhouse, who wrote in 1875 that this narrative was recorded by Brahmans and that, together with the Kapata, the Koraga were the lowest of the fifteen Chandala groups. However, Thurston thinks it probable that they were in fact the aboriginals of the region who were dispersed, dispossessed and turned into slaves by the influx of Aryans from the north of India. The area in which they live comprises mostly agricultural land and forest and the tribe continue to make use of the forest produce‚Äîprincipally, bamboo and creepers‚Äîfor the manufacture of baskets today. They traditionally lived in structures made of leaves, called koppus and also dressed in leaves. Around at the beginning of 21st century, they started to live in simple free houses constructed and sanctioned by Government agencies, but some of them are still either homeless or live on government-owned lands. Ajalu practice Koraga people have been subjected to a practice known as ajalu, which the Government of Karnataka defined as \\"differentiating Koraga people and persons belonging to other communities, treating them as inferior human beings, mixing hair, nails and other inedible abnoxious substances in the food and asking them to eat that food and to make them to run like buffaloes before the beginning of Kambala.\\" Ajalu has been considered to be inhuman and was prohibited in 2000 by the Karnataka Koragas (Prohibition of Ajalu Practice) Act,2000. Contravention of the Act is punishable by a term of imprisonment of between six months and five years, as well as a cash penalty. Nonetheless, ajalu has been occasionally witnessed during Nemotsava or temple fairs at places such as Inna (Karkala) and Saligrama, Udupi, leading to Koraga people demanding action against the culprits and the police who failed to prevent it. Religion Although an untouchable community, the Koraga regard themselves as Hindus, albeit ones who follow a tribal religious system. Despite being discriminated by other higher ranked groups, they exert a sense of superstitious fear because those groups consider the Koraga to be capable of influencing events through the use of magic and witchcraft. They worship spirits known as Bhutas as well as some devas and a sun god. Although once they practiced a form of matrilineal inheritance known as Aliya Santana, the Koraga may now be patrilineal (Makkala Santana). They practice endogamy with regard to their three main subdivisions, the Sappina, Ande and Kappada Koraga. Each of the three subdivisions are further divided into clans known as balis, and they do not marry within their own clan. Diet The diet of the Koraga is generally of poor quality in part because they spend between 40 and 50 per cent of their income on alcohol, which is consumed by all ages, and they also indulge in beedi and betel. They subsist mainly on rice and meats such as pork and beef, although they are increasingly also using produce such as pulses and vegetables. Their meat is often sourced from animals that have died naturally rather than by slaughter. Malnutrition is common among Koraga children due to poor diet and this is something of concern to the Government health authorities. Despite Government schemes designed to improve the nutritional content of their food, the implementation has been poor and Koraga people have sometimes demanded improvements to it. Drum beating Koraga people are known for drum beating (dollu or dolu beating) and it is one of their important cultural contributions. They used to beat dolu during events such as Kambala, village fairs or just for fun in their living places. Traditional belief was that Koraga drum-beating had special powers and that the sound of drum-beating drives away evil spirits. However, the practice declined as the drum beaters were looked down upon by society. Attempts are being made to revive the art by forming drum-beating troupes such as Gajamela in Dakshina Kannada, with support from the Government. Such troupes also give performances on occasions like tribal gatherings in coastal Karnataka. Flute music and dance involving both men and women are also important parts of Koraga culture and are apparent at celebrations such as Bhoomi Habba (worshipping earth). Education The Koraga people are an educationally disadvantaged tribe but progress is being made. The first PhD to be awarded to a member of the community was reported in 2010 and two other Koragas made headlines in 2012 when they passed the National Eligibility Test (NET) for lectureship conducted by the University Grants Commission. Government agencies are encouraging improvements in education for Koraga children by opening schools exclusively for their community in villages like Madhya Padavu. Support by Government agencies There have been lacklustre attempts, certainly since the 1980s, to alleviate the conditions of the tribe. A Tribal Sub-Plan instigated by the government of Karnataka failed to have any impact, at least in part because the affected tribes were not aware of its existence, and attempts by the Koragas themselves to exert pressure for change from around 1994 met with little success because their very organisation was sponsored by the government whom they were trying to hold to account. C. B. Damle has said that \\"They still live in the thatched huts in the outskirts of the village and depend on agricultural labour for their livelihood. Most of them are landless labourers though a few continue their traditional skill of basket making. In townships and in cities, they are engaged in scavenging and sweeping jobs.\\" Government authorities are helping the progress of Koraga people by activities such as granting cultivable lands, cross bred cows etc. Some of the Koraga colonies are developed with concrete lanes, tiled houses, electricity with financial support from District authorities, Taluk and village panchayats. Government authorities promised low cost concrete houses to all the 1126 Koraga families living in Dakshina Kannada. Residential summer camps are held exclusively for Koraga children by Government agencies, to impart non-curricular and vocational skills. Campaign for equality Koraga people have campaigned for equality in the 21st century with the support of organisations like the Koraga Abhivridhi Sanghagala Okkoota (Federation of Koraga Development Associations). Government measures such as those prohibiting ajalu and the affirmative action afforded by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. and the Bonded Labour System (Abolish) Act, 1976 are also significant. In places such as Kokkarne, Koraga people have stopped their practice of drum beating during Kambala fairs on the grounds that they were forced to keep a watch on slush paddy fields for the entire night. They have also complained of forced consumption of alcohol and smoking. See also *Jenu Kuruba *Soliga tribe References Further reading *.

History and profile Asian Scientist was launched in March 2011 by Asian Scientist Publishing Pte Ltd (now known as Wildtype Media Group Pte Ltd). Based in Singapore, Asian Scientist is maintained by a team of professional science and medical journalists, with active contributors from the science, technology and medical communities. The magazine's launch reflects the growing demographic of scientists, engineers and doctors from Asia, and caters to this community with news stories that are both timely and of interest to them. According to the 2010 U.S. National Science Foundation Key Science and Engineering Indicators report, one-quarter of the world‚Äôs publications are from Asia and one-third of all scientific researchers worldwide are Asian, representing a shift of the world's scientific center of gravity to Asia. According to the Science and Engineering Indicators 2012 released by the U.S. National Science Board, the largest global science and technology gains in recent years occurred in the \\"Asia-10‚Ä≥ ‚Äì China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. Between 1999 and 2009, for example, the U.S. share of global R&D; dropped from 38 to 31 percent, whereas Asia‚Äôs share grew from 24 to 35 percent during that period. On April 16, 2013, the company accepted seed funding from international science publisher World Scientific Publishing Company to expand operations at its Singapore headquarters. In January 2014, it launched its flagship print magazine targeted at scientists, healthcare professionals and students. The magazine's inaugural issue focused on the biomedical sciences and was featured by media outlets in Singapore and Malaysia as Asia's first science magazine. On April 2, 2015, it launched the inaugural Asian Scientist Writing Prize, co-organized with Science Centre Singapore and with prizes sponsored by World Scientific Publishing Company. The competition received close to 400 entries and gave out SGD$21,000 in cash and prizes. The competition returned for its second installment in 2017, this time with Dr. Jorge Cham of Piled Higher and Deeper as its invited guest speaker. In August 2015, it published a book called Singapore's Scientific Pioneers, with the goal of highlighting the contributions of 25 pioneering scientists from Singapore. The book was made possible by a Singapore50 Celebration Fund grant from the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to Dr. Juliana Chan and Dr. Rebecca Tan, who are both editors of the magazine. At the start of 2017, the company launched Supercomputing Asia, a new biannual print title dedicated to tracking the latest developments in high performance computing across the region and making supercomputing accessible to the layman. On May 4, 2018, the company was relaunched as Wildtype Media Group, a STEM-focused media company spanning digital, print, custom publishing and events. It works with academic and industry media partners in Asia on their communication strategies with key stakeholders and the public. Content The magazine covers science, medical and technology news updates from the Asia and Australasia regions. It devotes categories to research and development, health, medicine, new media and education. The site has been indexed by Google News since July 22, 2011. Notable coverage The magazine regularly features peer-reviewed basic and applied research from Asia, and carries out one-on-one interviews with notable Asian scientists. Prominent interviewees include: * Dr. K≈çsuke Morita of the RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, who discovered element 113 (nihonium), the first-ever element discovered in Asia to be added to the periodic table. Dr. Morita discussed the process and challenges that led up to this scientific achievement, and shared advice to young scientists in Asia. * Dr. Yongyuth Yuthavong, the deputy prime minister of Thailand. Dr. Yuthavong, who has a PhD in organic chemistry, shared his vision for science in Thailand and the ASEAN region, and the need for scientists to get involved in politics. * Ms. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, who is one of Forbes magazine‚Äôs 100 most powerful women in the world, and chairman and managing director of Biocon Limited, a billion-dollar Indian biotech company. Ms. Mazumdar-Shaw discussed the challenges to innovation and entrepreneurship that Asia faces. * 2012 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine, Dr. Shinya Yamanaka, who candidly discussed his early career, what inspires him, and the challenges he faced leading up to the 2012 Nobel Prize. * Former Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) Executive Director Dr. Wang Jun, who explained why the kung fu panda best describes the Chinese world leader in human, plant and animal genetics research. In 2016, Dr. Wang gave a second interview as co- founder of Chinese genomics biotech startup iCarbonX. * Dr. David Ho, CEO of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, who discussed HIV/AIDS research in China. Dr. Ho previously won the U.S. Presidential Citizen‚Äôs Medal and was TIME magazine's 1996 Person of the Year. * Dr. Zhang Feng, inventor of optogenetics and CRISPR gene editing, and youngest core member at the Broad Institute. * Dr. Sania Nishtar, founder of Pakistan NGO and think-tank, Heartfile, and also Pakistan‚Äôs first female cardiologist. * Dr. Shuji Nakamura, winner of the 2006 Millennium Technology Prize and co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing efficient blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs). * Dr. Dennis Lo, inventor of a non-invasive blood test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which detects cell-free placental DNA present in maternal blood. * Ms. Yeo Bee Yin, Malaysia‚Äôs Minister of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change, on her ministry's efforts to stem the deluge of plastic waste entering Malaysia. On March 30, 2016, Asian Scientist released the inaugural Asian Scientist 100 list. The Asian Scientist 100 list is an annual handpicked selection of 100 prize-winning Asian researchers, academicians, innovators and business leaders from across the Asia-Pacific region. This list of accomplished personalities included Tu Youyou, Kazutoshi Mori, K. Radhakrishnan and Nancy Ip. The list was subsequently mentioned by the Manila Bulletin, Philippine Daily Inquirer, GMA News Online, The Nation (Thailand), and VietNamNet Bridge. On May 22, 2019, the Philippine Senate adopted a resolution commending eight Filipino scientists on the Asian Scientist 100 list (2018 edition). The resolution was introduced by Senator Bam Aquino, chair of the Senate committee on science and technology, to congratulate the scientists for \\"bringing pride and prestige to the country\\".

He became known to larger audiences after publishing the bestselling campus novel Der Campus in 1995.  Life  Schwanitz's parents were teaching and living in the northern Ruhr area. In the late phase of World War II his mother send him with help of the Red Cross to Switzerland to escape the bombing raids in war torn Germany. In Switzerland Schwanitz stayed for six years with Mennonite mountain farmers rather isolated from society and without attending a school. He returned to his parents in 1950 and school director who took a liking in him (seeing him as a modern \\"Kaspar Hauser\\") got him accepted directly into a gymnasium (highschool) and helped him to catch up with the curriculum. Schwanitz graduated ultimately as best of his class and went on to pursue English studies, history and philosophy at universities in M√ºnster, London, Philadelphia and Freiburg. In 1971 he received his PhD from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg for thesis on George Bernard Shaw. In 1978 he became a tenured professor for English studies at the University of Hamburg where he stayed until his early retirement in 1997 due to health issues.

S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 17 May 2010 (publication date given on the newspaper's website, presumably correct date is late December 2004, German) After his retirement Schwanitz moved to Southern Germany. He continued to write and in 2001 he purchased the Salmen in Hartheim am Rhein, a restaurant with a theater stage. Schwanitz planned to turn it into a cultural center and had its theater room painted with Shakespearean motives. He was found dead in the Salmen in late December 2004. The police investigation concluded that there was no indication of a crime or suicide and that he had died of hypothermia. Originally it was reported that Schwanitz was suffering from Parkinson's disease but after his death it became known that in fact he had suffered from Huntington's disease instead. He was married, and the couple had one son and one daughter.Bettina Schulze: Gasthaus \\"Zum Salmen\\": Wie Shakespeare nach Hartheim kam. Badische Zeitung, 10 September 2011 (German)  Work  Schwanitz main academic work during his tenure at the University of Hamburg was applying system theory to literary theory and he published two books on that subject. First his main work Systemtheorie und Literatur. Ein neues Paradigma (\\"System Theory and Literature. A New Paradigm\\", 1990) which was later followed by Shakespeare und die Liebe. Ein Beispiel f√ºr die Applikation der Systemtheorie auf die Literatur. (\\"Shakespeare and Love. An Example for the Application of System Theory to Literature\\", 1996). He also published an introduction into English studies and a cultural history of the English speaking world. Schwanitz was popular with students as a teacher, in 1980 he had founded the University Players an English theater group that still existed long after he had left the university. The group garnered attraction in 1988 when it performed the play \\"MacBarsch\\" alluding to Uwe Barschel the leading figure in Waterkantgate, one West Germany's biggest political scandals.Maike Schiller: Professor, Autor, Uni-Kritiker. Hamburger Abendblatt, 23 December 2004 (German) In 1995 Schwanitz published Der Campus, which is a campus novel, a genre that didn't really exist in German at the time.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. History The city of Ironwood had plans to build a new municipal building since at least 1917. The building was intended to be a Memorial Building, housing municipal offices and serving as a memorial to veterans. In 1919, the city authorized the issuance of $400,000 in bonds to procure land for and construct the building. Ironwood's American Legion Post and the Ironwood Women's Club helped sell the bonds and raise a total of more than $500,000 to fund the building. It was designed by the Minneapolis firm of Bell & Kinports. The cornerstone of the building was laid in November 1922 in a ceremony honoring veterans of World War I. The building was completed in August 1923 It was used for municipal business, as well as social and recreational uses, such as banquets, plays, basketball games, and education. The Ironwood Memorial Building was remodeled in 1996. The building continues to serve as Ironwood's City Hall. Description Side view The Memorial Building is a two-story Neoclassical structure built of concrete in a pentagonal shape. The first floor is raised, providing light to the basement level. The two front facades are faced in grey terra cotta and coursed stone, while the remaining elevations are faced with brick. The heavy bronze door entrances are approached with wide granite steps and are flanked by Ionic columns. Above each entrance, clocks are inset into the terra cotta. A balustrade runs around the roof edge.

Born in Brandon, Manitoba, he started curling when he was fifteen. Thompson was President of the Kapuskasing Curling Club, a member of the Northern Ontario School committee and chairman of School Boys Curling Committee (now Junior curling). As a vice-president of the Canadian Curling Association he was involved in finding a new sponsor for the Brier and new formats for television coverage of curling events. As president of the Canadian Curling Association, Thompson took part in relocating its headquarters from Winnipeg to Ottawa and helped to establish scholarships for young curlers. Thompson was a life member of the Canadian Curling Association, a member of the Governor General‚Äôs Curling Club, a recipient of the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame‚Äôs Builder‚Äôs Award and recipient of a 1982 Ontario Special Achievement Award for \\"Major Contribution to Amateur Sport\\". As President of the International Curling Federation for three years, he was instrumental in increasing ladies‚Äô involvement, and in changing fee structure for television rights and future hosts of upcoming events. He presented to the World‚Äôs Olympic Organization and the 1988 Olympic committee to admit curling as a demonstration sport in the Calgary Olympics. Thompson moved to Stroud in 1979 and in 1980 along with Floyd Bean made a presentation to the Stroud Curling Club Board to request ice time for fourteen interested senior curlers. This number was not considered sufficient to warrant ice time but in April 1981, permission was given to create a league for senior curlers using the sheets of ice not needed by the Thursday Morning Ladies‚Äô League. In 1986 there were enough curlers, fifty-five years and older to fill three sheets of ice. Ten years later the draws were full and the committee was forced to adopt a two- draw format. The league used and continues to use the jitney format for forming teams. The league‚Äôs philosophy encouraged the recreational value of the sport of curling, and the development of curling skills while helping one another enjoy the game itself. The mini-spiel format was introduced, allowing players from both draws to compete in two four end games. Thompson promoted all aspect of curling; the skills, the rules, and the etiquette as well as the camaraderie. Thompson and his wife, Helen, operated a curling clinic to assist curlers of all levels become more confident in their abilities. Thompson was a club director for three years and acted as Honorary Chairman of the Masters and Colts Provincial Competition hosted by the Stroud Curling Club in 1995. In 1997 the Senior League at the Stroud Curling club officially became the ‚ÄòClif Thompson Senior Curlers‚Äô League.

Biography  Son of Alfredo Opisso y Vi√±as, journalist, historian and critic, and of Antonia Sala and Gil, his sister Regina Opisso, was also a writer. It comes from an illustrated family full of artists. His paternal grandfather was Josep Opisso y Roig, journalist and director of the Diari de Tarragona, father of the writers Antonia Opisso and Vi√±a and Antoni Opisso and Vi√±a. His maternal great-grandfather was the painter Pere Pau Monta√±a, his maternal grandfather the fabulist Felipe Jacinto Sala and his maternal uncle, the painter Emilio Sala y Franc√©s. His nephew was Arturo Llorens and Opisso, a writer best known under his pseudonym Arturo Llopis. Although he was born in Tarragona, his family moved to Barcelona when Opisso was only two years old. In the modernist Barcelona of the late nineteenth century, Opisso worked as an assistant to Antonio Gaud√≠ in the works of the Sagrada Familia in Barcelona since 1892. He was linked to the Els Quatre Gats group, together with Ram√≥n Casas, Manuel Hugu√©, Isidre Nonell and Pablo Picasso, among others. Later he worked as an illustrator in publications such as ¬°Cu-cut! (from 1903) and L'Esquella de la Torratxa (from 1912), signing drawings oriented to political satire, which are graphically related to art nouveau. Because of the dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera, Opisso abandons political satire and his drawings approach the theme of manners, specializing in popular scenes. His drawings of this era are characterized by presenting motley crowds in popular Barcelona scenes. From this time they date their best known works for the comic magazine TBO (in which he had begun to collaborate in 1919), where he specialized in the realization of covers. He collaborated with many other publications, such as En Patufet and Pocholo. In the postwar period, Opisso's pictorial work triumphed in the galleries of Barcelona. In 1953 he received recognition from his hometown at the IV Art Fair of Tarragona.  Opisso Museum  Astoria Hotel in Barcelona is shown continuously since late 2007 on the ground floor (lobby and cafeteria) a collection of more than 200 illustrations Opisso. The drawings and posters come from the private collection of Jordi Clos, president of the hotel chain owner (Derby Hotels Collection). ThIs excellent display of some of his work in the lobby of the Hotel Astoria is just off Avenida Diagnol in Barcelona.

He lived in Paris. Mirande exerted a great literary influence in the 1970s and 1980s, writing in Basque literary and cultural magazines as well as Breton ones. His contribution was an obvious thematic renewal. He wrote poetry and short stories in his youth, and essays and novels in his later years. Mirande was a nationalist and believed in the value of ethnicity, especially in the Basque language, but he was also pagan and laid claim to the values of paganism and of the ancient Basques. Mirande managed to incorporate Basque poetry into the modern European poetry landscape through an aestheticism of symbolist characteristics indebted to Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe. In his poetic works, Mirande covered topics never before dealt with by Basque poetry: prostitution, alcohol, pedophilic sex and so on.

Biography  The oldest child in a merchant family, J√©rica studied philosophy in the Dominican convent of his native city. While preparing to study law at the University of O√±ate, he completed a translation of Ovid's Heroides. In 1804 he printed his Humorous stories in different Castilian meters (Valencia, 1804) and moved to Cadiz to run the family business. There he created a dramatic translation of Picard's The puppets, or what can interest from the French (Cadiz, Quintana printing press, 1807), and learned Italian, English and Portuguese. He contributed to El Redactor General newspaper giving his opinions. He frequented the Caf√© de la Esperanza 'tertulia' and, between 1811 and 1813, he wrote for El Diario Mercantil under the initials P.J and C .; The few collaborations of 1813 derive from his trip to A Coru√±a, where he had some refugee friends like Valent√≠n de Foronda and Marcelino Calero, or intellectuals like Manuel Pardo de Andrade, coinciding with the writing of El Ciudadano por la Constituci√≥n. In his pages, as in the Cadiz journals, J√©rica opted for an ideological combat poetry that would change the traditional mentality of the people attacking servility and the Inquisition. In A Coru√±a, J√©rica became secretary of the Board of Censorship and Protection of the Freedom of Printing since November 1813. In early March of the following year he returned to his hometown and wrote for the Correo de Vitoria. The persecution of the liberals that undid the Manifesto of the Persians brought about a first trial for his activities in A Coru√±a, sentenced to exile in Melilla for ten years and one day. A second trial, initiated by the publication of some articles in the Correo de Vitoria, sentenced him to six years of imprisonment in Pamplona. Nevertheless, he could escape from both sentences by hiding in Deva and fleeing later to Dax (France); Also his Ensayos po√©ticos (Valencia, 1814), contained some stories that had published in 1804 and were prohibited by the Inquisition. The Kingdom of Spain sent out constant requests for return in 1814, considering hima state prisoner; The French police themselves claimed it in 1817, when he resided in Bayonne (France). He was imprisoned on several occasions and finally released in Pau. Returning to his native city when the Trienio Liberal (1820-1823) made it possible, he was commander of the Constitutional Volunteers, a member of the Censorship Board of the Provincial Council of √Ålava and finally, in 1823, constitutional mayor of Vitoria, which, after the invasion of the \\"Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\\" (1823) imposed a new arrest to him and exile to France. Becoming a naturalized Frenchman, he married Victoria de Caubotte, daughter of the Baroness of Castelnau, with whom he would have four children, and settled in Dax, where he remained to busy himself in writing: he published a Collection of stories, fables, descriptions, anecdotes, Selected dialogues (Bordeaux, 1831), culled from various Baroque comedies, as well as an instructive and entertaining Miscellany (Bordeaux, 1836) and Letrillas and Fables (Bordeaux, 1837) where he gathered the satirical work done in verse during his time as a journalist. J√©rica uses irony, satire and a great skill for the caricature, as well as costumbrismo art, not to entertain a reader who has no other requirement than to fill his leisure time, but to introduce his message of liberal revolution, hence his apparent inclination to festive literature.

Acevedo began working as a typographer's apprentice at the age of thirteen in Madrid, where he had moved with his family three years before. In 1898, he moved to Santander, where he became president of the Socialist Federation. Because he had a major role within the party, highlighted by his debate as a socialist representative against anarchist Emilio Carral, he was called upon by the socialists of Bilbao to be the editor of the newspaper La Lucha de Clases (Spanish: The Class Struggle). He was imprisoned several times because of his articles. In 1914, he returned to Asturias, where he edited La Aurora Social. He was arrested in 1917 for his participation in the revolutionary strike of that year. In 1921, as a delegate of the Asturian Socialist Federation, he participated in the Socialist Congress of Madrid. There, along with other supporters of the Third International, he founded the Communist Party of Spain. After founding the publication La Aurora Roja and traveling to Russia as a representative of Spain's Communist Party in the congresses of the Third National, he gave various lectures throughout Spain. These experiences led to his book Impresiones de un viaje a Rusia (Spanish: Impressions of a Trip to Russia), published in Oviedo in 1923. He also published a novel in 1930 called Los topos, in which he criticized Manuel Llaneza, a socialist mining leader. With the rise to power of Miguel Primo de Rivera, he was jailed for a few months and returned to Madrid. After the Spanish Civil War, he went into exile in Russia.

It was to be smaller and cheaper than the contemporary nuclear- powered . A single example was planned, but was not built, with further Nimitz-class carriers built instead. Development and design In the early 1970s, the United States Navy, following the doctrine of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo Zumwalt for larger numbers of smaller and cheaper ships, initiated design studies for a \\"minimum-cost\\" carrier of 50,000‚Äì60,000 tons. The new design was planned to be much cheaper than nuclear-powered carriers (a cost target of $550 million was set in 1972Friedman p324.) but still be suitable for replacing the ageing s.Friedman pp. 323‚Äì324.Naval Aviation News, July 1979, p. 8. Work on the project (designated T-CBL) was stopped however, when the US Congress made statements encouraging all major warships to be nuclear-powered, and in 1976 an order was placed for a fourth nuclear-powered . Later that year, however, US President Gerald Ford cancelled the order for the fourth Nimitz, stating that instead, two CVVs, medium-sized, conventional-powered carriers which were expected to mainly operate V/STOL aircraft would be built. The existing T-CBL design formed the basis for the new CVV, this being of the required size, while capable of operating all existing conventional carrier aircraft (this proved important as the hoped-for supersonic V/STOL fighters did not come to fruition). The CVV carried a smaller airgroup than existing supercarriers (i.e. about 60 compared with about 90 for the nuclear-powered Nimitz class or the conventional-powered s) and had two steam catapults rather than four, and three arrestor cables instead of four. The CVV also had a less powerful power plant, with steam turbines fed by six boilers generating in a two-shaft arrangement, compared with the delivered to four shafts of the larger carriers, giving a speed of compared with over .Naval Aviation News July 1979, pp. 11‚Äì12.Moore 1979, pp. 674, 675, 678. While slower than earlier carriers, this was still sufficiently fast to keep up with carrier task forces. Not all of the design features in the CVV were less capable than earlier carriers, however, as the carrier was planned to have improved protection for the ship's magazines and to be protected against under-keel explosions.Gardiner and Chumbley 1995, p. 575. The Carter administration from 1977 onwards continued with the CVV program, by now expected to cost $1.5 billion per ship compared to $2.4 billion for a Nimitz, vetoing congressional attempts to vote $2 billion towards construction of a fourth Nimitz, although plans for a second CVV were abandoned.Moore 1979, pp. 674‚Äì675. When it was realized that a repeat of , the last conventionally powered large carrier to be built would only cost about $100 million more than the CVV, while being much more capable, the Navy and the Secretary of Defense Harold Brown recommended that a repeat John F. Kennedy be included in the 1980 shipbuilding program instead of the CVV, but this was rejected by Carter, partly based on the lower life-cycle costs of the smaller ship with its smaller airwing.Naval Aviation News July 1979, p. 10.

In November 1871 the novel was released in book form. The novel's original text was severely edited by the magazine's staff. Background As the first chapters of this scathing political satire aimed at the Russian social democrats of the time started to appear in Russky Vestnik, allegations started to emerge among the Russian literary left, stating that it had been commissioned personally by its editor Mikhail Katkov. Repeated continuously by generations of Russian and Soviet critics, those were totally groundless, according to the modern literary historian Alla Shelayeva. Leskov's personal correspondence corroborates such view: he seems to have been utterly devastated by the way the magazine treated his text. In his October and November 1870 letters to Pyotr Schebalsky he complained about the whole chapters being thrown out, and asked this respected literary critic, close to the magazine to exert his personal influence over Katkov to protect him from these \\"tortures\\", calling one of the editors, Lyubimov, \\"the monster, Atilla, the killer of literature.\\"The 18 November 1870 letter. The Works by N.S. Leskov. Vol. 10. pp. 277‚Äì278. In the April 1871 letter to Schebalsky, Leskov confessed as to having finished the novel hastily, merely to fulfil his obligations.\\"Bukhstab, B. Foreword. The Works by N.S. Leskov in 6 volumes. Pravda Publishers, Moscow, 1973. Vol. 1. p—Ä. 3‚Äì42. There was a practical reason for this haste as well: in those days he was busy completing Grief And Laughter (1871) and The Cathedral Clergy (1866‚Äì1872). Later, in 1885 Leskov rated At Daggers Drawn as arguably the weakest of his novels.The Stockmarket Gazette. - 1885. 19 February 1885. When and why exactly Leskov decided to write the novel which proved to be so disastrous to his reputation, remained unknown. According to Andrey Nikolayevich, the author‚Äôs son and biographer, his father always refused to discuss the book which, in his own words, \\"crushed\\" him.The Life of Nikolai Leskov, 1984 // –õ–µ—Å–∫–æ–≤ –ê. –ñ–∏–∑–Ω—å –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –õ–µ—Å–∫–æ–≤–∞. - –ú.: –•—É–¥–æ–∂. –ª–∏—Ç., 1984. - –¢. 1. - –°. 258. Prototypes According to Andrey Leskov, in Alexandra Ivanovna Syntyanina the author portrayed his father's aunt Natalia Petrovna Strakhova, who was also forced to \\"enjoy the dubious privilege of being the wife of a madman from very early years.\\" The journalist and playwright Sergey Turbin, an eccentric man and an atheist thinker, served as a prototype for the Forov character. Another real-life man of letters, Vsevolod Krestovsky, might have been the prototype of the Vyslenyov character, at least he himself thought so (although Leskov denied this). Some critics noticed a curious detail. The relations between old man Bodrostin and Princess Vakhterminskaya in At Draggers Drawn are very similar to those between Schadursky and Baroness von Dering in Krestovsky's 1864 novel The Slums of Saint Petersburg. Reception Despite the negative response from the Russian literary left, At Daggers Drawn proved to be popular with the readership. \\"According to the Flying Library accounts, my novel is being read with avidness which exceeds all expectations,\\" Leskov remarked.The Works by N.S. Leskov. Vol. 10. - p. 291. Fyodor Dostoyevsky expressed his delight with the Evangel and Vanskok characters and praised Leskov for his masterful portraying of the small clergy.The Complete F.M. Dostoyevsky. Moscow, 1986. Vol. 29, p. 172. His general opinion of the novel, though, was low, and he dismissed it as \\"fanciful nonsense.\\" Maxim Gorky was also very fond of Anna Skokova (or Vanskok), a \\"funny-looking revolutionary girl,\\" and credited Leskov with being artful and realistic in depicting this particular character. On the whole, however, he condemned At Daggers Drawn as being \\"spiteful and full of vengeance\\".Gorky, A.M. N. S. Leskov. Miscellaneous articles. P. 87. In the 1930s Andrei Leskov complained about it in a letter to Gorky,Gorelov, –ê. The Son's Book About His father (–ö–Ω–∏–≥–∞ —Å—ã–Ω–∞ –æ–± –æ—Ç—Ü–µ) // Leskov, –ê.

The novel has been panned as tendentious, reactionary and occasionally even anti-Semitic, on the basis of there being a minor character named Tikhon Kushevsky, who was both a Jew and a cynical crook.The History of the Russian Literature. Leningrad. Nauka Publishers. 1982, Vol. 3. p. 285. It was not included into the 11-volume Khudozhestvennaya Literatura collection. In the late 1950s, critic B.M. Drugov in his comprehensive study of Leskov legacy alleged that the novel had been concocted from \\"the receipts written by Katkov\\"Drugov, B.M. N.S. Leskov. The Overview. Moscow, 1957. p. 46. and quoted Ieronim Yasinsky: \\"When for the first time I entered the circle of Vasily Stepanovich Kurochkin in 1870‚Ä¶ people spoke of [Leskov] with disdain, as of a Third Section man,\\" the accusation which the modern scholar Alla Shelayeva called \\"slanderous\\". Boris Bukhstab in his preface for the 1973 six-volume Leskov collection, described the novel as \\"bad\\" and \\"weak\\", with \\"every character being a blackmailer, a thief or a murderer.\\" The first attempt at reviewing At Daggers Drawn objectively in the USSR came in 1978 when Irina Stolyarova in her essay \\"Searching for an Ideal\\" suggested that the novel should be regarded as not so much an attack on the social democrats of its time, as a 'research', motivated by its author's \\"desire to respond quickly to the hot issues, cast the newly emerging character types, reveal new mindsets and new relations that were starting to take shape in the Russian life of the time.\\"Stolyarova, I.V. Looking for an Ideal. The Works by N.S. Leskov. Leningrad, 1978. p. 48. Later Alla Shelayeva, while admitting the novel was a scathing satire, opined that its aim had been not all 'nihilists', but only what the author regarded as \\"the foam of the movement.\\" This view is corroborated by Nikolai Leskov's letter to Alexey Suvorin, in which he wrote: \\"I do not imply that crookedness 'comes directly from nihilism,' there is no such idea in my novel... I am convinced that crookedness had leached upon nihilism exactly in the same way it's been leeching upon idealism, theology or patriotism...\\"The Works by N.S. Leskov. Vol. 10. pp. 297‚Äì298.

He was shot and killed by security forces during a protest in downtown C√≥rdoba in September 1966. Student Strike On the night of 7 September 1966, thousands of students responded to the call for a strike, including Santiago Pampill√≥n. The police were ordered to prevent and suppress the protest and a battle ensued, spanning more than twenty blocks from downtown. Amid the struggle, Pampill√≥n received three shots to the head, fired at close range by a policeman. He was taken to a hospital, where he died on 12 September. In solidarity with the student movement, the CGT of C√≥rdoba organized a silent march that was later repressed by the police. Implications Santiago Pampill√≥n was the first casualty in a long series of murders that occurred during the course of the military regime (1966-1973), among others such as Juan Jos√© Cabral, Adolfo Bello, Luis Norberto White and Silvia Filler. His death anticipated an escalation of violence that eventually led to full- fledged state terrorism in Argentina. Since then, the Argentine student movement has vindicated his name as a symbol of university activism and worker-student unity.

Biographie par Jean Fr√©d√©ric Brun He completed his studies in pharmacy, philology and history. He graduated from m√©ridional and history studies. He dedicated his career to the restoration and normalization of the modern Occitan language. He was secretary general of the Societat d'Estudis Occitans, created in Toulouse in 1930, and followed the methods of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans. In 1935, the Office of Southern Relations of the Generalitat of Catalonia published in Barcelona his work , dedicated exclusively to the speakers of Languedoc, which served as the base for the purification of the rest of the Occitan dialects. He also worked toward the creation of a common literary language, a goal partially reached after the Second World War by the new Institut d'Estudis Occitans, successor to the Societat. In his later years he recompiled materials for an Occitan dictionary, destined to end with the fragmentation of the literary language and the Frankification of the vocabulary, orthography, and syntax.

Following elections to the state legislative assembly, the governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the state government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly.

Work  \\"When characterizing the works of the prominent Slovak painter Adam Szentp√©tery (born in 1956), from the very start it is necessary to emphasize that we shall communicate in the visual language of geometry with strong painting coding. Over the course of the 1980s, geometry became the matrix of his works onto which he places individual art outputs and links. The line, color, and surface are the primary building blocks of his picture system. Although in the course of decades Szentp√©tery has built a key monolithic painting programme in the field of geometric abstraction forming a unique contribution to the contemporary language of painting in Slovakia, it still remains a solitary phenomenon in the home environment.\\" Vladim√≠r Beskid,2010 * Richard Adam, Beskid, V.: Adam Szentp√©tery, published by Wannieck Gallery, 2010,  Exhibitions  Since 1984 until now Szentp√©tery exhibited his works in numerous solo (21) and group exhibitions (142) around the world, mostly in the countries of the European Union, but his paintings also got exhibited as far as Japan, Korea or Taiwan.

Her field of expertise was the ethnography, culture, folklore and language of the people of East Polynesia. Feodorova was doctor of historical sciences and a leading scientist of the Department of Australia, Oceania and Indonesia at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Russian Academy of Science) at the Kunstkamera, St. Petersberg, the first Russian museum that was named after Peter the Great. In 1981, Feodorova was given the honour of being named N. N. Miklouho-Maclay Laureate of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science.Recognized by Russian Academy of Science: Premium of Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science (1995). Family and personal life Feodorova was born in Leningrad in 1931. Her father, Konstantin Andreevich Mozhajsky, worked in a printing house. Her mother, Lydia Romanovna Steinberg taught German at schools in Leningrad. Feodorova and her husband, Mikhail Lvovich Fedorov, had one daughter, Olga Fedorova. Education and early career In 1964, Fedorova participated in the \\"VII International Congress of Archeology and Ethnography\\" in Moscow. In 1966, she completed her Master's degree with a thesis entitled, \\"Folklore of Easter island as a historical source\\". Scientific contributions Myths, legends of Easter Island In 1978, Feodorova published her first monograph, \\"Myths and legends of Easter Island\\".Myths, legends of Easter Island. 1978. Translation: Husvet-szigeti mitoszok‚Ä¶ Budapest, 1987 It is a seminal study of the relics of Rapanui folklore. This publication earned Feodorova the honour of being named the \\"N. N. Miklouho- Macklay Laureate\\" of the \\"Presidium of the Russian Academy of Science\\" in 1981. In 1987, her work was translated into Hungarian and republished in Budapest. The book includes Feodorova's translations of the Easter Island legends recorded in the 1956 manuscripts of the Norwegian researcher Thor Heyerdahl. Heyerdahl approached the Kunstkamera to help with the translation of the Rapanui language because of the institution's reputation in decipherment. He published the Feodorova translations in his \\"Works of the Norwegian archeological expedition\\" (Vol 2, 1965). Myths and Legends of Easter Island Feodorova continued to study Rapanui culture and in 1988 published her second monograph on the subject.Myths and Legends of Easter Island (1988) This work includes a basic dictionary of Rapanui language (direct and reverse). It also includes a translation of the 1974 publication of Rapanui text by the German researcher, Thomas Barthel. Easter Island. Sketches of culture of the 19th and 20th centuries In 1994, Feodorova gained her Doctorate with the book, Easter island. Sketches of the culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesEaster island. Sketches of the culture of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1993). The book examines the history of the population of Easter Island; the ethnogenesis of its inhabitants; and theories about the original ancient civilisation. Feodorova analysed the culture of the indigenous people of Rapanui including their folklore, language, chanting connected with string games, features of a tattoo and the stone statues. She examined the meaning of funeral braids and carved wooden figures. Kohau Rongorongo tablets from Kunstkamera In 1995, Feodorova published a third monograph. It contained her attempt at deciphering the two rongorongo tablets in the Kunstkamera. This work earned Feodorova the Premium of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.\\"Kohau Rongorongo tablets from Kunstkamera\\" (1995) The monograph presents the full texts and Feodorova's translations of two Rapanui plates from the Kunstkamera collection. Peer review of Kohau Rongorongo script research Feodorova's studies of the Kohau RongoRongo script date from the 1960s. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single logographic reading.Fedorova 1995 However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, the Mamari calendar, the single rongorongo text that can be read, contains no calendrical information in Feodorova's decipherment, but reads instead like the following sample: :a root, a root, a root, a root, a root, a root [that is, a lot of roots], a tuber, he took, he cut a potato tuber, he dug up yam shoots, a yam tuber, a potato tuber, a tuber, which even Fedorova characterized as \\"worthy of a maniac\\".Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov 2007:10 What Feodorova translates as \\"root\\", the small community of rongorongo specialists agree is instead a calendrical night. Konstantin Pozdniakov concluded that Feodorova's translations \\"are not accompanied by the least justification\\". Speaking Tablets From Easter Island In 2001, Feodorova published her attempts at decoding, reading, and translating all the examples of ancient Rapanui text from museums around the world.\\"Speaking tablets from Easter island. Decoding, reading, translation (2001)\\" This work includes the \\"Tomenika Tau a Ure\\" tablet recorded in the manuscript of Francis Mazier. Missionaries of Easter Island Feodorova's fifth book, Missionaries of Easter Island (2004) is devoted to the history of the first Catholic Rapanui mission and the relationship of the missionaries to original Rapanui culture. It uses rare archival materials and publications of the Catholic mission, the \\"Congregation de Sacres Coeurs\\" (Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary). Feodorova demonstrates the positive role the missionaries played in Rapanui in the 19th century in the study and preservation of the indigenous population and their culture.Missionaries of Easter Island (2004) Other work =Articles= Feodorova has contributed many articles to the international scientific community. Her focus is the ethnography, culture, folklore and language of the inhabitants of Easter Island. She has also written about the inhabitants of other islands of Polynesia such as Hawaii, New Zealand, Marquises, Mangarewa, Tahiti, Samoa and Tonga. Feodorova's other studies concern the origin of people of Oceania; Pacific oceanic contacts; the role of the Areoi (a society of secret warriors) in Polynesia; the linguistics of Polynesian and American Indian languages. She has also researched petroglyphs, zodiac signs, ancient calendars, paleoastronomy, toponyms, terms of relationship and social systems, material culture, mythology, religious views, magic fairy tales, games, tattoos and the meanings of Polynesian sculptural and carved images. =The way of the ancestors= From 1995, Feodorova was a member of the informal cultural group \\"The way of the ancestors\\". The group researched and published the history and the work of the first Russian round-the-world expedition (1803‚àí1806). As part of the Russian world expedition, A. J. Krusenstern in the \\"Nadeshda\\" and J. F. Lisjansky in the \\"Neva\\" sailed to the islands of East Polynesia, including Easter Island, Marquesas and Hawaii.Atlas k PuteshestviiÔ∏†uÔ∏° vokrug sviÔ∏†eÔ∏°ta Kapitana Kruzenshtern, Kruzenshtern, Ivan Fedorovich, 1770-1846.

In 2001, the memorial edition, \\" The Russian Geographical Society: 165 years of service to Fatherland\\". Feodorova studied the diaries and letters of I. K. Horner, F. I. Shemelin, M. I.

The cancer drug trabectedin is isolated from E. turbinata. Description Ecteinascidia turbinata is a colonial sea squirt. The individual zooids can grow to a height of and are shaped like wide-necked bottles. They are connected by a stolon at the base through which blood circulates between the zooids and which serves to attach the colony to the substrate. The walls of the zooids are known as tunics and are strengthened with cellulose, which is unusual for an animal. They are connected to the outside water by siphons. The walls of the tunic are translucent and the pharyngeal basket can be seen through them. The siphon margins are orange because of the deposition of carotenoids there. This is a warning colour, for E. turbinata is distasteful, and deters predators. Colonies can reach a width of .Ecteinascidia turbinata - Mangrove tunicate Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Retrieved 2012-04-06. Distribution and habitat Ecteinascidia turbinata is found all the year round in shallow waters in the Caribbean Sea, the east coast of Florida, Bermuda and the Gulf of Mexico. In the summer it is occasionally found in Chesapeake Bay, off the coasts of North and South Carolina and in the Mediterranean Sea. It primarily grows on the submerged roots of mangroves (Rhizophora mangle). In Cuba, where it is abundant, it has been found at densities of one colony per metre of mangrove root. It is also found growing on rocks, jetties, the black coral (Antipathes caribbeana), floating debris and among seagrasses. Biology Ecteinascidia turbinata is a filter feeder. Each zooid draws water into its interior through the inhalant siphon at the top and expels it through the exhalant siphon. Food particles, mostly plankton, get trapped in mucus as the water passes through a mesh-like pharyngeal basket. From here the particles are moved by cilia to the U-shaped gut. Undigested remains get expelled through the anus near the exhalent siphon where they get carried away by the water current. The colony can grow by budding, a form of asexual reproduction, new zooids growing from the stolon. In spring and early summer, sexual reproduction takes place. Ecteinascidia turbinata is a simultaneous hermaphrodite with eggs and sperm being produced by each individual. After fertilisation, the eggs are brooded in the body cavity for about a week. They then develop into bright yellow, tadpole-like larvae with a distinct notochord which pass out into the water column. They can swim and have a yolk on which they feed for several days. When this is exhausted they need to find a suitable place to settle and metamorphosize into a juvenile sea squirt, ready to start a new colony. Ecology Vanadium is accumulated in the tunic of Ecteinascidia turbinata where it may have a concentration one million times higher than that of the surrounding sea water. Its function is uncertain but, along with certain secondary metabolites, it renders the tunicate distasteful to predators, and the associated bright orange colouring advertises this. The flatworm Maritigrella crozierae is the main predator and seems immune to the anti-predator agents. It crawls over the surface of the colony and everts its pharynx into individual zooids, sucking out the tissues. Other fouling organisms living in the vicinity of Ecteinascidia turbinata include sponges and other tunicates. Several species of amphipod live symbiotically inside the zooids. One of the secondary metabolites produced by Ecteinascidia turbinata is an alkaloid, Ecteinascidin 743, also known as trabectedin, which has been found to have anti-tumour properties. It is undergoing clinical trials and is already in use in Europe under the trade name \\"Yondelis\\" for treatment of certain soft tissue sarcomas and recurrent ovarian cancer.ECTEINASCIDIN 743 (Yondelis, ET-743) MarineBiotech.org.

Biography  Pedro Mal√≥n de Chaide was born in Cascante, Navarra c. 1530. His father and brother were notaries in Cascante. He went to Salamanca to study letters, but entered the convent of Augustinians of Cascante and afterwards professed solemn vows on October 27, 1557. In university he was a disciple of Fray Luis de Leon and Fr. Juan de Guevara, which influenced him deeply. He later lived in Burgos from 1569 to 1572 when, in 1572, the Inquisition took hold of the Augustinian biblical scholar Alonso Gudiel, professor at the University of Osuna, in Valladolid. He designed a thesis in Latin to support the Incarnation of Christ in the chapter that the Augustinian province of Castile celebrated there, although Mal√≥n declared that he had composed them. The Inquisition, which had received the accusations against him and Gaspar de Grajal of the Hellenist Leon de Castro, an enemy not only of Friar Luis de Leon but of all his friends, considered them heretical; Gudiel died in prison a few months later without clarifying the matter, which impressed strongly to Mal√≥n de Echaide, in view of the difficulties that had also suffered his master fray Luis, and is attributed to this incident the reluctance to publish his works , of which two were unpublished, and the fact that it passed by order of its superiors from the province of Castile to the one of Aragon to prevent future evils. He was, therefore, in the convent of Saragossa, where he was prior (1575-1577), and in Huesca (1578-1583), also of prior; In this stay, he began to compose his works. At the University of Huesca he got his doctorate in Theology in 1581. In 1582 he was appointed teacher of the Augustinian Order and in 1583, being the definitor of the province, he was appointed professor in Zaragoza; There he treated the great humanist manchego Pedro Sim√≥n Abril. He took part in the foundation of the monastery of Our Lady of Loreto, in Huesca, in 1585. He was prior of the convent of Barcelona; In 1588 he published his only printed book, The Conversion of the Magdalene.

Nathdwara paintings are of different sub-styles of which Pichhwai paintings are the most popular. The word Pichwai derives from the Sanskrit words pich meaning back and wais meaning hanging. These paintings are cloth paintings hung behind the image of the Hindu god Shrinathji. Origin and area The Nathdwara school is a subset of the Mewar school of painting and is seen as an important school in the 17th and 18th century miniature paintings. The sub-styles of Mewar painting include Udaigarh, Devgarh and Nathdwara as important centers of miniature production. The temple of Shrinathji is believed to have provided a boost to the art activities in the town. It is recorded that to avoid the oppression of the iconoclast Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, the image of Shrinathji, a child manifestation of Krishna was installed in Nathdwara in 1670 by Goswami priests from Mathura. After this, many artists, including the famous Acharya Gopinathji, motivated by religious fervor came and created paintings of Srinathji. Pichhwai are intricate paintings which portray Lord Krishna. They exist in the holy town of Nathdwara in the Rajasthan state of India. Krishna is shown in different moods, body postures, and attire more commonly found on a cloth or paper. It is a very ancient form of art passed on from generation to generation and it has a very devotional theme towards Lord Krishna. The purpose of Pichhwais, other than its artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. They have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors in the area. These artists mostly live in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and make a close community with constant interaction. It is no wonder that many times a Pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skillful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist. Themes Srinathji. Most works produced in this style revolve around the figure of Shrinathji as a manifestation of Krishna and refer to the incident of him holding the Govardhan hill on his last finger. Each pichwai painting is considered a seva or an offering to the deity and hence personifies Shrinathji as a prince with jewels and luxuries, surrounded by the milkmaids, gopis. These seva themes are based on different seasons and paintings are made to depict different moods of the season. There are also paintings that show the Lord in different costumes celebrating different festivals. Other themes like Mata Yashoda, Nandlal and Balgopal figures are also painted in this style. Some of the paintings are gem-encrusted.

He published many influential works on Delaware, Shawnee, Hopi and the T√ºbatulabal languages.  Career  Born in New York, he entered Stanford University and received a BA in Psychology, after which he traveled to New Zealand to study Maori music. Then he decided to study anthropology at University of California, Berkeley where he was trained by Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie and Melville Jacobs, writing his dissertation as a grammar of T√ºbatulabal. At first he had great difficulties hearing the phonetic distinctions of the language, but in 1931 he went to the field with Danish linguist Hans J√∏rgen Uldall who taught him to recognize all the phonetic contrasts. His proficiency in Indigenous languages became so good that he was able to correspond with Leonard Bloomfield in Ojibwe, letters later published in the journal Anthropological linguistics.Charles F.

He was the son of the journalist Charles \\"Ernest\\" Amillet (1829‚Äì1904) and the milliner Caroline Reboux. He later took his mother's maiden name with \\"Paul\\" as a nom de plume, and is usually known as Paul Reboux. Life A painter as well as prolific writer, his literary career was diverse, as editor, literary critic, food critic, novelist, and author of natural history books, biographies, travel stories and children's books. √Ä la mani√®re de ... Reboux's first publications were pastiches with his friend Charles M√ºller. Together they published three series of √Ä la mani√®re de ... (In the manner of ...) (1908, 1910 and 1913). M√ºller died in 1914, and Reboux published a fourth collection in 1925 and a fifth in 1950 on his own, in which his pastiches of Jean-Paul Sartre neighbour with those of Jean Giono, Boris Vian and Henry de Montherlant. These collections gently mock the literary tics of writers such as Octave Mirbeau, Leo Tolstoy, Marcel Proust, Stephane Mallarm√©, Gyp, Alphonse Daudet, Jos√© Maria de Heredia, Jules Renard, Jean Jaur√®s, Charles Peguy, Arthur Conan Doyle, Anna de Noailles, and others. They have been reissued until today (the last edition dates from 2003), but some authors considered very obscure today (notably, Gyp) have been eliminated from these reissues. In the preface to √Ä la mani√®re de ..., in fact writing in the style of the chronicler Georges-Armand Masson, Reboux describes at length the golden rules that preside over the good drafting of a pastiche. This process was also taken up by Jean-Louis Curtis in several of his books, such as Haute √âcole, China Worries Me, and France Exhausts Me. The Irish-American, Paris-resident composer Swan Hennessy (1866‚Äì1929) wrote five volumes of √Ä la mani√®re de ... with music for piano (published 1927‚Äì8), which was inspired by the Reboux/M√ºller series. In these he parodies the styles of a number of historical and contemporary composers. Other activities Between 1922 and 1924, Paul Reboux edited an illustrated humour magazine, La Charrette charrie. In 1951, along with F√©licien Challaye and √âmile Bauchet, he was one of the founders of \\"La Voie de la paix\\", organ of the Comit√© national de resistance √† la guerre et √† l'oppression (CNRGO; the national committee of resistance to war and oppression, which became the pacifist union of France in 1961).

Hern√°ndez was a self-taught novelist, playwright and writer whose works include theater, novels, short stories, literary and journalistic chronicles, essays, poetry and popular Chilean folklore. He created over 840 works, including the plays Almas perdidas, El Vino triste, La Sangre, and El Rancho. He was awarded the Premio Nacional de Teatro in 1936. His work, along with that of authors like Germ√°n Luco Cruchaga and Armando Moock, marked the beginnings of Chilean dramaturgy. Biography Hern√°ndez was the son of Juan Acevedo Astorga (one of the soldiers of the War of the Pacific) and Maria Hern√°ndez Urbistondo. After having spent his early years in Tracacura, he moved to Temuco. When he was a little over 10 years, he went into the woods in the area, where loggers taught him mastery of weapons. He was illiterate until he moved to the city of Chill√°n, where he entered the Escuela Taller, studying the art of carpentry. However, his precarious economic situation forced him to work carrying out multiple trades (woodcutter, charger, vendor fairs and carpenter). He stayed in school for a year and learned to read and write. Career At sixteen years old Hern√°ndez decided to move to Santiago. To achieve this, he walked four days without eating until reaching Linares, where an acquaintance of his father gave him a passage to the capital. At that time, in Santiago the 900 literary generation flourished, which involved important Chilean literary figures such as: Pedro Antonio Gonz√°lez, Carlos Pezoa Veliz, Fernando Santiv√°n, Pedro Prado and Juan D'Halmar. However, Hern√°ndez did not become linked so much with this generation as with the movement driven by Luis Emilio Recabarren. As a result of the commitment he made with this social movement, in 1903 he participated in the port strike in Valpara√≠so, then, in a railway strike in Caleta Abarca, and another in 1905, in the capital. It was within these movements that he met, in 1913, Domingo G√≥mez Rojas, who read his work and was excited to present it in theaters. This would be the initial step in a progressive massification of his dramaturgy. While writing and offering his works to theaters, he had to continue working as a clerk in stores, at the Civil Registry and even doing some boxing matches. However, he was afterwards hired by the Pellicer theater company to sweep dressing rooms, run errands for artists, to be a prompter, vigilante, \\"text arranger\\", or whatever was needed. From then on, every year his productions increased, as well as the advancement of the Chilean theater in the country. Death His difficult years and arteriosclerosis caused him to gradually lose his mental faculties until his death. > Sus funerales fueron grandiosos. Lo √∫nico grandioso que tuvo en su vida. > Masas de gentes se apostaron en las calles y arrojaron flores al paso del > f√©retro. Despidieron sus restos en el Campo Santo representantes de todas > las condiciones pol√≠ticas y ramas sociales, recibiendo as√≠ su cuerpo sin > vida los honores de los m√°s grandes, de aquellos que muchas veces quisieron > negarle el derecho a la vida. > His funeral was grandiose. The only grandeur that there was in his life. > Masses of people were stationed on the streets and threw flowers as his > coffin passed. Representatives of all the political and social branches bid > goodbye to his remains in the Campo Santo, thereby his lifeless body > received the greatest honors, of those who often wanted to deny him the > right to life. Work Hern√°ndez's work sought, first, to abandon the frequent imitation of theater performances that were in vogue at the time (operettas and light comedies, among others), so his background was often autobiographical. His proletarian reality formed the cornerstone of each of his creations. Therefore, most of his works speak about exploitation, marginalization, alcoholism, violence, and social problems of farmers, miners, laborers and manufacturers. His texts were influenced by both the folklore and popular religion, as well as by his own, often intuitive, reading of texts, ranging from the classics, to productions framed in ideological currents of socialism and anarchism. Acevedo Hern√°ndez ventured into this kind of socially engaged theater before the publication of El teatro pol√≠tico (The political theater) by Erwin Piscator in 1929 and El peque√±o Organ√≥n (Little Organon) by Bertolt Brecht in 1948. The police force intervened in performances of his works repeatedly, either by censorship or because they caused unrest within the theater; on one occasion, during the premiere of Los deportados (The deportees) in 1931, someone from the audience shot an actor who was portraying a cop.

Life Born on 13 February 1743 at Roystone, near Barnsley in Yorkshire, he was the son of George Wood (1704‚Äì1781), vicar of Roystone, by his wife Jane, daughter of John Matson of Roystone. He was intended for a career as a solicitor, and was articled to an attorney at Cawthorn named West. At the end of his articles West urged him to study for the bar. Entering the Middle Temple, Wood began as a special pleader and established a reputation. He many pupils, among whom were Edward Law, Thomas Erskine, Charles Abbott, James Scarlett, and John Williams. Immediately on being called to the bar he was engaged by the Crown for all the state prosecutions beginning in December 1792. He joined the northern circuit, and on 5 November 1796 he was returned to parliament for Haslemere in Surrey, retaining his seat until 1806. In April 1807 Wood was appointed a baron of the exchequer and was knighted; as a judge he was painstaking. He was a supporter of prerogative power and took a strong stand against free criticism of the executive by the press; Henry Brougham threatened to move his impeachment. Wood resigned his office in February 1823, and died on 7 July 1824 at his house in Bedford Square. He was buried in the Temple church. By his wife Sarah he left no issue.

Life and career Zusmanas Gurvicius was born on January 5, 1927 in Yatsmev, Lithuania to Jacob Gurvich and Jaie Galperas, Lithuanian Jews. In 1931 his father Jacob, seeking freedom from religious persecution and a better future for his family, emigrated to Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1932 Jacob sent for his wife and two children. Once they arrived they moved into Barrio Sur, a neighborhood consisting mainly of European immigrants. His father began working as a barber, and later opened many barbershops of his own throughout the city. He was enrolled in elementary school under the name of Jos√© Gurvich, as school officials could not understand why his father's surname was Gurvich and his Gurvicius. From the beginning he displayed a love for the arts, constantly drawing for his sister and her friends. Upon finishing elementary school he started working in a factory. In 1942 he began studying painting at the National School of Fine Arts in Montevideo under the tutoring of Jos√© C√∫neo. The following year he took up music and violin with professor Julber. He met Horacio Torres, who was also studying violin, and it was then that his life took a decisive turn. In 1944, Julber got him an interview with the famous painter, Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a. From then on his true calling was defined. His world of shapes and colors was complete. He joined the controversial studio created by Torres Garc√≠a, where he worked until the Studio closed. In subsequent years, his work was exhibited throughout Uruguay and published in \\"Removedor\\", one of the most important publications promoting art in Latin America. After the death of Torres Garc√≠a, he travelled extensively through Europe and Israel. While in Israel he stayed at the Ramot Menashe kibbutz, where his sister Myriam and his parents lived. In the kibbutz he worked as a shepherd and was asked to paint a mural for the public dining room. It was there that he came to grips with his Jewish ancestry and took part in what was the birth of the Jewish State. Living at the kibbutz he painted the world and the reality which surrounded him; Israeli pastoral and religious traditions and Yiddish folklore. In 1956 he held the first of three exhibitions at the Katz Gallery in Tel Aviv. In Spain he continued his work inspired by the Spanish masters, Goya and Vel√°zquez; but it was the work of El Bosco and Pieter Brueghel that fueled his thirst for diversity and learned to transform his wealth of images into his own unique vision. He moved to New York City in 1970 with his wife and son. In New York all these diverse environments that had shaped him, from his native Montevideo, to his Jewish roots, and now the vibrant sounds of New York, helped him define his unique artistic talent which seemed to effortlessly bridge cultures and distances. He died in New York at the young age of 47 and at the height of his career. Museo Gurvich in Montevideo, Uruguay has an extensive collection of his art.http://www.museogurvich.org References 1927 births 1974 deaths Jewish painters Lithuanian emigrants to Uruguay Lithuanian Jews Uruguayan Jews Uruguayan people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent 20th-century Lithuanian painters 20th-century Uruguayan painters Male painters 20th- century male artists ","title":"Jos√© Gurvich"},{"id":"34226643","text":"Rarobacteraceae is a monotypic Actinomycete family.

Because of this, Auad came into contact with the Relatives of Those Disappeared and Detained for Political Reasons (Familiares de Desaparecidos y Detenidos por Razones Pol√≠ticas) and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who were seeking to find their children.  Disappearance  Between Thursday, December 8 and Saturday, December 10, 1977, a group of soldiers under the command of Alfredo Astiz kidnapped a group of twelve people linked to the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo.1 Among them was Angela Auad, together with the founding mothers of Mothers of Plaza de Mayo Azucena Villaflor, Esther Ballestrino and Mar√≠a Ponce, and the French nuns Alice Domon and L√©onie Duquet. √Ångela was kidnapped on December 8 with most of the group in the Santa Cruz Church, located in the San Crist√≥bal neighborhood of the city of Buenos Aires, where they used to meet. She was taken directly to the clandestine detention center located in the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics (Escuela Superior de Mec√°nica de la Armada, ESMA), under the control of the Argentine Navy, where she was held in the area called \\"Capucha\\". She remained there for approximately ten days, during which time she was constantly tortured. In the Report Never Again the witnesses Maggio and Cubas, survivors of the ESMA (Note 1), reported what they knew about their fate: > The same happened with the French religious Alice Domon and Leonie Ren√©e > Duquet.

Some were buried in mass graves at General Lavalle Cemetery about 400 kilometers south of the capital. It was later confirmed that the military threw prisoners from planes and helicopters to kill them after torture. In July 2005, a mass grave with remains of several women was exhumed. Forensic DNA testing established the identities of Auad and other women kidnapped with her, including Duquet and Villaflor. Auad was buried in the garden of Santa Cruz Church alongside L√©onie Duquet, Esther Ballestrino de Careaga, and Mar√≠a Ponce de Bianca. Identification of her body and burial On December 20, 1977 corpses from the sea began to appear on the beaches of the province of Buenos Aires at the height of the spas of Santa Teresita and Mar del Tuy√∫. The police doctors who examined the bodies at that time recorded that the cause of death had been \\"the clash against hard objects from high altitude,\\" as indicated by the type of bone fractures observed, which occurred before death. the local authorities immediately arranged for the bodies to be buried as NN in the cemetery of the nearby city of General Lavalle. In 1984, in the framework of the investigation of the CONADEP and the Trial to the Boards, excavations had been carried out in the General Lavalle cemetery, finding a large quantity of skeletal remains from the corpses found on the beaches of San Bernardo and Lucila del Mar. These remains were used in the trial of the Boards and then stored in 16 bags. From then on Judge Horacio Cattani began to accumulate causes about disappeared. Despite the laws of Full Stop and Due Obedience, which paralyzed the investigation, Cattani managed to arm in 1995 a file of 40 square meters to house all these tests. In 2003, the mayor of General Lavalle reported that new NN tombs had been located in the cemetery of the city. The judge then ordered Cattani make new excavations with Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), being discovered two lines of tombs, one above the other. 8 skeletons were discovered, 5 corresponding to women, corresponding to men and one, classified as GL-17, which was defined as \\"probably male\\". Cattani sent the bones to the Laboratory of Immunogenetics and Molecular Diagnostics (LIDMO) of C√≥rdoba, belonging to the EAAF. The results of the laboratory were determining that the remains belonged to the group of hostages between December 8 and 10, 1977. On September 15, 2005 Judge Cattani received the report stating that one of the individualized remains belonged to Angela Auad.Inhuman hoy los restos de la monja francesa On September 25, 2005, 28 years after she was murdered, Angela Auad was buried in the garden of the Church of Santa Cruz, in Buenos Aires, next to Sister L√©onie Duquet, one of the French nuns who were kidnapped with her.

This approach sticks to the principle that Israel is the first country in the Middle East to receive the newest fighter aircraft. The IAF was sufficiently committed to this principle to override protests from the leaders of Israeli defense contractors, who claimed that the deal was damaging them. The package also got by opposition from a number of members of the General Staff who criticized the high price of the deal, which does not allow for investment into weapons for the land forces and navy. The first squadron of 20 F-35 jets from the first production series would only include a few Israeli-made systems. The United States, meanwhile, has agreed that if Israel buys more F-35 squadrons from later production series, the installation of more Israeli- made systems will be allowed. To sweeten the deal, Lockheed Martin said it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies at a cost of $4 billion. The aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.Ben-David, Alon. \\"Israel To Buy F-35s With Cockpit Mods.\\" Aviation Week, 27 August 2010.

The total price tag confirmed by Barak indicates that each aircraft costs about $96 million, with further expenses on training, simulators, spare parts and the building of maintenance infrastructure.

Retrieved: 20 August 2010. Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz has contested the purchase. Steinitz contended that such an important decision, which has enormous defense and economic implications, should not be left to the Defense Minister, the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff and the Commander of the Air Force, but instead considered and approved by a senior group of ministers, including some with responsibility for economic issues. He got Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to promise that acquisition of the planes will be considered by a forum of senior ministers. Defense officials had argued that the purchase would be funded entirely by the military aid the United States gives Israel. But Steinitz countered that the purchase would also require a significant shekel outlay for pilot training, hangar construction and maintenance equipment, among other items. The finance minister said consideration also had to be given to Washington's opposition to the installation of Israeli systems and missiles on the plane. This would bar the plane from being outfitted with radar built by Israel Aerospace Industries' Elta division or missiles produced by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Finance Ministry officials said the ban on installing Israeli systems on the aircraft would be a major blow to Israel's defense industry. In particular, the purchase of American missiles would hurt development of new Israeli missile systems. The ban also prevents countries that purchase the aircraft from buying such Israeli military systems. This contrasts with previous American fighters, on which Israeli components have been installed. The US has agreed to reciprocal purchases of equipment from Israel's defense industries totaling between $4 billion and $9 billion, which Steinitz acknowledged could remedy this situation. Israel's three main areas of interest in customization are radar, electronic warfare and communications systems and independent maintenance capabilities.Katz, Yaakov. \\"Stealth power.\\" The Jerusalem Post, 19 November 2010 Richard Genaille, deputy head of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency, has said that installing different electronics on the F-35 would be very costly and \\"probably will not be in the best interest in the long run of\\" nations that make such changes.Wolf, Jim U.S. waits Japan nod on F-35 security pact Reuters, 9 September 2010 Israel's guarantees of more than US$4B of aerospace work in exchange for their purchase of 20 F-35s valued at US$2.7B, without any other industrial investment in the program has caused aerospace analysts to question what benefits countries who have invested in the F-35 program will receive. Norway, Denmark and Italy have all expressed concerns that the industrial benefits from the program may be insufficient to justify participation. On 16 September 2010, a ministerial panel headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak made a final decision to purchase 20 new F-35 fighter jets, despite opposition from a number of senior defense officials over the high cost of the deal. The Israelis have said that the F-35 would neutralize the threat of S-300 missiles that Russia is under contract to deliver to Iran. On 7 October 2010, Ehud Shani, director general of the Israeli Ministry of Defense signed the deal while in New York City. Israel was to get 20 of the warplanes for nearly $3 billion and receive the jets in 2016, while retaining an option for the purchase of additional 75 aircraft. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has said that the deal will destabilize the region.. In November 2010, Israel was reportedly offered an additional 20 F-35s in exchange for a continued freeze on Israeli settlements in the West Bank,Harel, Amos \\"MESS Report: Obama has made an offer Netanyahu cannot refuse.\\" Haaretz, 15 November 2010 however State Department spokesman P.J.

Gur Laish, an expert on the IAF with the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) at Tel Aviv University, wrote a report that indicates that the F-35 will have a deterrent effect with its ability to make pre-emptive attacks on hostile countries before war is declared, such as on Iran's nuclear facilities. Yiftah S. Shapir, also of the INSS at Tel Aviv University, said that the American refusal to open the fighter to full Israeli control and modification, including making the software codes available, reduces its value, but that the American relationship with Israel is so important that it rules out other alternatives such as the Sukhoi Su-57. He also noted that the earliest deliveries in 2016 would be past the date Iran is expected to have operational nuclear weapons, one of the prime reasons for having the F-35.\\"Israel 'needs F-35 to stay on top'.\\" UPI, 31 January 2011. In March 2011 it was announced that Israel will pay US$144.7M per aircraft for 19 F-35As, a price that includes a share of development, test and evaluation costs. With the delivery of the F-35s reportedly delayed until 2018, the Israelis have sought additional F-15s from the United States to cover the gap.KATZ, YAAKOV. \\"Expecting F-35 delay, IAF looking at purchase of used F-15s.\\" The Jerusalem Post, 13 April 2011. While being interviewed by Haaretz in May 2011, Ehud Shani said that \\"during the last visit by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to Israel a month ago, we were told that the delay may be shorter than they originally thought. In any case, I am not nervous about it. This [delay] may actually serve our interests. I favor an aircraft with as many Israeli-made systems as possible.\\" He also said that \\"we will see how they try to meet our requests over this time. In the original timetable, it was argued that there was no time [to incorporate Israeli systems into the Israeli F-35s]. We will hear their conclusions and I expect a dialogue with the Americans over the new timetable and the changes.\\" The idea that the Air Force will, in the meantime, acquire another squadron of F-15s in order to meet the gap that will be created \\"is not relevant,\\" he said. The delay may mean that in the future there will be more aircraft coming to Israel in a shorter period of time, and the numbers procured may rise from 20 to 30. Israeli defense officials said that the problems with the F-35 were 'much worse than we had been told' and that a high-level delegation would be sent to the United States to determine the extent of the problems.\\"Israeli official: Problems with F-35 'much worse than we had been told'.\\" World Tribune, 30 May 2011. Israel has planned to send pilots to train in the United States in 2017 then return to Israel with the 20 jets in 2018.Katz, Yaakov. \\"IAF discussing sending pilots to US for F-35 training.\\" JPost, 27 May 2011. According to a 7 July 2011 Aviation Week article, the United States has agreed to allow Israeli F-35s to be rewired so that Israeli electronic warfare systems can be installed on the aircraft. That would allow Israel to gradually add indigenous EW sensors and countermeasures on its fighters once it receives its first squadron. With that deal in hand, officials for both the IAF and Lockheed Martin expect the $2.7 billion contract for the procurement of 19 or 20 F-35As will be signed by early 2012. \\"I believe that Israel could receive its first F-35s in late 2016,\\" said Tom Burbage, Lockheed Martin's general manager of the F-35 program. A senior IAF official, who until then was concerned about delays in the program, said that the schedule agreed upon is \\"very satisfactory.\\" Israel insisted that only its own EW systems would be suitable to meet the developing anti-aircraft threat in the region, such as the deployment of SA-17 and SA-22 air defense systems in Syria. But now, claimed the official, \\"the F-35s we will receive will be more than ready to meet those threats.\\" The IAF initially presented a long list of unique and costly requirements for the JSF, but it has accepted that its first F-35s will be almost identical to those of the U.S. Air Force, with only Israeli command, control, computers, communications and intelligence systems installed in them. The plans to add Israeli EW systems, air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions as well as an external fuel tank, were approved in principle but will be deferred in order to protect the budgetary framework and delivery schedule. According to the program schedule, Israeli F-35s will be manufactured within the seventh and eighth low-rate initial production (LRIP) lot. The LRIP 5 cost is being negotiated by the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin. \\"Israel could still be the first international customer to receive the JSF,\\" said Burbage. One issue that remains to be settled between the two countries is when IAF crews will begin training on the F-35s and on whose platforms. Burbage said that training could commence in 2016, but it is for the Pentagon to decide which aircraft will be made available for Israeli training. Facing the possibility that the dramatic changes in the Middle East could turn peaceful neighbors Egypt and Jordan more hostile to Israel, the Israel Defense Forces aims to build a larger, more flexible force that will be capable of dealing with more than the traditional northern front of Syria and Lebanon. The IAF claims to be the only service with that flexibility, and it calls for accelerating the plan to procure 75 F-35s by 2030. In the coming years, the air force will begin decommissioning dozens of its aging fighters, such as F-16s and F-15s, and with only 20 new F-35s, its fighter fleet will reach its lowest point ever. However, there is strong competition for funding. Israeli ground commanders argue that because of the potential threat that the giant and modern Egyptian army would be turned against Israel, it is necessary to establish an additional mechanized division, equipped with Merkava tanks and the new Namer armored personnel carrier. The production of the Namer was moved to General Dynamics Land Systems in the U.S. in order to enable Israel to procure them using US military aid funding, the same funding source used to acquire the F-35s. According to the Jerusalem Post, IAF officers said on 31 July 2011 that they did not anticipate that the delivery date for the F-35 would slip beyond 2017. If it did, the IAF will need to consider other options for that time period, such as additional F-15s to fill the gap that would be created in the event that the JSF program is further delayed. On 1 August 2011, the Jerusalem Post reported that the IAF plans to purchase a second squadron of F-35s during the upcoming IDF multi-year procurement plan that is currently under review within the General Staff. The second contract would likely be of a similar number of aircraft and, depending on when the second deal is signed, the IAF could have 40 operational aircraft by the end of the decade.  2013  The Japanese government has discussed whether the export of F-35s containing Japanese products to Israel violates their laws against arms exports to countries involved in or likely to be involved in military conflicts.. Israeli military officials are reported to have said that the F-35 was chosen for its situational awareness capabilities.\\"Israel boosts air force 'pack of leopards.\\" UPI, 12 April 2013. The first two Israeli F-35As will be in LRIP 8.. In 2013, Lockheed Martin vice president, Steve O'Bryan, said that they were \\"examining the feasibility\\" of adding stealthy conformal fuel tanks manufactured by Elbit Systems.  2014  In October, Israel confirmed an order with the defence secretary for 25 more aircraft to equip a second squadron of F-35s. However, a ministerial committee member Yuval Steinitz, opposing the IDF plan, believed that order should possibly be halved due to concerns about the F-35's range, payload and maneuverability suiting Israel's needs.  2015  In February, Israel signed the contract for the procurement of another 14 F-35As in a $2.82 billion deal, with a unit cost of about $110 million. An option for another 17 aircraft is included in the contract. 2016 IAF F-35I Adir in Israel's Yom Ha'atzmaut flypast 2019. In June, the first Israeli F-35A was unveiled with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman present. The plane was to undergo further testing and actually be delivered in December. At the time it was stated that Israel had ordered 33 F-35s for delivery through 2021, with an option for 17 more. In November the Prime Minister's Office announced Israel was exercising the 17 options, after a unanimous vote of the Security Cabinet in favor, taking the total number of ordered examples to 50. On December 12, 2016, Israel received its first shipment of the F-35I Adir. Two Adirs landed in Israel and were received in a ceremony at Nevatim Airbase. The arrival of the F-35I will make Israel the first country to have an operational F-35 squadron outside of the United States, once the squadron is properly equipped. 2017 On 23 April 2017, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) received another three F-35I fighter jets. 2018 On May 22, 2018, Israel's Air force commander, Major General Amikam Norkin, reported that Israel became the first country in the world to use the F-35 in combat during recent clashes with Iran in Syria. 2019 In July 2019, Israel received two more F-35s, bringing the number of F-35s in the Israeli Air Force to 16. Planned introduction A model of an F-35 at Nevatim Air Force Base. The IAF's initial plans were to send pilots to the US in 2016 to begin training on the F-35 together with American pilots, and to take the first deliveries of F-35s in late 2016 or early 2017. It was announced in March 2013 that Israel would receive its first F-35s in 2015.. The Israeli F-35s will be based at Nevatim Airbase in the Negev. The decision was based on operational, environmental, infrastructure and training considerations, as well as the IDF's strategic vision to transfer some of its bases to the region. Israel is currently building the infrastructure needed to accommodate F-35s, including hardened aircraft shelters, underground pens, and maintenance facilities. In addition, the IAF has ordered 30 M-346 trainer jets to train F-35 pilots.. Construction of a manufacturing facility to produce wings under license for the F-35 was expected to be completed by mid-2014. The site is to produce a total of 811 wing pairs. Initial orders for the F-35 will be for 20 planes, with a total of 75 intended.. The first customized F-35I test platform is expected to be delivered to Israel by 2020. Former Israel Air Force chief Maj.-Gen. (res.) Amir Eshel has called the F-35 \\"game changing,\\" saying that Israel gathered new intelligence during a single flight by the F-35 early 2017 that other reconnaissance and intelligence gathering systems would take weeks to gather. The IAF had received nine aircraft and declared the fleet operational on 6 December 2017. Political impact The F-35 sale has been cited as one reason why there is little public pressure from Israel to stop the 2010 U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia.\\"Dealing arms responsibly.\\" The Jerusalem Post, 1 January 2012.

Between 1964-1975 the media in the United Kingdom and the United States had kept asbestos \\"high on the political agenda\\" and in the early 1970s ITV and the BBC had broadcast two programmes examining working conditions and occupational health at the Cape plant at Acre Mill. The first was World in Action: The Dust At Acre Mill, produced by Granada TV and broadcast on ITV in June 1971. This was followed in January 1975 by BBC TV's Horizon: The Killer Dust. As a result West Yorkshire MP Max Madden lodged an official complaint alleging non-enforcement of the Asbestos Industry Regulations 1931, which led to a Parliamentary Ombudsman Report being submitted to the Ombudsman, Sir Alan Marre. The report, which was highly critical of the behaviour of the Factory Inspectors at Acre Mill, found that since the plant's closure in 1970 10% of the work force had developed asbestosis, a figure far in excess of the previously estimated exposure-risk relationship. The government responded by launching a major inquiry, the Advisory Committee on Asbestos, or \\"Simpson Committee\\", in 1976. The committee delivered two interim reports and published their final report in October 1979. The final report \\"lack[ed] scientific research independent of the industrial sector\\" which \\"conditioned some of the final recommendations (e.g. on reducing threshold values and on the search for products that could replace the mineral), which were very reconciling and had very little impact on working conditions.\\" Concerns about the effect restrictions would have on employment figures also played a part in delaying implementation of the recommendations. Dissastisfied with the findings of the report, which appeared to favour the asbestos industry's position and contained \\"deceptive\\" statements from medical professionals in the pay of the industry, John Willis, assisted by researchers James Cutler and Peter Moore, began work on Alice... in 1980.

It is a Grade II* listed building. Pear Mill was one of the last cotton spinning mills to be built in England, commencing production in July 1913. The architects were A.H. Stott & Sons but due to difficulties in financing, it was completed by P.S. Stott. The building is typical of their work, with concrete floors and meticulous detailing. It was designed as a double mill, but the second mill was never built. The power was provided by a Manhattan type steam engine by George Saxon & Co. Transmission was by rope drives. The mill had 137,312 mule spindles which remained until the 1950s when they were replaced by 33,636 ring spindles, the mill being electrified at the same time. It ceased operation as a textile mill in March 1978.  Location  The mill was built next to the River Goyt; just outside of the Borough of Stockport. History The Pear Spinning Company, Lower Bredbury, was registered in 1907, with the intention of erecting a large double mill. It was one of the Stockport Limiteds mills, modelled on the Oldham Limiteds. It had a share capital of ¬£100,000 in ¬£5 shares. Work commenced in 1908, but the demand for cotton ended and it was difficult to raise capital. With ¬£55,000 spent, the shell of the mill had been completed when the company was put into liquidation in January 1912. In April a new company was floated to finish the mill. This was the Pear New Mill Limited ‚Äì it had a capital of ¬£90,000 in ¬£3 shares. Production started in July 1913 and the mill was fully equipped for spinning medium and fine counts by November. Immediately production was interrupted by the 1914‚Äì1918 war. The two years between 1918 and 1920 were years of an exceptional boom, and the 1912 company was refloated with a capital of ¬£250,000. This was the Pear New Mill (1919) Ltd company. The war had taken its toll on the Lancashire cotton industry and former markets such as India, China and Japan had built up their own spinning capacity. The price of cotton pieces fell to 38% of their 1913 value ‚Äì and though Pear New Mill did survive ‚Äì it lost its independence, and became part of Combined Egyptian Mills Ltd.  Architecture  This was a large six-storey mill with steel frame and cast iron columns; the floors were of concrete. It was built by Stott and Sons but when Abraham Stott Junior, was removed from the board of directors, the contract passed to his cousin and rival P.S. Stott. The mill had seven storeys if the cellar is counted, and attached are two-storey extensions for carding. The Office was separate from the mill. Stott mills were known for their careful detailing, extensively using terracotta to detail red Accrington brick and large windows. The window heads were flat, except on the top storey, where round-headed arches were used. The window heads were picked out in yellow brick. The Pear 'signature theme' of the building includes a large pear-shaped concrete cupola on top of the water tower at the South-East corner, and pear-shaped finials at each corner of the flat roof. Ornate terracotta friezes over the main entrances continue the theme with bas-relief depictions of pear tree leaves and fruit.  Power  It was powered by a George Saxon 5000 hp twin Manhattan Compound, made in 1912. Running at 180 psi, it had two 30 in HP cylinders and two 60 in low-pressure cylinder. It had a 4-foot-6-inch stroke and operated a 23-foot-diameter flywheel at rpm and 26 ropes; the flywheel had 73 rope grooves and was 15 feet wide, probably the widest in any cotton mill. It had drop valves on horizontal HP cylinders and Corliss valves on vertical LP cylinders. Tail rod support guides were on HP cylinders. Air pumps were driven from LP crossheads. It was removed by Mr Jim Price in 1962. The later ring frames were electrically driven.  Equipment  The mill had 52 pairs of spinning mules with a total of 137,312 spindles, and employed approximately 300 people. In 1929 the mill was acquired by Combined Egyptian Mills Ltd, a merger of 15 small companies that controlled over 30 mills. The building was modernised in the late 1950s when electrically driven ring frames were installed and in 1965 it was taken over by Carrington Viyella. Usage Originally it was designed to spin best Egyptian cottons, in what was technically termed \\"combed\\" and \\"super carded yarns.\\" However, in 1913 it started spinning mediums, 34s to 78s from American, Brazilian and Egyptian. By 1916 it had dropped Brazilian and did 40s to 90s, it then in 1917 purchased combing equipment and produced up to 120s then by 1929 it purchased Egyptian solely and ran 140s. They employed 300 people. The cotton count is a measure of the fineness if the yarn- the higher number being the finer. Egyptian cotton has the longest staple so is most suitable for fine counts.

Genealogy and Birth Cormac M√°c Shamhradh√°in was a member of the McGovern clan, rulers in the Middle Ages of the tuath of Teallach n-Eachach in Breifne (now Tullyhaw, County Cavan, Ireland). He was born c. 1410, probably in or near Drumlane Abbey, County Cavan, where his father, Piaras M√°g Shamhradh√°in O.S.A., was the Prior until his death in 1431.D√°n do Chormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in Easpag Ardachaidh by Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill in Seanchas Ardmhacha, vol. 4, no. 1 (1960‚Äì61), pp. 141‚Äì146. As the son of a priest, Cormac was definitionally illegitimate at birth. Cormac was descended from the chief who ruled Tullyhaw from 1258‚Äì1272, Donnchadh ‚ÄòCime‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in. His pedigree is Cormac mac Piaras mac Aindriu mac Cleiminnt mac Tom√°s Amhlaoibh mac Mac Craithe mac Donnchadh ‚ÄòCime‚Äô M√°g Samhradh√°in.  Priesthood and Drumlane Abbey Cormac was presumably educated at Drumlane Abbey which was founded about the 6th century AD by Saint Columba. The abbey was a chapter house of the Augustinian Abbey of Kells, County Meath that was dedicated to Saint Mary. Cormac was ordained a priest and joined the Augustinian Order, becoming a canon. On 10 April 1430 Cormac was awarded the rectory of Templeport on the death of the previous holder, Renaldus McGovern. The Papal Registers state- To the prior of Inchmacnerin (Insula Macneri) in the diocese of Elphin. Mandate to collate and assign to Cormac Magamrughan, Augustinian canon of St. Mary's de Kenlys in the diocese of Meath, who is of noble race, the rectory, value not exceeding 20 marks, wont to be held by canons of St. Mary's, of Teallacheach and Mageangady in the diocese of Kilmore, void by the death of Renaldus Magamrugham, summoning and removing the abbot and convent of the said monastery, who have unduly detained possession for more than two years, and whom he fears to meet within the city or diocese. He is hereby dispensed on account of his illegitimacy as the son of a canon of the said order, a priest, and an unmarried woman. On the death of his father Piaras in 1431, Cormac succeeded to the post of Prior of Drumlane due to hereditary succession rights. He would have been in his early twenties at the time. The McGovern clan, through the ages, were associated with Drumlane and, in the 15th century alone, at least five of its members were appointed Prior. The ecclesiastical offices in Drumlane (Abbott, Prior, Parish Priest) were generally split between the McGoverns who were the hereditary erenachs, and the O'Farrellys who were the hereditary coarbs of Drumlane. In Canon Law, the right to appoint the Prior was reserved to the Pope and so in 1436, the matter of succession was submitted to Pope Eugene IV. He appointed the Archdeacon of Hainault in Liege to settle the matter by examining Cormac and other witnesses. As a result, Cormac was deprived of the office and Patrick O'Farrelly was appointed.Calendar of Papal Letters, vol. VIII, p.585 O'Farrelly died c.1439 and Cormac then reclaimed possession of the Priory on the plea dispositionis ordinarie (collation by the ordinary). On Cormac's 1444 elevation to the See of Ardagh, the Pope appointed Thady Magauran as Prior of Drumlane.De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p. 251.  Bishop of Ardagh On the death of Risde√°rd √ì Fearghail, the Bishop of Ardagh, in 1444, the local Ardagh clergy selected \\"the young official MacMuircherty\\" (probably Tomas mac Murchada who was Dean of Ardagh in 1468) as their candidate for bishop and forwarded their recommendation to the Pope.The Annals of Kingdom of Ireland, J. O'Donovan, Ed. (1851), p. 933, Year 1444 AD. This proposal was rejected by the Vatican and Cormac M√°c Shamhradh√°in was appointed on 6 November 1444 by Pope Eugene IV. Cormac also secured a dispensation from the illegitimacy that would have barred him from episcopal office.Calendar of Papal Letters, vol. IX, pp.436 & 459 On 19 November 1444, Cormac was licensed to be consecrated by bishops of his choice. Cormac evidently won the appointment because he travelled to Rome to plead his case, while MacMuircherty remained in Ireland. Cormac probably used his influence with the Augustinians to support his petition. The Pope may have offered the office of Drumlane Prior to the Pope as a quid pro quo for the Ardagh bishopric. Excommunication Cormac returned to Ireland in 1445, and paid a fee of 33 florins for his appointment on 19 February 1445. The Ardagh clergy initially accepted his authority. MacFirbis Annals for 1445 state ‚ÄúThe Bishop Magsamhradhan came from Rome and obtained the episcopacie of Ardachadh, and the Quire of Ardachadh, and young Officiall mcMuircherty, that was elected afore him, obeyed him haveing the Popes authoritie from Rome.‚ÄùThe Annals of Ireland, from the Year 1443 to 1468, translated from the Irish by Dudley Firbisse, or, as he is more usually called, Duald Mac Firbis, for Sir James Ware, in the Year 1666) (Ed. John O'Donovan) in Miscellany of the Irish Archaeological Society, Vol. I (Dublin 1848), 1445 p. 210 This state of affairs did not last long, as he was not a native of the diocese and throughout his tenure they attempted to have him deposed. At the end of 1451, Cormac was excommunicated by the Archbishop of Armagh John Mey, for his failure to pay metropolitan dues and submit to the Archbishop's Visitation and for fornication. Two of the Ardagh clergy were appointed by Mey to publicise the excommunication and offer absolution.Registrum Iohannis Mey, eds. W.G. Quigley & E.F.D. Roberts (Belfast 1972), p. 264. On 9 June 1460 Cormac attended the Provincial Synod of Armagh held under Archbishop John Bole at St. Peter's Church, Drogheda. In 1463 Sea√°n √ì Fearghail went to Rome to ask the pope to confirm him as bishop of Ardagh in lieu of Cormac and a writ of King Edward III of England dated 1463 describes Sean as bishop-elect of Ardagh, but he was never consecrated, probably because of his role at the same time in attempting to remove the Bishop of Cork and Cloyne Jordan Purcell using forged documents. Matters came to a head when Cormac offered his resignation to Pope Paul II in 1467 and on 12 October 1467 Donnchadh O'Fearghail was appointed Bishop of Ardagh, but he died before the Papal Bull was expedited.De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p.185. The diocese was seemingly without an appointed bishop until 28 July 1469, when Sea√°n √ì Fearghail was appointed Bishop of Ardagh.De Annatis Hiberniae, ed. M.A. Costello 1909, vol I, p.186. However, these latter two appointments may not have reflected the actual situation in Ardagh diocese. There is evidence that Cormac reigned as bishop until his death in 1476 and only then did Fearghail take over. For example, in April‚ÄìMay 1470 Archbishop Bole stated that Cormac was bishop of ArdaghThe Register of Octavian de Palatio, Archbishop of Armagh 1478‚Äì1513 ff. 245v, 270v and the Annals of Connacht for the year 1476 state- \\"Bishop Mag Samradain died and Sean son of Brian succeeded him\\".Ann√°la Connacht: The Annals of Connacht, ed. A. Martin Freeman (1944), Year 1476.7, p. 577. Death According to the Annals of Ireland, Cormac died in 1476 but his death was separately given as 1478, probably in error.The Annals of Kingdom of Ireland, J. O‚ÄôDonovan, Ed. (1851), p. 1098, Year 1476 AD. After his death a praise poem was written in his honour, giving his ancestry.D√°n do Chormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in Easpag Ardachaidh by Gear√≥id Mac Niocaill in Seanchas Ardmhacha, vol. 4, no. 1 (1960‚Äì61), pp. 141‚Äì146. It was probably composed c. 1487 by Diarmaid Bacach Mac Parrthal√°in, a native of Tullyhaw and a scribe under the patronage of the McGovern chief.  Descendants Cormac left at least one son, also named Cormac M√°g Shamhradh√°in who was born c. 1442. Like his father he was illegitimate and became the Prior of Drumlane in 1466. He was a priest in Templeport parish in 1461. His subsequent appointment as Bishop of Kilmore on 4 November 1476 was revoked on 20 October 1480 due to this illegitimacy. The son appealed the matter on several occasions and still held himself as Bishop of Kilmore upon his death in December 1511.
