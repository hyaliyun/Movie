In a null cipher, the plaintext is included within the ciphertext and one needs to discard certain characters in order to decrypt the message.

Historically, users of concealment ciphers often used substitution and transposition ciphers on the data prior to concealment. For example, Cardinal Richelieu is said to have used a grille to write secret messages, after which the blank spaces were filled out with extraneous matter to create the impression of a continuous text.  Usage  In general, it is difficult and time-consuming to produce covertexts that seem natural and would not raise suspicion. If no key or actual encryption is involved, the security of the message relies entirely on the secrecy of the concealment method.

His successful martial career made him one of the richest and most influential men in the Holy Roman Empire by the time of his death. Wallenstein became the supreme commander of the armies of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II and was a major figure of the Thirty Years' War. Wallenstein was born in the Kingdom of Bohemia into a poor Protestant noble family. He acquired a multilingual university education across Europe and converted to Catholicism in 1606. A marriage in 1609 to the wealthy widow of a Bohemian landowner gave him access to considerable estates and wealth after her death at an early age in 1614. Three years later, Wallenstein embarked on a career as a mercenary by raising forces for the Holy Roman Emperor in the War of Gradisca against the Republic of Venice. Wallenstein fought for the Catholics in the Protestant Bohemian revolt of 1618 and was awarded estates confiscated from the rebels after their defeat at White Mountain in 1620. A series of military victories against the Protestants raised Wallenstein's reputation in the Imperial court and in 1625 he raised a large army of 50,000 men to further the Imperial cause. A year later, he administered a crushing defeat to the Protestants at Dessau Bridge. For his successes, Wallenstein became an Imperial count palatine and made himself ruler of the lands of the Duchy of Friedland in northern Bohemia. An imperial generalissimo by land, and Admiral of the Baltic Sea from 21 April 1628, Wallenstein found himself released from service in 1630 after Ferdinand grew wary of his ambition. Several Protestant victories over Catholic armies induced Ferdinand to recall Wallenstein (Gollersdorf April 1632), who then defeated the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus at Alte Veste and fought him to a draw at F√ºrth, the Swedish king was later killed at the Battle of L√ºtzen. Wallenstein realised the war could last decades and, during the summer of 1633, arranged a series of armistices to negotiate peace. These proved to be his undoing as plotters accused him of treachery and Emperor Ferdinand II ordered his assassination. Dissatisfied with the Emperor's treatment of him, Wallenstein considered allying with the Protestants. However, he was assassinated at Eger in Bohemia by one of the army's officials, with the emperor's approval. Early life Wallenstein was born on 24 September 1583 in He≈ômanice, Bohemia, which is the easternmost and largest region in what was then the Holy Roman Empire, in the present-day Czech Republic, into a poor Protestant branch of the Waldstein (Wallenstein, Vald≈°tejn) family who owned He≈ômanice castle and seven surrounding villages. His mother, Mark√©ta Smi≈ôick√° of Smi≈ôice, died in 1593; his father, Vil√©m, died in 1595. They had raised him bilingually ‚Äì the father spoke German while his mother preferred Czech ‚Äì yet Wallenstein in his childhood had a better command of Czech than of German. His parents' religious affiliations were Lutheranism and Utraquist Hussitism. After their deaths, Albrecht for two years lived with his maternal uncle Heinrich (Jind≈ôich) Slavata of Chlum and Ko≈°umberk, a member of the Unity of the Brethren (Bohemian Brethren), and adopted his uncle's religious affiliation. His uncle sent him to the brethren's school at Ko≈°umberk Castle in Eastern Bohemia. In 1597, Albrecht was sent to the Protestant Latin school at Goldberg (now Z≈Çotoryja) in Silesia, where the then-German environment led him to hone his German language skills. While German became Wallenstein's lingua franca, he is said to have continued to curse in Czech. On 29 August 1599, Wallenstein continued his education at the Protestant University of Altdorf near Nuremberg, Franconia, where he was often engaged in brawls and √©p√©e fights, leading to his imprisonment in the town prison. He beat his servant so badly he had to purchase him a new suit of clothes on top of paying compensation.Wallenstein his life narrated by Golo Mann. In February 1600, Albrecht left Altdorf and travelled around the Holy Roman Empire, France and Italy, where he studied at the universities of Bologna and Padua. By this time, Wallenstein was fluent in German, Czech, Latin and Italian, was able to understand Spanish, and spoke some French. Wallenstein then joined the army of the Emperor Rudolf II in Hungary, where, under the command of Giorgio Basta, he saw two years of armed service (1604‚Äì1606) against the Ottoman Turks and Hungarian rebels. Isabelle von Harrach, Wallenstein's second wife In 1604, his sister, Kate≈ôina Anna, married the leader of the Moravian Protestants, Karel the Older of Zierotin. He then studied at the University of Olomouc (matriculating in 1606). His contact with the Olomouc Jesuits is considered to be at least partially responsible for his conversion to Catholicism that same year. The contributory factor to his conversion may have been the Counter- Reformation policy of the Habsburgs that effectively barred Protestants from being appointed to higher offices at court in Bohemia and in Moravia, and the impressions he gathered in Catholic Italy. However, there are no sources clearly indicating the reasons for Wallenstein's conversion, except for a subjunctive anecdote by his contemporary Franz Christoph von Khevenh√ºller about the Virgin Mary saving Wallenstein's life when he fell from a window in Innsbruck. Wallenstein was later made a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1607, based on recommendations by his brother-in-law, Zierotin, and another relative, Adam of Waldstein, often mistakenly referred to as his uncle, Wallenstein was made chamberlain at the court of Matthias, and later also chamberlain to archdukes Ferdinand and Maximilian. In 1609, Wallenstein married the Czech Lucretia of V√≠ckov, n√©e Nek≈°ov√°, of Landek, the wealthy widow of Arkleb of V√≠ckov who owned the towns of Vset√≠n, Lukov, Rymice and V≈°etuly/Hole≈°ov (all in eastern Moravia). She was three years older than Wallenstein, and he inherited her estates after her death in 1614. He used his wealth to win favour, offering and commanding 200 horses for Archduke Ferdinand of Styria for his war with Venice in 1617, thereby relieving the fortress of Gradisca from the Venetian siege.Di Bert, Marino Vicende storiche gradiscane, Societ√† Filologica Friulana, Udine, pp. 65‚Äì104. He later endowed a monastery in his late wife's name and had her reburied there. In 1623, Wallenstein married Isabella Katharina, daughter of Count von Harrach. She bore him two children: a son who died in infancy and a surviving daughter. Examples of the couple's correspondence survive. The two marriages made him one of the wealthiest men in the Bohemian Crown. Thirty Years' War The Wallenstein Palace in Prague The Thirty Years' War began in 1618 when the estates of Bohemia rebelled against Ferdinand of Styria and elected Frederick V, Elector Palatine, the leader of the Protestant Union, as their new king. Wallenstein associated himself with the cause of the Catholics and the Habsburg dynasty. In the summer of 1618 Count Thurn led 10,000 troops into Moravia to secure their loyalty to the rebellion. Nobles who wished for a rapprochement with Ferdinand faced a choice. Senior nobleman Zierotin's son- in-law, Georg von Nachod, commanded the Moravian cavalry and his brother-in- law, Wallenstein, the infantry. Both decided to take their regiment into Austria. Nachod's troops rebelled and he fled for his life. Wallenstein's major demanded authorisation from the Estates upon which Wallenstein drew his sword and ran him through,\\"A fresh major was immediately appointed and displayed greater tractability\\". Deserting the Bohemians, he marched his regiment to Vienna taking with him the Moravian treasury. There, however, the authorities told him that the money would go back to the Moravians ‚Äì but he had shown his loyalty to Ferdinand, the future Emperor. Wallenstein equipped a regiment of cuirassiers and won great distinction under Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy in the wars against Ernst von Mansfeld and Gabriel Bethlen (both supporters of the Bohemian revolt) in Moravia. Wallenstein recovered his lands (which the rebels had seized in 1619) and after the Battle of White Mountain (8 November 1620) he secured the estates belonging to his mother's family and confiscated tracts of Protestant lands. He grouped his new possessions into a territory called Friedland (Fr√Ωdlant) in northern Bohemia. A series of successes in battle led to Wallenstein becoming in 1622 an imperial count palatine, in 1623 a prince, and in 1625 Duke of Friedland.Schiller, J. Friedrich Von. (1980) Robbers and Wallenstein, Penguin Classics, pp. 12‚Äì3. .

Ceiling decoration in the main hall of the Wallenstein Palace In order to aid Ferdinand (elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1619) against the Northern Protestants and to produce a balance in the Army of the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, Wallenstein offered to raise a whole army for the imperial service following the bellum se ipsum alet principle, and received his final commission on 25 July 1625. Wallenstein's successes as a military commander brought him fiscal credit, which in turn enabled him to receive loans to buy lands, many of them being the former estates of conquered Bohemian nobles. He used his credit to grant loans to Ferdinand II, which were repaid through lands and titles.JP Cooper, \\"The New Cambridge Modern History\\" The Thirty Years' War 1st ed.

This awarding of a major territory to someone of the lower nobility shocked the high-born rulers of many other German states.Wedgwood, C.V. (1961) The Thirty Years' War, Anchor Books, pp. 219‚Äì20. Wallenstein assumed the title of \\"Admiral of the North and Baltic Seas\\". However, in 1628 he failed to capture Stralsund, which resisted the Capitulation of Franzburg and the subsequent siege with assistance of Danish, Scottish and Swedish troops, a blow that denied him access to the Baltic and the chance to challenge the naval power of the Scandinavian kingdoms and of the Netherlands. Although he succeeded in defeating Christian IV of Denmark in the Battle of Wolgast and neutralizing Denmark in the subsequent Peace of L√ºbeck, the situation further deteriorated when the presence of Imperial Catholic troops on the Baltic and the Emperor's \\"Edict of Restitution\\" brought King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden into the conflict. Wallenstein attempted to aid the forces of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth under Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski, which were fighting Sweden in 1629. However, Wallenstein failed to engage any major Swedish forces and this significantly affected the outcome of the conflict.Dahlquist, Germund Wilhelm & Carl Von Clausewitz. (2003) Principles of War, Courier Dover Publications, p. 81. . Engraving of Albrecht von Wallenstein Over the course of the war Wallenstein's ambitions and the abuses of his forces had earned him a host of enemies, both Catholic and Protestant, princes and non-princes alike. Ferdinand suspected Wallenstein of planning a coup to take control of the Holy Roman Empire. The Emperor's advisors advocated dismissing him, and in September 1630 envoys were sent to Wallenstein to announce his dismissal. The decision was taken at Regensburg on 13 August 1630 on the following day Wallenstein's financier De Witte committed suicide (having accrued a mountain of debt financing Wallenstein). Wallenstein gave over his army to General Tilly and retired to Jiƒç√≠n, the capital of his Duchy of Friedland. There he lived in an atmosphere of \\"mysterious magnificence\\".Ingrao, Charles W. (2000) The Habsburg Monarchy, 1618‚Äì1815, Cambridge University Press, pp. 45‚Äì46; . However, circumstances forced Ferdinand to recall Wallenstein into the field. The successes of Gustavus Adolphus over General Tilly at the Battle of Breitenfeld and the Lech (1632), where Tilly was killed, and his advance to Munich and occupation of Bohemia, required a vigorous response. It was during this time that Wallenstein had taken inspiration from the reforms of Gustavus Adolphus, instituting harsh discipline by providing rewards for bravery and punishment for disorder, thievery, and cowardice and with this in mind Wallenstein raised a fresh army within a few weeks and took to the field. He drove the Saxon army from Bohemia and then advanced against Gustavus Adolphus, whom he opposed near Nuremberg and, after the Battle of the Alte Veste, dislodged. In November the great Battle of L√ºtzen was fought, in which Wallenstein was forced to retreat but, in the confused melee, Gustavus Adolphus was killed. Wallenstein withdrew to winter quarters in Bohemia. Wallenstein's camp In the campaigning of 1633, Wallenstein's apparent unwillingness to attack the enemy caused much concern in Vienna and in Spain. At this time the dimensions of the war had grown more European, and Wallenstein had begun preparing to desert the Emperor. He expressed anger at Ferdinand's refusal to revoke the Edict of Restitution. Historic records tell little about his secret negotiations but some sources indicated he was preparing to force a \\"just peace\\" on the Emperor \\"in the interests of united Germany\\". With this apparent \\"plan\\" he entered into negotiations with Saxony, Brandenburg, Sweden, and France. Apparently the Habsburgs' enemies tried to draw him to their side. In any case, he gained little support. Anxious to make his power felt, he resumed the offensive against the Swedes and Saxons, winning his last victory at Steinau on the Oder in October. He then resumed negotiations. Assassination Eger/Cheb In December Wallenstein retired with his army to Bohemia, around Pilsen (now Plze≈à). Vienna soon definitely convinced itself of his treachery, a secret court found him guilty, and the Emperor looked seriously for a means of getting rid of him (a successor in command, the later emperor Ferdinand III, was already waiting). Wallenstein was aware of the plan to replace him, but felt confident that when the army came to decide between him and the Emperor the decision would be in his favour. On 24 January 1634 the Emperor signed a secret patent (shown only to certain officers of Wallenstein's army) removing him from his command. Finally an open patent charging Wallenstein with high treason was signed on 18 February and published in Prague. In the patent, Ferdinand II ordered to have Wallenstein brought under arrest to Vienna, dead or alive. Losing the support of his army, Wallenstein now realized the extent of his peril, and on 23 February with a company of some hundred men, he went from Plze≈à to Eger/Cheb, hoping to meet the Swedes under Prince Bernhard. After his arrival at Cheb, however, certain senior Scottish and Irish officers in his force assassinated him on the night of February 25. To carry out the assassination, a regiment of dragoons under the command of an Irish colonel, Walter ButlerProjekt Runeberg: Walter Butler, runeberg.org; accessed April 17, 2017. and the Scots colonels Walter Leslie and John Gordon first fell upon Wallenstein's trusted officers Adam Trczka, Vil√©m Kinsk√Ω, Christian Illov and Henry Neumann while the latter attended a feast at Cheb Castle (which had come under the command of Gordon himself), and massacred them. Trczka alone managed to fight his way out into the courtyard, only to be shot down by a group of musketeers. A few hours later, an Irish captain, Walter Devereux, together with a few companions, broke into the burgomaster's house at the main square where Wallenstein had his lodgings (again courtesy of Gordon), and kicked open the bedroom door. Devereux then ran his halberd through the unarmed Wallenstein, who, roused from sleep, is said to have asked in vain for quarter. The Holy Roman Emperor had given free rein to the parties he knew wished \\"to bring in Wallenstein, alive or dead\\". After the assassination, he rewarded them.The Encyclopedia of World History (6th edition) Wallenstein was buried at Jiƒç√≠n. In 1785, his remains were moved to Mnichovo Hradi≈°tƒõ.

Harvesting oats with a Claas Lexion 570 harvester with enclosed air-conditioned cab, rotary thresher and laser-guided automatic steering Henty, Australia, region John Deere Combine 9870 STS with 625D The modern combine harvester, or simply combine, is a versatile machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of grain crops. The name derives from its combining three separate harvesting operations‚Äîreaping, threshing, and winnowing‚Äîinto a single process. Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), sorghum, soybeans, flax (linseed), sunflowers and canola. The separated straw, left lying on the field, comprises the stems and any remaining leaves of the crop with limited nutrients left in it: the straw is then either chopped, spread on the field and ploughed back in or baled for bedding and limited-feed for livestock. Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labour saving inventions, significantly reducing the fraction of the population engaged in agriculture. History In 1826 in Scotland, the inventor Reverend Patrick Bell designed (but did not patent) a reaper machine, which used the scissors principle of plant cutting ‚Äì a principle that is still used today. The Bell machine was pushed by horses. A few Bell machines were available in the United States. In 1835, in the United States, Hiram Moore built and patented the first combine harvester, which was capable of reaping, threshing and winnowing cereal grain. Early versions were pulled by horse, mule or ox teams. In 1835, Moore built a full-scale version with a length of 5.2 m (17 ft) and a cut width of 4.57 m (15 ft); by 1839, over of crops were harvested. This combine harvester was pulled by 20 horses fully handled by farmhands. By 1860, combine harvesters with a cutting, or swathe, width of several metres were used on American farms. A parallel development in Australia saw the development of the stripper based on the Gallic stripper, by John Ridley and others in South Australia by 1843. The stripper only gathered the heads, leaving the stems in the field. The stripper and later headers had the advantage of less moving parts and only collecting heads, requiring less power to operate.

In 1911, the Holt Manufacturing Company of California produced a self-propelled harvester.The John Deere Tractor Legacy, Don McMillan, Voyageur Press, 2003, page 118 with photo In Australia in 1923, the patented Sunshine Auto Header was one of the first center-feeding self-propelled harvesters.Remarkable Australian Farm Machines, Graeme R.

In 1923 in Kansas, the Baldwin brothers and their Gleaner Manufacturing Company patented a self-propelled harvester that included several other modern improvements in grain handling.Gleaner: 85 Years of Harvest History, Gleaner Agco Company, 2008, page 8 Both the Gleaner and the Sunshine used Fordson engines; early Gleaners used the entire Fordson chassis and driveline as a platform. In 1929, Alfredo Rotania of Argentina patented a self-propelled harvester.La maquinaria que har√≠a historia, La Nacion, 6 Nov 2004 (Spanish) International Harvester started making horse-pulled combines in 1915. At the time, horse powered binders and stand alone threshing machines were more common. In the 1920s, Case Corporation and John Deere made combines and these were starting to be tractor pulled with a second engine aboard the combine to power its workings. The world economic collapse in the 1930s stopped farm equipment purchases, and for this reason, people largely retained the older method of harvesting. A few farms did invest and used Caterpillar tractors to move the outfits. Tractor- drawn combines (also called pull-type combines) became common after World War II as many farms began to use tractors. An example was the All-Crop Harvester series. These combines used a shaker to separate the grain from the chaff and straw-walkers (grates with small teeth on an eccentric shaft) to eject the straw while retaining the grain. Early tractor-drawn combines were usually powered by a separate gasoline engine, while later models were PTO-powered, via a shaft transferring tractor engine power to operate the combine. These machines either put the harvested crop into bags that were then loaded onto a wagon or truck, or had a small bin that stored the grain until it was transferred via a chute. In the U.S., Allis-Chalmers, Massey-Harris, International Harvester, Gleaner Manufacturing Company, John Deere, and Minneapolis Moline are past or present major combine producers. In 1937, the Australian-born Thomas Carroll, working for Massey-Harris in Canada, perfected a self-propelled model and in 1940, a lighter-weight model began to be marketed widely by the company.\\"Carroll, Thomas (Tom) (1888‚Äì1968)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography Lyle Yost invented an auger that would lift grain out of a combine in 1947, making unloading grain much easier and further from the combine. In 1952 Claeys launched the first self-propelled combine harvester in Europe;CARROL J.: The World Encyclopedia of Tractors & Farm Machinery, 1999 Annes Piblisching Ltd, p. 127 in 1953, the European manufacturer Claas developed a self-propelled combine harvester named 'Hercules', it could harvest up to 5 tons of wheat a day.Timesonline.co.uk, access date 31-09-2009 This newer kind of combine is still in use and is powered by diesel or gasoline engines. Until the self-cleaning rotary screen was invented in the mid-1960s combine engines suffered from overheating as the chaff spewed out when harvesting small grains would clog radiators, blocking the airflow needed for cooling. A significant advance in the design of combines was the rotary design. The grain is initially stripped from the stalk by passing along a helical rotor, instead of passing between rasp bars on the outside of a cylinder and a concave. Rotary combines were first introduced by Sperry-New Holland in 1975. In about the 1980s on-board electronics were introduced to measure threshing efficiency. This new instrumentation allowed operators to get better grain yields by optimizing ground speed and other operating parameters. The largest \\"class 10\\" combines today have nearly 800 engine horsepower (600 kW) and are fitted with headers up to wide. A New Holland TX68 with grain platform attached. A John Deere Titan series combine unloading corn. Combine header Combines are equipped with removable header that are designed for particular crops.

A variation of the platform, a \\"flex\\" platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains. Some wheat headers, called \\"draper\\" headers, use a fabric or rubber apron instead of a cross auger. Draper headers allow faster feeding than cross augers, leading to higher throughputs due to lower power requirements. On many farms, platform headers are used to cut wheat, instead of separate wheat headers, so as to reduce overall costs. Dummy heads or pick-up headers feature spring- tined pickups, usually attached to a heavy rubber belt. They are used for crops that have already been cut and placed in windrows or swaths. This is particularly useful in northern climates such as western Canada, where swathing kills weeds resulting in a faster dry down. While a grain platform can be used for corn, a specialized corn head is ordinarily used instead. The corn head is equipped with snap rolls that strip the stalk and leaf away from the ear, so that only the ear (and husk) enter the throat. This improves efficiency dramatically, since so much less material must go through the cylinder. The corn head can be recognized by the presence of points between each row. Occasionally rowcrop heads are seen that function like a grain platform, but have points between rows like a corn head. These are used to reduce the amount of weed seed picked up when harvesting small grains. Self- propelled Gleaner combines could be fitted with special tracks instead of tires to assist in harvesting rice. These tracks can be made to fit other combines by adding adapter plates. Some combines, particularly the pull type, have tires with a deep diamond tread which prevents sinking in mud. Conventional combine The cut crop is carried up the feeder throat (commonly called the \\"feederhouse\\"), by a chain and flight elevator, then fed into the threshing mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating threshing drum (commonly called the \\"cylinder\\"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through the action of the cylinder against the concave, a shaped \\"half drum\\", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than \\"float\\" across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines. Hillside leveling Palouse hills A Massey Ferguson combine fitted with the hillside leveling option In the Palouse region of the Pacific Northwest of the United States the combine is retrofitted with a hydraulic hillside leveling system. This allows the combine to harvest the steep but fertile soil in the region. Hillsides can be as steep as a 50% slope. Gleaner, IH and Case IH, John Deere, and others all have made combines with this hillside leveling system, and local machine shops have fabricated them as an aftermarket add-on. The first leveling technology was developed by Holt Co., a California firm, in 1891. Modern leveling came into being with the invention and patent of a level sensitive mercury switch system invented by Raymond Alvah Hanson in 1946.Rahco.com, 2005 Raymond's son, Raymond, Jr., produced leveling systems exclusively for John Deere combines until 1995 as R. A. Hanson Company, Inc. In 1995, his son, Richard, purchased the company from his father and renamed it RAHCO International, Inc. In March 2011, the company was renamed Hanson Worldwide, LLC.2012 Production continues to this day. Hillside leveling has several advantages. Primary among them is an increased threshing efficiency on hillsides. Without leveling, grain and chaff slide to one side of separator and come through the machine in a large ball rather than being separated, dumping large amounts of grain on the ground. By keeping the machinery level, the straw-walker is able to operate more efficiently, making for more efficient threshing. IH produced the 453 combine which leveled both side-to- side and front-to-back, enabling efficient threshing whether on a hillside or climbing a hill head on. Secondarily, leveling changes a combine's center of gravity relative to the hill and allows the combine to harvest along the contour of a hill without tipping, a danger on the steeper slopes of the region; it is not uncommon for combines to roll over on extremely steep hills. Newer leveling systems do not have as much tilt as the older ones. A John Deere 9600 combine equipped with a Rahco hillside conversion kit will level to 44%, while the newer STS combines will only go to 35%. These modern combines use the rotary grain separator which makes leveling less critical. Most combines on the Palouse have dual drive wheels on each side to stabilize them. A leveling system was developed in Europe by the Italian combine manufacturer Laverda, which still produces it today. Sidehill leveling Sidehill combines are very similar to hillside combines in that they level the combine to the ground so that the threshing can be efficiently conducted; however, they have some very distinct differences. Modern hillside combines level around 35% on average, while older machines were closer to 50%. Sidehill combines only level to 18%. They are sparsely used in the Palouse region. Rather, they are used on the gentle rolling slopes of the midwest. Sidehill combines are much more mass-produced than their hillside counterparts. The height of a sidehill machine is the same height as a level-land combine. Hillside combines have added steel that sets them up approximately 2‚Äì5 feet higher than a level-land combine and provide a smooth ride. Maintaining threshing speed Allis-Chalmers GLEANER L2 Another technology that is sometimes used on combines is a continuously variable transmission. This allows the ground speed of the machine to be varied while maintaining a constant engine and threshing speed. It is desirable to keep the threshing speed constant since the machine will typically have been adjusted to operate best at a certain speed. Self-propelled combines started with standard manual transmissions that provided one speed based on input rpm. Deficiencies were noted and in the early 1950s combines were equipped with what John Deere called the \\"Variable Speed Drive\\". This was simply a variable width sheave controlled by spring and hydraulic pressures. This sheave was attached to the input shaft of the transmission. A standard 4 speed manual transmission was still used in this drive system. The operator would select a gear, typically 3rd. An extra control was provided to the operator to allow him to speed up and slow down the machine within the limits provided by the variable speed drive system. By decreasing the width of the sheave on the input shaft of the transmission, the belt would ride higher in the groove. This slowed the rotating speed on the input shaft of the transmission, thus slowing the ground speed for that gear. A clutch was still provided to allow the operator to stop the machine and change transmission gears. Later, as hydraulic technology improved, hydrostatic transmissions were introduced by Versatile Mfg for use on swathers but later this technology was applied to combines as well. This drive retained the 4 speed manual transmission as before, but this time used a system of hydraulic pumps and motors to drive the input shaft of the transmission. This system is called a Hydrostatic drive system. The engine turns the hydraulic pump capable of pressures up to . This pressure is then directed to the hydraulic motor that is connected to the input shaft of the transmission. The operator is provided with a lever in the cab that allows for the control of the hydraulic motor's ability to use the energy provided by the pump. By adjusting the swash plate in the motor, the stroke of its pistons are changed. If the swash plate is set to neutral, the pistons do not move in their bores and no rotation is allowed, thus the machine does not move. By moving the lever, the swash plate moves its attached pistons forward, thus allowing them to move within the bore and causing the motor to turn. This provides an infinitely variable speed control from 0 ground speed to what ever the maximum speed is allowed by the gear selection of the transmission. The standard clutch was removed from this drive system as it was no longer needed. Most if not all modern combines are equipped with hydrostatic drives. These are larger versions of the same system used in consumer and commercial lawn mowers that most are familiar with today. In fact, it was the downsizing of the combine drive system that placed these drive systems into mowers and other machines.

First, the header, described above, cuts the crop and feeds it into the threshing cylinder. This consists of a series of horizontal rasp bars fixed across the path of the crop and in the shape of a quarter cylinder. Moving rasp bars or rub bars pull the crop through concaved grates that separate the grain and chaff from the straw. The grain heads fall through the fixed concaves. What happens next is dependent on the type of combine in question. In most modern combines, the grain is transported to the shoe by a set of 2, 3, or 4 (possibly more on the largest machines) augers, set parallel or semi-parallel to the rotor on axial mounted rotors and perpendicular on \\"Axial Flow\\" combines. In older Gleaner machines, these augers were not present. Those combines are unique in that the cylinder and concave is set inside feederhouse instead of in the machine directly behind the feederhouse. Consequently, the material was moved by a \\"raddle chain\\" from underneath the concave to the walkers. The clean grain fell between the raddle and the walkers onto the shoe, while the straw, being longer and lighter, floated across onto the walkers to be expelled. On most other older machines, the cylinder was placed higher and farther back in the machine, and the grain moved to the shoe by falling down a \\"clean grain pan\\", and the straw \\"floated\\" across the concaves to the back of the walkers. Since the Sperry-New Holland TR70 Twin-Rotor Combine came out in 1975, most manufacturers have combines with rotors in place of conventional cylinders. However, makers have now returned to the market with conventional models alongside their rotary line-up. A rotor is a long, longitudinally mounted rotating cylinder with plates similar to rub bars (except for in the above- mentioned Gleaner rotaries). There are usually two sieves, one above the other. The sieves are basically metal frames that have many rows of \\"fingers\\" set reasonably close together. The angle of the fingers is adjustable, to change the clearance and thereby control the size of material passing through. The top is set with more clearance than the bottom to allow a gradual cleaning action. Setting the concave clearance, fan speed, and sieve size is critical to ensure that the crop is threshed properly, the grain is clean of debris, and all of the grain entering the machine reaches the grain tank or 'hopper'. (Observe, for example, that when travelling uphill the fan speed must be reduced to account for the shallower gradient of the sieves.) Heavy material, e.g., unthreshed heads, fall off the front of the sieves and are returned to the concave for re-threshing. The straw walkers are located above the sieves, and also have holes in them. Any grain remaining attached to the straw is shaken off and falls onto the top sieve. When the straw reaches the end of the walkers it falls out the rear of the combine. It can then be baled for cattle bedding or spread by two rotating straw spreaders with rubber arms. Most modern combines are equipped with a straw spreader. Rather than immediately falling out the rear of the combine at the end of the walkers, there are models of combine harvesters from Eastern Europe and Russia (e.g. Agromash Yenisei 1200 1 HM, etc.) that have \\"straw catchers\\" at the end of the walkers, which temporarily hold the straw and then, once full, deposit it in a stack for easy gathering.  Conventional and rotary designs  McCormick 141 self- propelled Harvester-Thresher ca. 1954‚Äì57, shown in thresher mode, with harvester dismounted. Tr85 For some time, combine harvesters used the conventional design, which used a rotating cylinder at the front-end which knocked the seeds out of the heads, and then used the rest of the machine to separate the straw from the chaff, and the chaff from the grain. The TR70 from Sperry-New Holland was brought out in 1975 as the first rotary combine. Other manufacturers soon followed, International Harvester with their 'Axial Flow' in 1977 and Gleaner with their N6 in 1979. In the decades before the widespread adoption of the rotary combine in the late seventies, several inventors had pioneered designs which relied more on centrifugal force for grain separation and less on gravity alone. By the early eighties, most major manufacturers had settled on a \\"walkerless\\" design with much larger threshing cylinders to do most of the work. Advantages were faster grain harvesting and gentler treatment of fragile seeds, which were often cracked by the faster rotational speeds of conventional combine threshing cylinders. It was the disadvantages of the rotary combine (increased power requirements and over- pulverization of the straw by-product) which prompted a resurgence of conventional combines in the late nineties. Perhaps overlooked but nonetheless true, when the large engines that powered the rotary machines were employed in conventional machines, the two types of machines delivered similar production capacities. Also, research was beginning to show that incorporating above- ground crop residue (straw) into the soil is less useful for rebuilding soil fertility than previously believed. This meant that working pulverized straw into the soil became more of a hindrance than a benefit. An increase in feedlot beef production also created a higher demand for straw as fodder. Conventional combines, which use straw walkers, preserve the quality of straw and allow it to be baled and removed from the field. Instrumentation While the principles of basic threshing have changed little over the years, modern advancements in electronics and monitoring technology has continued to develop. Whereas older machines required the operator to rely on machine knowledge, frequent inspection and monitoring, and a keen ear to listen for subtle sound changes, newer machines have replaced many of those duties with instrumentation. =Shaft Monitors= Early on, simple magnetic pickups were used to monitor shaft rotation, and issue a warning when they deviated beyond preset limits. Temperature sensors can also give warning when bearings overheat due to lack of lubrication, sometimes leading to combine fires. =Loss Monitors= The job of monitoring how much grain is wasted by the thresher by being discharged with the chaff and straw used to require going behind the machine to check. Yield monitors work like a microphone, registering an electrical impulse caused by grains impacting a plate. A meter in the operator's cab displays the relative amount of grain loss proportional to speed. =Yield Monitoring= Measuring the amount of yield (bushels per acre or tonnes per hectare) has become increasingly important, particularly when real-time measurement can help determine which areas of a field are more or less productive. These variations can often be remediated with variable crop inputs. Yield is determined by measuring the amount of grain harvested in relation to the area covered. =Cameras= Cameras placed at strategic points on the machine can eliminate some of the guesswork for the operator. =Field Mapping= The advent of GPS and GIS technologies has made it possible to create field maps, which can assist in navigation, and in the preparation of yield maps, which show which parts of the field are more productive. Combine fires Grain combine fires are responsible for millions of dollars of loss each year. Fires usually start near the engine where dust and dry crop debris accumulate.UMN.edu Fires can also start when heat is introduced by bearings or gearboxes that have failed. From 1984 to 2000, 695 major grain combine fires were reported to U.S. local fire departments.UMN.edu Dragging chains to reduce static electricity was one method employed for preventing harvester fires, but it is not yet clear what if any role static electricity plays in causing harvester fires. The application of the appropriate synthetic greases will reduce the friction experienced at crucial points, i.e. chains, sprockets and gear boxes, compared to petroleum based lubricants. Engines with synthetic lubricants will also remain significantly cooler during operation.

Intended for service in Asia, Ocean and her sister ships were smaller and faster than the preceding s, but retained the same battery of four guns. She also carried thinner armour, but incorporated new Krupp steel, which was more effective than the Harvey armour used in the Majestics. Ocean was laid down in December 1897, launched in July 1898, and commissioned into the fleet in February 1900. She entered service with the Mediterranean Fleet until January 1901, when she was transferred to the China Station. Ocean was recalled from China in 1905 for service with the Channel Fleet after a period spent in reserve. From 1908 to early 1910, she was again assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. She was assigned to the Home Fleet in 1910 and saw little activity until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. At the start of the conflict, she was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron and was stationed in Ireland to support a cruiser squadron, but in October she was transferred to the East Indies Station to protect troopship convoys from India. In late 1914, Ocean participated in an attack on Basra before being transferred to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal. In February 1915, she was reassigned to the Dardanelles Campaign, and she took part in several attacks on the Ottoman fortifications defending the Dardanelles. On 18 March, she attempted to retrieve the battleship after the latter had been badly damaged by a mine in Erenk√∂y Bay, but had to abandon her salvage efforts due to heavy Turkish gunfire. She instead evacuated the surviving crew of Irresistible but struck a mine while making for the open sea. Badly damaged, her crew and the survivors of Irresistible were taken off by destroyers and Ocean left to sink in Morto Bay. Design Right elevation, deck plan and hull section as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1906 Ocean and her five sister ships were designed for service in East Asia, where the new rising power Japan was beginning to build a powerful navy, though this role was quickly made redundant by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902. The ships were designed to be smaller, lighter and faster than their predecessors, the s. Ocean was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 682 officers and ratings.Gardiner, p. 35 The Canopus-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple- expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time‚Äî from ‚Äîa full two knots faster than the Majestics.Gardiner, pp. 34, 35 Ocean had a main battery of four 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. To save weight, Ocean carried less armour than the Majestics‚Äî6 inches in the belt compared to ‚Äîalthough the change from Harvey armour in the Majestics to Krupp armour in Ocean meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Similarly, the other armour used to protect the ship could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. The main battery turrets were 10 in thick, atop 12-inch barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had 12 in thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Crew on the forward deck of a Canopus-class battleship, c. 1905 =Pre-World War I= HMS Ocean was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 15 December 1897, and was the first large armoured ship built at Devonport. She was launched on 5 July 1898, when she was christened by Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne in the presence of the Lords of the Admiralty. Completed in early 1900,Burt, p. 141 Ocean was commissioned at Devonport on 20 February 1900 by Captain Assheton Curzon-Howe for service with the Mediterranean Fleet. After a commissioning trial, she left Devonport on 13 March, and arrived at Malta later the same month, where she relieved . She served in the Mediterranean Fleet until January 1901, when she was transferred to the China Station in response to the Boxer Rebellion. Captain Richard William White was appointed in command in late August 1901. The following year she was reported to visit Port Lazaref (on the Korean peninsula) in October 1902, but she suffered damage in a typhoon, and then underwent a refit that lasted into 1903. When the United Kingdom and Japan ratified a treaty of alliance in 1905, the Royal Navy reduced its China Station presence and recalled all battleships from the station. As a result, Ocean and battleship left Hong Kong in company on 7 June 1905 and called at Singapore, where they rendezvoused with Oceans sister ships and . The four battleships departed Singapore on 20 June 1905 and steamed home together, arriving at Plymouth on 2 August 1905.Burt, p. 97 Ocean went into reserve at Chatham Dockyard.Ocean returned to full commission on 2 January 1906 to serve in the Channel Fleet, undergoing refits at Chatham from January‚ÄìMarch 1907 and from April‚ÄìJune 1908. On 2 June 1908, Ocean recommissioned for duty in the Mediterranean Fleet, undergoing a refit at Malta in 1908‚Äì1909,Burt, p. 156 during which she received fire control equipment.Gardiner & Gray, p. 8 Ocean transferred to the 4th Division of the new Home Fleet on 16 February 1910. She underwent refits at Chatham in 1910 and 1911‚Äì1912. In 1913‚Äì1914, she was stationed at Pembroke Dock, Wales, as part of the 3rd Fleet. =World War I= When the First World War broke out, Ocean was assigned to the 8th Battle Squadron, Channel Fleet, which she joined on 14 August 1914. She was detached to Queenstown, Ireland on 21 August to serve as guard ship there and to support a cruiser squadron operating in that area. In September 1914, she was ordered to relieve her sister ship Albion on the Cape Verde-Canary Islands Station, but while en route was diverted, first to Madiera and then to the Azores. The threat of the German East Asia Squadron and the independent cruiser , both of which were still at large, forced the Admiralty to redirect Ocean again, to the East Indies Station, to support cruisers on convoy duty in the Middle East. She was joined by the protected cruiser .Corbett (1920), pp. 84, 275, 309 From October‚ÄìDecember 1914, she served as flagship of the squadron in the Persian Gulf supporting operations against Basra. During this period, she escorted an Indian troop convoy to Bahrain in mid-October; the convoy had departed India on 16 October, and Ocean met the convoy at sea three days later to take over escort duties. After the convoy arrived on 3 November, Ocean began making preparations for the attack on Basra. Numerous small craft were armed to enter the Shatt al-Arab, the river leading to Basra. The first objective was to silence the old fortress at Al-Faw. On 5 November, Britain declared war on the Ottoman Empire, and the next morning, Ocean began the bombardment of Al-Faw. A landing party of 600 men, some of whom came from Oceans detachment of Royal Marines, stormed the fortress and captured it, having encountered no resistance.Corbett (1920), pp. 391‚Äì392 By December 1914, the ground forces Ocean supported had advanced to Al-Qurnah, at the juncture of the Euphrates and Tigris, allowing the Admiralty to recall Ocean for other purposes. She was accordingly stationed at Suez, Egypt, to assist in the defence of the Suez Canal, arriving there on 29 December. She anchored in the mouth of the southern end of the canal on 29 December and remained in that area until mid-January 1915, when she proceeded northward up the canal. On 3‚Äì4 February, she and the armed merchant cruiser Himalaya supported ground troops against an Ottoman attack on the canal in the vicinity of El Kubri. Later on the 3rd, after the Ottoman attack at El Kubri had been defeated, Ocean was sent to Deversoir to provide artillery support to the garrison there, but Ottoman attacks were insignificant. By the following day, the Ottoman assault had broken down completely.Corbett (1921), pp. 73, 77, 114, 116‚Äì118 Dardanelles campaign Map showing the Ottoman defences at the Dardanelles in 1915 Ocean transferred to the Dardanelles in late February 1915 to participate in the Dardanelles campaign. On 28 February, she took part in an attempt to suppress the Ottoman defences in the Dardanelles led by Admiral John de Robeck; the battleships Albion and led the operation, and were tasked with neutralizing the repaired fortress at Dardanus, while Ocean and supported them by engaging batteries of mobile field guns that had proved to be troublesome in previous attempts to neutralise the Ottoman defences. Ocean initially attempted to locate guns that had been active in the vicinity of Sedd el Bahr, before moving on with Majestic and coming under fire from several Ottoman batteries, including howitzers around Erenk√∂y. The British battleships eventually silenced the guns, but only temporarily; as soon as the ships moved on to other targets, the guns opened fire again. In the meantime, Albion and Triumph had approached Dardanus but they came under heavy fire from Ottoman guns on the European side of the straits, including the fortress at Erenk√∂y, and were forced to circle to avoid taking hits. Unable to engage Dardanus under these conditions, the ships instead opened fire on the guns at Erenk√∂y, which initially seemed to be effective, as the Ottoman fire slackened. Ocean and Majestic approached in an attempt to attack Dardanus, but they too came under renewed, furious fire from Erenk√∂y, and de Robeck again ordered a withdrawal. The only success came after the four battleships withdrew from the straits and a landing party from Triumph went ashore and disabled several light guns. The inability of the British and French fleets to neutralize the mobile field guns convinced the Allied command that the only way forward would be to make a major amphibious assault to clear the guns by land.Corbett (1921), pp. 166‚Äì169 She supported the landings at Sedd el Bahr on 4 March. These consisted of two companies of Marines, each landing at their beach. Ocean was tasked with supporting the northern company that landed at Sedd el Bahr. The southern group, tasked with capturing the coastal town of Kumkale, came under heavy fire as soon as they went ashore. The northern group encountered similar resistance, but Oceans gunners, more experienced from their operations of Basra the previous year, proved to be more effective than the other ships. Nevertheless, both companies were forced to withdraw, in large part because they were too small to break through the Ottoman defences.Corbett (1921), pp. 178‚Äì182 Another bombardment followed on 6 March; Ocean and the battleship were tasked with covering the powerful superdreadnought battleship while she engaged the Ottoman artillery batteries. After a day's bombardment, the British sent in minesweepers to try to clear the minefields blocking the strait, and Ocean, Majestic, and several destroyers were tasked with protecting them. Despite the heavy bombardment, the Ottoman defenses were largely intact, and even concerted firing from Ocean and other ships could not suppress the guns or their search lights. Early on 7 March, the British were forced to withdraw.Corbett (1921), pp. 189‚Äì191 On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet mounted a major attack on the Ottoman defences; Ocean joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and suppress the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans they were going to land troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship and then the battlecruiser began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage,Corbett (1921), pp. 213‚Äì218 and the battleship Bouvet struck a mine and exploded.Gardiner, p. 294 Later in the day, was disabled by a mine in Erenk√∂y Bay. Once it became apparent that the ship could not be saved, all of her surviving crew was taken off by destroyers except for her commanding officer and some volunteers trying to keep her afloat. Ocean was sent in to tow her out, but she ran aground during the attempt, and, after freeing herself, found it impossible to take Irresistible under tow because of the shallow water, Irresistibles increasing list, and heavy enemy fire. Ocean then took off the remaining members of Irresistibles crew and left the abandoned battleship to her fate; Irresistible sank unobserved by Allied forces, at around 19:30.Burt, p. 174Corbett (1921), pp. 220‚Äì222 While retiring with Irresistibles survivors aboard, Ocean herself was hit by an artillery shell fired by Seyit √áabuk, an Ottoman Army gunner and struck a drifting mine at around 19:00. Her starboard coal bunkers and passageways flooded, her steering jammed hard to port, and she took on a list of 15¬∞ to starboard. She came under fire from shore and began taking hits, which flooded her starboard engine room and prevented steering repairs. The destroyers , , and came alongside and took off her crew (and the survivors from Irresistible) at around 19:30. She then drifted into Morto Bay, still under fire, and sank there unobserved by Allied forces at about 22:30. When destroyer Jed entered the bay later that evening to sink Ocean and Irresistible with torpedoes so that they could not be captured by the Turks, the two battleships were nowhere to be found.Burt, pp. 156, 174Corbett (1921), p. 222 Notes References  * Further reading * Dittmar, F.

Together with the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem and the open mapping theorem, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the field. In its basic form, it asserts that for a family of continuous linear operators (and thus bounded operators) whose domain is a Banach space, pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm. The theorem was first published in 1927 by Stefan Banach and Hugo Steinhaus, but it was also proven independently by Hans Hahn.  Theorem  Theorem (Uniform Boundedness Principle). Let X be a Banach space and Y a normed vector space. Suppose that F is a collection of continuous linear operators from X to Y. If :\\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F} \\\\T(x)\\\\_Y < \\\\infty, for all x in X, then :\\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F,\\\\x\\\\=1} \\\\T(x)\\\\_Y=\\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F} \\\\T\\\\_{B(X,Y)} < \\\\infty. The completeness of X enables the following short proof, using the Baire category theorem. X_n = X eq \\\\varnothing. By the Baire category theorem for the non-empty complete metric space X, there exists m such that X_m has non-empty interior, i.e., there exist x_0 \\\\in X_m and such that :\\\\overline{B_\\\\varepsilon (x_0)} := \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X \\\\,:\\\\, \\\\x - x_0\\\\ \\\\le \\\\varepsilon \\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq X_m. Let u ‚àà X with and . One has that: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\T(u) \\\\_Y &= \\\\varepsilon^{-1} \\\\left \\\\T \\\\left( x_0 + \\\\varepsilon u \\\\right) - T(x_0) \\\\right \\\\_Y & [\\\\text{by linearity of } T ] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon^{-1} \\\\left ( \\\\left\\\\ T (x_0 + \\\\varepsilon u) \\\\right\\\\_Y + \\\\left\\\\ T (x_0) \\\\right\\\\_Y \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\leq \\\\varepsilon^{-1} (m + m). & [ \\\\text{since} \\\\ x_0 + \\\\varepsilon u, \\\\ x_0 \\\\in X_m ] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Taking the supremum over u in the unit ball of X and over T ‚àà F it follows that : \\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F} \\\\T\\\\_{B(X,Y)} \\\\leq 2 \\\\varepsilon^{-1} m < \\\\infty. }} There are also simple proofs not using the Baire theorem .  Corollaries  :Corollary. If a sequence of bounded operators (Tn) converges pointwise, that is, the limit of {Tn(x)} exists for all x in X, then these pointwise limits define a bounded operator T. Note it is not claimed above that Tn converges to T in operator norm, i.e. uniformly on bounded sets. (However, since {Tn} is bounded in operator norm, and the limit operator T is continuous, a standard \\"3-Œµ\\" estimate shows that Tn converges to T uniformly on compact sets.) :Corollary. Any weakly bounded subset S in a normed space Y is bounded.'' Indeed, the elements of S define a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear forms on the Banach space X = Y*, continuous dual of Y. By the uniform boundedness principle, the norms of elements of S, as functionals on X, that is, norms in the second dual Y**, are bounded. But for every s in S, the norm in the second dual coincides with the norm in Y, by a consequence of the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem. Let L(X, Y) denote the continuous operators from X to Y, with the operator norm. If the collection F is unbounded in L(X, Y), then by the uniform boundedness principle, we have: : R = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X \\\\ : \\\\ \\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F} \\\\Tx\\\\_Y = \\\\infty \\\\right \\\\\\\\} eq \\\\varnothing In fact, R is dense in X. The complement of R in X is the countable union of closed sets ‚à™Xn. By the argument used in proving the theorem, each Xn is nowhere dense, i.e. the subset ‚à™Xn is of first category. Therefore R is the complement of a subset of first category in a Baire space. By definition of a Baire space, such sets (called residual sets) are dense. Such reasoning leads to the principle of condensation of singularities, which can be formulated as follows: Theorem. Let X be a Banach space, {Yn} a sequence of normed vector spaces, and Fn an unbounded family in L(X, Yn). Then the set : R = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ x \\\\in X \\\\ : \\\\ \\\\forall n \\\\in \\\\mathbf{N} : \\\\sup olimits_{T \\\\in F_n} \\\\Tx\\\\_{Y_n} = \\\\infty \\\\right \\\\\\\\} is a residual set, and thus dense in X.  Example: pointwise convergence of Fourier series  Let \\\\mathbb{T} be the circle, and let C(\\\\mathbb{T}) be the Banach space of continuous functions on \\\\mathbb{T}, with the uniform norm. Using the uniform boundedness principle, one can show that there exists an element in C(\\\\mathbb{T}) for which the Fourier series does not converge pointwise. For f \\\\in C(\\\\mathbb{T}), its Fourier series is defined by :\\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}} \\\\hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} = \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Z}}\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\left (\\\\int_0 ^{2 \\\\pi} f(t) e^{-ikt} dt \\\\right) e^{ikx}, and the N-th symmetric partial sum is : S_N(f)(x) = \\\\sum_{k=-N}^N \\\\hat{f}(k) e^{ikx} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0 ^{2 \\\\pi} f(t) D_N(x - t) \\\\, dt, where DN is the N-th Dirichlet kernel. Fix x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T} and consider the convergence of {SN(f)(x)}. The functional \\\\varphi_{N,x}: C(\\\\mathbb{T})\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} defined by :\\\\varphi_{N, x} (f) = S_N(f)(x), \\\\qquad f \\\\in C(\\\\mathbb{T}), is bounded. The norm of œÜN,x, in the dual of C(\\\\mathbb{T}), is the norm of the signed measure (2œÄ)‚àí1DN(x‚àít) dt, namely : \\\\left \\\\ \\\\varphi_{N,x} \\\\right \\\\ = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0 ^{2 \\\\pi} \\\\left  D_N(x-t) \\\\right  \\\\, dt = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0 ^{2 \\\\pi} \\\\left  D_N(s) \\\\right  \\\\, ds = \\\\left \\\\ D_N \\\\right \\\\_{L^1(\\\\mathbb{T})}. One can verify that :\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_0 ^{2 \\\\pi}  D_N(t)  \\\\, dt \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\frac{\\\\left \\\\sin\\\\left ( (N+\\\\tfrac{1}{2})t \\\\right )\\\\right}{t/2} \\\\, dt \\\\to \\\\infty. So the collection {œÜN,x} is unbounded in C(\\\\mathbb{T})^\\\\ast, the dual of C(\\\\mathbb{T}). Therefore, by the uniform boundedness principle, for any x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}, the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at x is dense in C(\\\\mathbb{T}). More can be concluded by applying the principle of condensation of singularities. Let {xm} be a dense sequence in \\\\mathbb{T}. Define œÜN,xm in the similar way as above. The principle of condensation of singularities then says that the set of continuous functions whose Fourier series diverges at each xm is dense in C(\\\\mathbb{T}) (however, the Fourier series of a continuous function f converges to f(x) for almost every x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}, by Carleson's theorem).  Generalisations  The least restrictive setting for the uniform boundedness principle is a barrelled space where the following generalised version of the theorem holds : :Theorem. Given a barrelled space X and a locally convex space Y, then any family of pointwise bounded continuous linear mappings from X to Y is equicontinuous (even uniformly equicontinuous). Alternatively, the statement also holds whenever X is a Baire space and Y is a locally convex space. proves a weaker form of this theorem with Fr√©chet spaces rather than the usual Banach spaces. Specifically, :Theorem. Let X be a Fr√©chet space, Y a normed space, and H a set of continuous linear mappings of X into Y. If for every x in X :\\\\sup olimits_{u\\\\in H}\\\\u(x)\\\\<\\\\infty, then the family H is equicontinuous.

The station is a terminus and located at the northern end of central Milan. It was officially inaugurated in 1931 to replace the old central station (built 1864), which was a transit station but with a limited number of tracks and space, so could not handle the increased traffic caused by the opening of the Simplon tunnel in 1906. Milano Centrale has high-speed connections to Turin in the west, Venice via Verona in the east and on the north-south mainline to Bologna, Rome, Naples and Salerno. The Simplon and Gotthard railway lines connect Milano Centrale to Bern and Geneva via Domodossola and Z√ºrich via Chiasso in Switzerland. Destinations of inter-city and regional railways radiate from Milano Centrale to Ventimiglia (border of France), Genova, Turin, Domodossola (border of Swiss Canton of Valais/Wallis), Tirano (border of Swiss Canton of Graub√ºnden/Grisons), Bergamo, Verona, Mantova, Bologna and La Spezia. The Milan suburban railway service, however, does not use Milano Centrale but the other mainline stations: Porta Garibaldi (northwest), Cadorna (west) and Rogoredo (east). Aldo Rossi declared in an interview of February 1995 to Cecilia Bolognesi Aldo Rossi, Luoghi Urbani, Unicopli 1999, p. 31: \\"They told me that when Frank Lloyd Wright came to Milan, and he came only once, he was really impressed by it and said it was the most beautiful station in the world. For me it is also more beautiful than Grand Central Station in New York. I know few stations like this one\\". History The first Milano Centrale station opened in 1864 in the area now occupied by the Piazza della Repubblica, south of the modern station.see also Milano Repubblica railway station It was designed by French architect Louis-Jules Bouchot (1817‚Äì1907) and its architectural style was reminiscent of Parisian buildings of that period. The station was designed to replace Porta Tosa station (opened in 1846 as the terminus of the line to Treviglio and eventually Venice) and Porta Nuova station (opened in 1850 as the second terminus on the line to Monza, which was eventually extended to Chiasso) and was interconnected with all lines, either existing or under construction, surrounding Milan. It remained in operation until 30 June 1931, when the current station was opened. There is now no trace of the old station left. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy laid the cornerstone of the new station on April 28, 1906, before a blueprint for the station had even been chosen. The last, real, contest for its construction was won in 1912 by architect Ulisse Stacchini, whose design was modeled after Washington Union Station in Washington, DC, and the construction of the new station began. The purported style was an eclectic mix called \\"Assyrian- Lombard.\\"Daverio, Philippe. Lombardy. Milan: RCS Libri, 2015. p 47. Due to the Italian economic crisis during World War I, construction proceeded very slowly, and the project, rather simple at the beginning, kept changing and became more and more complex and majestic. This happened especially when Benito Mussolini became Prime Minister, and wanted the station to represent the power of the Fascist regime. The major changes were the new platform types and the introduction of the great steel canopies by Alberto Fava; long and covering an area of . Construction resumed in 1925 and on July 1, 1931, the station was officially opened in the presence of Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano.The New Central Station at Milan Railway Gazette 11 September 1931 pages 331-341 The station played a vital role during the Holocaust in Italy, when Jewish inmates from the San Vittore Prison, previously captured in northern Italy, would be taken to a secret track, Binario 21, underneath the station to be deported to extermination camps. Altogether, 15 deportation trains with 1,200 prisoners left the station from Binario 21. A Memoriale della Shoah was opened at the former platform in January 2013 to commemorate these events. Its fa√ßade is wide and its vault is high, a record when it was built. It has 24 platforms. Each day about 330,000 passengers use the station, totaling about 120 million per year. The station has no definite architectural style, but is a blend of many different styles, especially Liberty and Art Deco, but not limited to those. It is adorned with numerous sculptures. \\"The 'incongruous envelope of stone' (Attilio Pracchi) of this gigantic and monumental building dominates Piazza Duca d'Aosta.\\"Touring Club Guida di Milano, p. 471 On September 25, 2006, officials announced a ‚Ç¨100 million project, already in progress, to refurbish the station. Of the total cost, ‚Ç¨20 million has been allocated to restore \\"certain areas of high artistic value\\" while the remaining ‚Ç¨80 million will be used for more general improvements to the station to make it more functional with the current railway services. The project includes moving the ticket office and installing new elevators and escalators for increased accessibility. There remain unrestored and inaccessible areas to the public within the station, including a waiting room with swastikas on the floor designed to receive Hitler.

Adams is known (especially in Phrygian Gates) for the concept of \\"gating,\\" which is the process of suddenly changing certain pitches in a harmony, often based on different modes.John Adams, Rebecca Jemian and Anne Marie de Zeeuw, \\"An Interview with John Adams,\\" Perspectives of New Music 34, no. 2 (Summer 1996): 104, https://www.jstor.org/stable/833472 (accessed 7 October 2012). Example 1. Harmonic transformations in the first section As seen in Example 1, the initial pitch collection of D, E, and A, as scored in the clarinets and optional synthesizers, slowly transforms over time by adding pitches. This process is a concept of changing harmony, which Adams describes as \\"bring[ing] in a new key area almost on the sly, stretching the ambiguity out over such a length of time that the listener would hardly notice that a change had taken place.\\"Heisinger, \\"American Minimalism,\\" 434-435. By measure 52, the aggregate of pitches suddenly shifts as the E major chord is replaced by a B-flat major chord. Meanwhile, the original pitch collection continues to exist as an unchanging force.John Adams, \\"Short Ride in a Fast Machine,\\" in Norton Anthology of Western Music, ed. J. Peter Burkholder and Claude V. Palisca (New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 2010), 3:777. This process is the main harmonic device that Adams employs, as the next section shifts pitch collections more rapidly for contrast, while other sections return to the pace of the first section.Adams, \\"Short Ride,\\" 3:778. =Rhythmic devices= In its rhythm, this work adheres to the main precepts of minimalism, one of which is the use of repeated material, generally in the form of ostinati. Minimalism also favours a strong sense of pulse, which Adams emphasizes strongly in Short Ride in a Fast Machine in his scoring of the wood block. Adams claims that \\"I need to experience that fundamental tick\\" in his work.John Adams et al., \\"Interview,\\" 94. Throughout the course of the work, Adams experiments with the idea of rhythmic dissonance as material begins to appear, initially in the trumpets, and generates a new sense of pulse.Stanley V. Kleppinger, \\"Metrical Issues in John Adams's 'Short Ride in a Fast Machine,'\\" Indiana Theory Review 22, no. 1 (Spring 2001): 66. As shown below, the manifestation of rhythmic dissonance is akin to Adams's method of creating harmonic dissonance as he adds conflicting rhythms to disrupt the metronomic stability of the wood block. Adams himself admits that he seeks to \\"enrich the experience of perceiving the way that time is divided\\" within his works. Later in the work, (see Example 5) Adams introduces a simple polyrhythm as a means of initiating a new section that contrasts the rhythmic dissonance of the first section. Example 2. Initial rhythmic dissonance Example 3. Development of rhythmic dissonance Example 4. Result of rhythmic dissonance Example 5. Polyrhythmic dissonance at a later section =Formal devices= The idea of formal closure and rhetorical devices in a sense of common practice is skewed in the works of John Adams, especially in Short Ride in a Fast Machine. While works of common practice organize material by phrases which are separated by cadential material, this work is in a state of perpetual motion as the additive element of harmonic and rhythmic material drives the work forward. The \\"gating\\" concept gives the overall work a sense of sectional design, but the indication of termination through cadence is something that is absent from the work until the very end, which emulates a ii-V-I cadence.Catherine Pellegrino, \\"Aspects of Closure,\\" 169. Final cadence In terms of defining the sections of the work, the wood block is scored in a way that creates a four- part form. The first and third parts of the work have a high wood block present in the scoring, which is contrasted by a low wood block in the second part, while the final part features the absence of wood block.Adams, \\"Short Ride,\\" 3:777-778.

Her keel was laid in November 1942, and she was commissioned on 30 June 1945. Construction and design The Colossus-class was a class of relatively small aircraft carriers which were designed to be built quickly to meet the Royal Navy's requirements for more carriers to allow it to fight a global war. In order to allow speedy build, they were designed to mercantile rather than navy hull standards, while armour protection and long-range anti aircraft guns were not fitted. Sixteen ships were ordered by the end of 1942, but the last six were completed to a modified design as the Majestic-class. The ships were between and long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars. Beam was and draught was at deep load. Displacement was standard and deep load. Four Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam to two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines which in turn drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ships had a range of at a speed of . The flight deck was long and wide, while the hangar was long and wide with a clear overhead height of . While designed to carry 24 aircraft in 1942, by the time that they became operational, the ships were accommodating 37 aircraft. Ocean was fitted with a close-in anti-aircraft armament of six quadruple and seven single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom autocannon and twelve single Bofors 40 mm guns. The ship had a crew of 1300 officers and ratings. Ocean was laid down at Alexander Stephen and Sons Glasgow shipyard on 8 November 1942 and was launched on 8 July 1944. In March 1944, a proposal was made by the Australian government to purchase a light fleet carrier, specifically Ocean. The application was rejected in early June 1945, and the carrier entered Royal Navy service. The ship was commissioned on 8 August 1945. In total, the ship required 20772 man-months to build. Service The first carrier landing and take-off of a jet aircraft in 1945 Following commissioning, Ocean was sent to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for modification to operate night fighters - changes included revised radar (with American SM-1 radar replacing the British Type 277 height-finding radar) and improved direction-finding equipment. On completion of these changes in November 1945, Ocean was based at Rosyth for flying trials, with the first trials of the de Havilland Sea Hornet twin- engine fighter and the last carrier operations of the Fairey Swordfish biplane torpedo bomber. On 3 December 1945, a Sea Vampire flown by Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown made the first ever carrier landing of a purely jet-powered aircraft onto Ocean (although earlier that year a composite jet and piston engined Ryan FR-1 Fireball had made a carrier landing under jet power after its radial engine failed.)\\"First Jet Landing.\\" Naval Aviation News, United States Navy, March 1946, p. 6. The first jet aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier was the unconventional composite propeller-jet Ryan FR Fireball, but it was designed to utilise its piston engine during takeoff and landing. On 6 November 1945, the piston engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach and the pilot started the jet engine and landed, thereby performing the first jet-powered carrier landing, albeit unintentionally. In December 1945, Ocean transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet, with an air group consisting of the Supermarine Seafire- equipped 805 Naval Air Squadron and 816 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Fairey Firefly night fighters. She disembarked her air group at Malta in June 1946 to allow her to be used as a troopship to carry troops to Singapore. In October 1946 she provided fire-fighting and medical support to the two destroyers and when they struck mines in the Corfu Channel incident. In May 1948, she formed part of the task force supporting the withdrawal of British forces withdrew from Palestine, providing air cover after RAF bases in Palestine had been evacuated. Ocean twice deployed to Korea, firstly from May to October 1952 and then from May to November 1953. In August 1952 a formation of Hawker Sea Fury aircraft from the carrier engaged North Korean MiG-15 jets in air combat, shooting one down. In August 1954 she joined the Home Fleet's training squadron but saw an active role in the Suez crisis. In the first ever large-scale helicopter borne assault, Westland Whirlwind and Bristol Sycamore helicopters from Ocean and HMS Theseus landed 425 men of 45 Commando and 23 tons of stores into Port Said in 90 minutes. After Suez, the ship did not see much more active service. In September 1957, the Soviet Union protested when accompanied Ocean on a visit to Helsinki. She went into extended reserve in 1958 and was scrapped in 1962 at Faslane. In his book on the Hungarian Revolution, Peter Fryer briefly refers to the \\"arrest of twelve British seamen in the aircraft carrier Ocean, following unlawful meetings\\" in October 1956.

She was designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of Commander UK Amphibious Force and Commander UK Landing Force. She was constructed in the mid-1990s by Kvaerner Govan on the River Clyde and fitted out by VSEL at Barrow-in-Furness prior to trials and subsequent acceptance in service. Ocean was commissioned in September 1998 at her home port HMNB Devonport, Plymouth. In December 2017, the Brazilian Navy confirmed the purchase of the ship for ¬£84.6 million. Following her decommissioning from Royal Navy service on 27 March 2018, she arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 25 August 2018, with the intention of being commissioned as Atl√¢ntico and fully operational by 2020. Background An invitation to tender for a new helicopter carrier was issued in February 1992. In February 1993 The Times reported that the carrier faced cancellation due to budgetary constraints. However, at approximately the same time, British forces were engaged in operations in the Balkans, which saw the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's aviation training ship RFA Argus pressed into service as an amphibious transport ship. Arguss accommodation and facilities proved inadequate for the needs of a large Embarked Military Force (EMF), which emphasised the need for a purpose-built platform. On 29 March 1993, the defence procurement minister announced that development of the new Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) was proceeding. Two shipbuilders tendered for the contract ‚Äì Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd (VSEL) and Swan Hunter. On 11 May 1993, the government announced that VSEL had won the contract. The build was to commercial standards, reducing costs significantly and leading to a construction spend of ¬£154 million (¬£ in ),, comparable to that of a Type 23 frigate. VSEL, a warship manufacturer, sub- contracted the build phase to the commercial Kv√¶rner yard in Govan, Glasgow. That VSEL's bid was ¬£71 million lower than Swan Hunter's was the source of political controversy and led to a National Audit Office investigation to determine whether the competition was fair. The report, published on 29 July 1993, stated that, although VSEL did subsidise its bid, the MoD was right to award the contract to VSEL because the subsidy was much smaller than the difference between the two bids; VSEL's bid was ¬£139.5 million compared to Swan Hunter's ¬£210.6 million. The Times also suggested that the subsidy was as little as ¬£10 million. In anticipation of the report, the Financial Times described the different philosophies adopted by the two bidders; while Swan Hunter viewed the ship as entirely military, \\"VSEL thought the design was basically a merchant ship with military hardware bolted on.\\" VSEL's decision to sub-contract the build phase took advantage of lower overheads at a civilian yard as well as efficiency drives by its parent, Kv√¶rner. Launched on 11 October 1995, she was subsequently named at Barrow by Her Majesty the Queen on 20 February 1998, prior to delivery to Devonport. In her sea trial, she reached a top speed of ; however, her usual top speed is . Role Ocean was designed to provide the amphibious assault capabilities last offered by and . She can deploy an Embarked Military Force (EMF) of a Royal Marines Commando Group from 3 Commando Brigade supported by aircraft and landing craft. The ship's company included 9 Assault Squadron (9 ASRM) from 1 Assault Group Royal Marines whose primary role is as an Amphibious Assault Squadron. Secondary tasks include boarding parties, beach reconnaissance and providing amphibious knowledge to the ships Command. Besides these roles they have responsibilities within the ship which include firefighting, watchkeeping and security. 9 ASRM is divided into a HQ unit, Landing Craft Troop, Signals detachment, Vehicle Deck Party and Assault Supply Team.RN Publication 15/370 HMS Ocean was also capable of limited anti-submarine warfare activities, supporting afloat training and acting as a base facility for other embarked forces including counter-terrorism units. The ship was capable of carrying four to six Apache AH1 helicopters operated by the Army Air Corps, as well as helicopters of the Royal Air Force, including the larger twin-rotor Chinook. Prior to their retirement, Ocean could transport up to fifteen fixed-wing Harrier aircraft of Joint Force Harrier in the ferry role, but was unable to operate as a fixed- wing aircraft carrier because she lacked the ski jump that is needed to launch a fully loaded Harrier. For the 2012 London Olympics, she carried an air arm of eight Army Air Corps and Fleet Air Arm Super Lynx helicopters, four from each service, to deploy special forces and conduct other missions in a security role. Four Landing Craft Vehicle and Personnel (LCVPs) were permanently embarked and manned by 9 Assault Squadron Royal Marines. Operational history =1998‚Äì2000= US Marines ride the forward aircraft lift into Oceans hangar deck during an exercise in 1999. Weeks after being commissioned, Ocean was undertaking the warm water element of her first-of- class trials, when she was deployed on short notice to the coasts of Honduras and Nicaragua to provide humanitarian assistance in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch. In early 1999, Ocean was scheduled to take part in an exercise in the Atlantic, but was diverted to the Mediterranean in readiness for possible deployment to Kosovo. During 2000, Ocean supported Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone, joining in aiding the suppression of rebel activity with her own embarked force, and providing support facilities for the Spearhead battalion ashore. =2001‚Äì2010= On 17 February 2002, whilst under command of Captain Adrian Johns, a unit of Royal Marines from Ocean accidentally landed on the San Felipe beach in the Spanish town of La Linea instead of Gibraltar, causing a minor diplomatic incident as various media outlets labelled the mistake as an \\"invasion\\". Ocean was part of a large Royal Navy task force deployed for Operation Telic, the UK contribution to the 2003 Iraq War, for which she was awarded a new battle honour \\"Al Faw 2003\\". In the helicopter assault role she was accompanied by . She was awarded the Freedom of the City of Sunderland on 26 July 2004.https://www.sunderland.gov.uk/media/19477/Freedom- Recipients/pdf/Freedom_Recipients.pdf?m=636425412147300000 In the summer of 2006, under the command of Captain Christopher Clayton, the ship was deployed as part of the task force involved in the Aurora exercises on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Clayton was later succeeded by Captain Tony Johnstone-Burt. In 2007, Ocean began her first long refit period. This was carried out by Devonport Management Limited at their Devonport Royal Dockyard facility and lasted around 12 months. Following this major period of maintenance and upgrading work, Ocean sailed from Plymouth on Wednesday 24 September 2008 to start sea trials. As part of that upgrade, a PyTEC pyrolysising waste recycling unit was fitted. On 18 February 2009, Ocean sailed from Devonport as part of the Taurus 09 deployment. She was joined on this deployment by the landing platform dock , as the flagship of the group, which included Type 23 Frigates and and four ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. This exercise was filmed for the second series of the Channel 5 documentary Warship. In June 2009, Ocean took part in exercise Bersama Shield with and off the Malay Peninsula. During the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj√∂kull eruption, Prime Minister Gordon Brown assigned Ocean and other units to rescue stranded travellers and army personnel across the English Channel in Operation Cunningham. In 2010, the ship was sent on a multi-purpose deployment. This started with exercise Auriga on the eastern coast of the USA. She then moved to Brazil to conduct an exercise with the Brazilian marines; whilst there a defence co-operation agreement was signed on board. She then crossed the Atlantic to Nigeria to participate in the \\"Nigeria at 50\\" presidential fleet review and provide training to the Nigerian navy as part of the African partnership programme. She returned to Devonport in November. =2011‚Äì2018= HMS Ocean deployed for the 2012 Olympic Games In April 2011, while under command of Captain Keith Blount, the ship took part in the COUGAR 11 deployment under the ultimate command of Commander Amphibious Task Group. During this deployment, she took part in Exercise Cypriot Lion. In May 2011, she was detached from CATG's COUGAR 11 deployment and sent with embarked Apaches to aid operations in Libya along with the attack helicopters aboard the French amphibious assault ship Tonnerre. This was the first time that Apache helicopters were sent directly into action from a Royal Navy ship. Her initial complement of three Apaches was bolstered by a fourth soon after, and later a fifth. The deployment included a large medical team, a sign of the ship's flexibility. Apache and Chinook training on Ocean in November 2014 following her refit On 4 May 2012, she moored at Greenwich to prepare for her role of providing logistics support, accommodation and a helicopter landing site during the London 2012 Olympic Games. From 24 to 28 May 2012, she visited Sunderland, her affiliated port, and made other port calls before returning to London on 13 July. After Olympic duty, Ocean returned to her home port of HMNB Devonport for a scheduled period of maintenance. The LPH role was provided by until 2014. On 22 July 2014, HMS Ocean took over the helicopter carrier role again, after her 15-month, ¬£65 million refit, replacing , which then returned to her home port Portsmouth for the last time, being decommissioned on 28 August 2014. As part of the Response Force Task Group COUGAR 14 deployment, Ocean participated in exercises off Albania and France. In April 2015 Ocean took part in Exercise Joint Warrior 15-1 around the coast of Scotland, with Wildcat helicopters landing on her for the first time. She then stopped again in Sunderland where the ship's company exercised their right to the freedom of the city, with more than 300 officers and ratings parading through the city centre. Ocean became the Royal Navy Fleet Flagship in June 2015. In December 2015, she returned to port after Exercise COUGAR 15, an amphibious warfare exercise in the Mediterranean with the French Navy. In September 2016, Ocean left Devonport for the inaugural Joint Expeditionary Force (Maritime) (JEF(M)) Task Group deployment which is the successor to the annual Cougar deployments. The bulk of this deployment took place East of Suez and demonstrated the Uk's ongoing ability to deploy highly effective and combat capable maritime forces anywhere in the world.https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest- activity/news/2016/september/20/160920-ocean-deploys The core task group included the LSD RFA Mount's Bay, MOD strategic Ro-Ro vessel MV Eddystone and HMS Bulwark. Elements of the Royal Marines lead Commando Unit, based around 42 Commando, were spread across the force. Frigates and Destroyers from the Royal Navy and French Navy joined throughout the deployment. https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest- activity/news/2016/september/20/160920-ocean-deploys On the 60th anniversary of Op Musketeer, Ocean became the flagship of COMATG. This marked the end of the JEF(M) deployment. On 25 November, the ship rendezvoused with . COMATG assumed command of the U.S. Task Force 50,https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news- and-latest-activity/news/2016/november/26/161126-royal-navy-leads-us-task- force-50 becoming Commander, Task Force 50 (CTF 50). Due to the U.S. Navy gap in carrier coverage in the Middle East, this was the first time a Royal Navy vessel had commanded the US formation responsible for maritime war fighting in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulfs of Aden and Oman and the Indian Ocean. On 24th March Ocean returned to Devonport. During the deployment she steamed 23,000 miles, visited 11 countries, provided a platform for six British ambassadors and High Commissioners and was home to up to 1150 service personnel. At the end of August 2017, Ocean left Devonport for her final deployment, scheduled to take over as Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 flagship in the Mediterranean. Before she could relieve HMS Duncan with SNMG2, Ocean was redeployed to assist in disaster relief efforts following Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, and then the subsequent Hurricane Maria. Ocean was decommissioned on 27 March 2018 at HMNB Devonport, with Queen Elizabeth II attending the ceremony. Sale to Brazil Brazil, seeking a replacement for their navy's outgoing flagship, NAe S√£o Paulo, began discussions with the United Kingdom in 2017 to negotiate the purchase of Ocean, following her decommission from service in 2018. An agreement was struck and after being transferred to Brazil, ex-Ocean was commissioned as Atl√¢ntico in June 2018.

They originate from the early inhabitants of the central Nile valley, believed to be one of the earliest cradles of civilization.Charles Keith Maisels (1993). The Near East: Archaeology in the \\"Cradle of Civilization. Routledge. . They speak Nubian languages, part of the Northern Eastern Sudanic languages. Early Neolithic settlements have been found in the central Nubian region dating back to 7000 BC, with Wadi Halfa believed to be the oldest settlement in the central Nile valley. Parts of Nubia, particularly Lower Nubia, were at times a part of ancient Pharaonic Egypt and at other times a rival state representing parts of Mero√´ or the Kingdom of Kush. By the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (744 BC‚Äì656 BC), all of Nubia was united with Egypt, extending down to what is now Khartoum. However, In 656 BC the native Twenty-sixth Dynasty regained control of Egypt. As warriors, the ancient Nubians were famous for their skill and precision with the bow and arrow. In the Middle Ages, the Nubians converted to Christianity and established three kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, Makuria in the center, and Alodia in the south. Today, Nubians in Egypt primarily live in southern Egypt, especially in Kom Ombo and Nasr al-nuba north of Aswan, and large cities such as Cairo, while Sudanese Nubians live in northern Sudan, particularly in the region between the city of Wadi Halfa on the Egypt‚ÄìSudan border and al Dabbah.Some Nubians migrated to Khashm el Girba and New Halfa. Additionally, several groups known as the Hill Nubians live in the northern Nuba Mountains in South Kordofan state, Sudan. The main Nubian groups from north to south are the Kenzi, Faadicha (Halfawi), Sukkot, Mahas, and Danagla. Etymology Throughout history various parts of Nubia were known by different names, including \\"Land of the Bow\\", tÍú£ n·∏•sj, jÍú£m \\"Kerma\\", jr·πØt, s·πØjw, wÍú£wÍú£t, Meroitic: akin(e) ¬´Lower \\"Nubia\\"¬ª and qes(a), qos(a) \\"Kush\\", and Greek Aethiopia. The origin of the names Nubia and Nubian are contested. What is more certain is that they ultimately denote geographical provenance rather than ethnic origin. Based on cultural traits, many scholars believe Nubia is derived from the \\"gold\\". The Roman Empire used the term \\"Nubia\\" to describe the area of Upper Egypt and northern Sudan. Another etymology traces the toponym to a distinct group of people, the Noubai, who in more recent times inhabited the area that would become known as Nubia. The derivation of the term \\"Nubian\\" has also been associated with the Greek historian Strabo, who referred to the Nubas people. History Kushite king Senkamanisken c. 643‚Äì623 BC. Kerma Museum Marble portrait of a Nubia denizen c. 120‚Äì100 BC The prehistory of Nubia dates to the Paleolithic around 300,000 years ago. By about 6000 BC, peoples in the region had developed an agricultural economy. They began using a system of writing relatively late in their history, when they adopted the Egyptian hieroglyphic system. Ancient history in Nubia is categorized according to the following periods: A-Group culture (3700‚Äì2800 BC), C-Group culture (2300‚Äì1600), Kerma culture (2500‚Äì1500), Nubian contemporaries of the New Kingdom (1550‚Äì1069), the Twenty-fifth Dynasty (1000‚Äì653), Napata (1000‚Äì275), Mero√´ (275 BC‚Äì300/350 AD), Makuria (340‚Äì1317), Nobatia (350‚Äì650), and Alodia (600s‚Äì1504). The linguistic affinities of early Nubian cultures are uncertain. Some research has suggested that the early inhabitants of the Nubia region, during the C-Group and Kerma cultures were speakers of languages belonging to the Berber and Cushitic branches respectively, of the Afroasiatic family. More recent research instead suggests that the people of the Kerma culture spoke Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch, and that the peoples of the C-Group culture to their north spoke Cushitic languages. They were succeeded by the first Nubian language speakers, whose tongues belonged to another branch of Eastern Sudanic languages within the Nilo-Saharan phylum. A 4th-century victory stela commemorative of Axumite king Ezana contains inscriptions describing two distinct population groups dwelling in ancient Nubia: a \\"red\\" population and a \\"black\\" population. Although Egypt and Nubia have a shared pre-dynastic and pharaonic history, the two histories diverge with the fall of Ancient Egypt and the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. At this point, the area of land between the 1st and the 6th cataract of the Nile became known as Nubia. View of Nubians, 1683 (cropped) Egypt was conquered first by the Persians and named the Satrapy (Province) of Mudriya, and two centuries later by the Greeks and then the Romans. During the latter period, however, the Kushites formed the kingdom of Mero√´, which was ruled by a series of legendary Candaces or Queens. Mythically, the Candace of Mero√´ was able to intimidate Alexander the Great into retreat with a great army of elephants, while historical documents suggest that the Nubians defeated the Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar, resulting in a favorable peace treaty for Mero√´. The kingdom of Mero√´ also defeated the Persians, and later Christian Nubia defeated the invading Arab armies on three different occasions resulting in the 600 year peace treaty of Baqt, the longest lasting treaty in history.Jakobielski, S. 1992. Chapter 8: \\"Christian Nubia at the Height of its Civilization.\\" UNESCO General History of Africa, Volume III. University of California Press The fall of the kingdom of Christian Nubia occurred in the early 1500s resulting in full Islamization and reunification with Egypt under the Ottoman Empire, the Muhammad Ali dynasty, and British colonial rule. After the 1956 independence of Sudan from Egypt, Nubia and the Nubian people became divided between Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. A Nubian woman circa 1900 Modern Nubians speak Nubian languages, Eastern Sudanic languages that is part of the Nilo- Saharan family. The Old Nubian language is attested from the 8th century, and is the oldest recorded language of Africa outside of the Afroasiatic family. It was the language of the Noba nomads who occupied the Nile between the First and Third Cataracts and also of the Makorae nomads who occupied the land between the Third and Fourth Cataracts, following the collapse of the Kingdom of Kush sometime in the fourth century. The Makorae were a separate tribe who eventually conquered or inherited the lands of the Noba: they established a Byzantine-influenced state called the Makuria, which administered the Noba lands separately as the eparchy of Nobatia. Nobadia was converted to Miaphysitism by the Orthodox priest Julian and Longinus of Constantinople, and thereafter received its bishops from the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Nubia consisted of four regions with varied agriculture and landscapes. The Nile river and its valley were found in the north and central parts of Nubia, allowing farming using irrigation. The western Sudan had a mixture of peasant agriculture and nomadism. Eastern Sudan had primarily nomadism, with a few areas of irrigation and agriculture. Finally, there was the fertile pastoral region of the south, where Nubia's larger agricultural communities were located. Nubia was dominated by kings from clans that controlled the gold mines. Trade in exotic goods from other parts of Africa (ivory, animal skins) passed to Egypt through Nubia. Language Modern Nubians speak Nubian languages. They belong to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan phylum. But there is some uncertainty regarding the classification of the languages spoken in Nubia in antiquity. There is some evidence that Cushitic languages were spoken in parts of Lower (northern) Nubia, an ancient region which straddles present day Southern Egypt and Northern Sudan, and that Eastern Sudanic languages were spoken in Upper and Central Nubia, before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages even further north into Lower Nubia. Peter Behrens (1981) and Marianne Bechaus-Gerst (2000) suggest that the ancient peoples of the C-Group and Kerma civilizations spoke Afroasiatic languages of the Berber and Cushitic branches, respectively. They propose that the Nilo-Saharan Nobiin language today contains a number of key pastoralism related loanwords that are of Berber or proto-Highland East Cushitic origin, including the terms for sheep/goatskin, hen/cock, livestock enclosure, butter and milk. This in turn, is interpreted to suggest that the C-Group and Kerma populations, who inhabited the Nile Valley immediately before the arrival of the first Nubian speakers, spoke Afroasiatic languages. Claude Rilly (2010, 2016) and Julien Cooper (2017) on the other hand, suggest that the Kerma peoples (of Upper Nubia) spoke Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudanic branch, possibly ancestral to the later Meroitic language, which Rilly also suggests was Nilo-Saharan. Rilly also considers evidence of significant early Afro-Asiatic influence, especially Berber, on Nobiin to be weak (and where present, more likely due to borrowed loanwords than substrata), and considers evidence of substratal influence on Nobiin from an earlier now extinct Eastern Sudanic language to be stronger. Julien Cooper (2017) suggests that Nilo-Saharan languages of the Eastern Sudan branch were spoken by the people of Kerma, those further south along the Nile, to the west, and those of Sa√Ø (an island to the north of Kerma), but that Afro- Asiatic (most likely Cushitic) languages were spoken by other peoples in Lower Nubia (such as the Medjay and the C-Group culture) living in Nubian regions north of Sa√Ø toward Egypt and those southeast of the Nile in Punt in the Eastern dessert. Based partly on an analysis of the phonology of place names and personal names from the relevant regions preserved in ancient texts, he argues that the terms from \\"Kush\\" and \\"Irem\\" (ancient names for Kerma and the region south of it respectively) in Egyptian texts display traits typical of Eastern Sudanic languages, while those from further north (in Lower Nubia) and east are more typical of the Afro-Asiatic family, noting: \\"The Irem-list also provides a similar inventory to Kush, placing this firmly in an Eastern Sudanic zone. These Irem/Kush-lists are distinctive from the Wawat-, Medjay-, Punt-, and Wetenet-lists, which provide sounds typical to Afroasiatic languages.\\" It is also uncertain to which language family the ancient Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afroasiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she argues, are similar to those of the Afroasiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages.Rowan, Kirsty (2011). \\"Meroitic Consonant and Vowel Patterning\\". Lingua Aegytia, 19.Rowan, Kirsty (2006), \\"Meroitic - An Afroasiatic Language?\\" Working Papers in Linguistics 14:169‚Äì206. Claude Rilly proposes, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family. Modern Nubians Nubian wedding near Aswan The descendants of the ancient Nubians still inhabit the general area of what was ancient Nubia. They currently live in what is called Old Nubia, mainly located in modern Egypt and Sudan. Nubians have been resettled in large numbers (an estimated 50,000 people) away from Wadi Halfa North Sudan in to Khashm el Girba - Sudan and some moved to Southern Egypt since the 1960s, when the Aswan High Dam was built on the Nile, flooding ancestral lands. Some resettled Nubians continue working as farmers (sharecroppers) on resettlement farms whose landowners live elsewhere; most work in Egypt's and Sudanese cities. Whereas Arabic was once only learned by Nubian men who travelled for work, it is increasingly being learned by Nubian women who have access to school, radio and television. Nubian women are working outside the home in increasing numbers. In the 1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Egypt employed Nubian people as codetalkers. Culture Old Nubian manuscript Nubians have developed a common identity, which has been celebrated in poetry, novels, music and storytelling. Nubians in modern Sudan include the Danagla around Dongola Reach, the Mahas from the Third Cataract to Wadi Halfa, and the Sikurta around Aswan. These Nubians write using their own script. They also practice scarification: Mahas men and women have three scars on each cheek, while the Danaqla wear these scars on their temples. Younger generations appear to be abandoning this custom. Nubia's ancient cultural development was influenced by its geography. It is sometimes divided into Upper Nubia and Lower Nubia. Upper Nubia was where the ancient Kingdom of Napata (the Kush) was located. Lower Nubia has been called \\"the corridor to Africa\\", where there was contact and cultural exchange between Nubians, Egyptians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, and Arabs. Lower Nubia was also where the Kingdom of Meroe flourished. The languages spoken by modern Nubians are based on ancient Sudanic dialects. From north to south, they are: Kenuz, Fadicha (Matoki), Sukkot, Mahas, Danagla. Kerma, Nepata and Meroe were Nubia's largest population centres. The rich agricultural lands of Nubia supported these cities. Ancient Egyptian rulers sought control of Nubia's wealth, including gold, and the important trade routes within its territories. Nubia's trade links with Egypt led to Egypt's domination over Nubia during the New Kingdom period. The emergence of the Kingdom of Meroe in the 8th century BC led to Egypt being under the control of Nubian rulers for a century, although they preserved many Egyptian cultural traditions. Nubian kings were considered pious scholars and patrons of the arts, copying ancient Egyptian texts and even restoring some Egyptian cultural practices. After this, Egypt's influence declined greatly. Meroe became the centre of power for Nubia and cultural links with sub-Saharan Africa gained greater influence. =Religion= Today, Nubians practice Islam. To a certain degree, Nubian religious practices involve a syncretism of Islam and traditional folk beliefs. In ancient times, Nubians practiced a mixture of traditional religion and Egyptian religion. Prior to the spread of Islam, many Nubians practiced Christianity. Beginning in the eighth century, Islam arrived in Nubia, though Christians and Muslims (primarily Arab merchants at this period) lived peacefully together. Over time, the Nubians gradually converted to Islam, beginning with the Nubian elite. Islam was mainly spread via Sufi preachers that settled in Nubia in the late 14th century onwards. By the sixteenth century, most of the Nubians were Muslim. Ancient Nepata was an important religious centre in Nubia. It was the location of Gebel Barkal, a massive sandstone hill resembling a rearing cobra in the eyes of the ancient inhabitants. Egyptian priests declared it to be the home of the ancient deity Amun, further enhancing Nepata as an ancient religious site. This was the case for both Egyptians and Nubians. Egyptian and Nubian deities alike were worshipped in Nubia for 2,500 years, even while Nubia was under the control of the New Kingdom of Egypt. Nubian kings and queens were buried near Gebel Barkal, in pyramids as the Egyptian pharaohs were. Nubian pyramids were built at Gebel Barkal, at Nuri (across the Nile from Gebel Barkal), at El Kerru, and at Meroe, south of Gebel Barkal. Ornately decorated Nubian gate Architecture Modern Nubian architecture in Sudan is distinctive, and typically features a large courtyard surrounded by a high wall. A large, ornately decorated gate, preferably facing the Nile, dominates the property. Brightly colored stucco is often decorated with symbols connected with the family inside, or popular motifs such as geometric patterns, palm trees, or the evil eye that wards away bad luck. Nubians invented the Nubian vault, a type of curved surface forming a vaulted structure. Genetics =Y-DNA= Y-DNA analysis by Hassan et al. (2008) found that: * Around 44% of his Nubian samples from Sudan carried the haplogroup J * 23% belonged to the haplogroup E1b1b clade Both of these paternal lineages are also common among local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. The next most frequent haplogroups borne by Nubians were: * 10% Western European-linked haplogroup R1b * 10% Eurasian lineage haplogroup F * 8% ancient African haplogroup B * 5% Europe-associated haplogroup I =M-DNA= Regarding the M-DNA lineages, Hassan (2009) found that * approximately 83% of their Nubian samples carried various subclades of the Africa-centered macrohaplogroup L. Of these, the most frequent were: ** 30.8% L3 ** 20.6% L0a ** 10.3% L2 ** 6.9% L1 ** 6.9% L4 ** 6.9% L5 The remaining 17% of Nubians belonged to sublineages of Eurasian macrohaplogroups: * 6.8% haplogroup M (3.4% M/D, 3.4% M1) * 3.4% haplogroup N1a * 3.4% haplogroup R0 * 3.4% haplogroup R/haplogroup U6a1) However, nalysing a different group of Nubian individuals in Sudan, Non (2010) found a significantly higher frequency of around 48% of the Eurasian macrohaplogroups M and N: * 16% belonged to the M clade (around 9% to M1), with the rest bearing N subhaplogroups: * approximately 8% haplogroup R0 * 3% haplogroup T1a * 1% haplogroup H The remaining 52% of Nubians carried various Africa-centered macrohaplogroup L(xM,N) derivatives, with about 11% of individuals belonging to the L2a1 subclade. =Autosomal DNA= Dobon et al. (2015) found that modern Nubians are genetically closer to their Cushitic and Ethio-Semitic (Afro-Asiatic) neighbors (such as the Beja, Sudanese Arabs and Ethiopians) than to other Nilo-Saharan speakers. The study showed that populations from their \\"North- East cluster\\", which include Nubians, may be explained as a mixture of an ancestral North African population (similar to Copts) and an ancestral South- West population. Also, according to the authors, \\"Nubians were influenced by Arabs as a direct result of the penetration of large numbers of Arabs into the Nile Valley over long periods of time following the arrival of Islam around 651 A.D.\\" Hollfelder et al. (2017) analysed various populations in Sudan and observed close autosomal affinities between their Nubian and Sudanese Arab samples. The authors concluded that the Nubians can be seen as a group with substantial genetic material relating to Nilotes that later received much gene-flow from Eurasians and East Africans. The strongest admixture came from Eurasian populations and was likely quite extensive: 39.41%-47.73%. Sirak et al. (2015) analysed the ancient DNA of a Christian-period inhabitant of Kulubnarti in northern Nubia near the Egyptian border. They found that this individual was most closely related to Middle Eastern populations. Further excavations of two Early Christian period (AD 550-800) cemeteries at Kulubnarti, one located on the mainland and the other on an island, revealed the existence of two ancestrally and socioeconomically distinct local populations. Preliminary results, including mitochondrial haplogroup analysis, suggests there may be substantial differences in the genetic composition between the two communities, with 70% of individuals from the island cemetery demonstrating African-based haplogroups (L2, L1, and L5), compared to only 36.4% of mainlanders, who instead show an increased prevalence of European and Near Eastern haplogroups (including K1, H, I5, and U1).

The owner of the property, who grants the lien, is referred to as the lienee\\"Lienee...One whose property is subject to a lien\\". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979). and the person who has the benefit of the lien is referred to as the lienor\\"Lienor... The person having or owning a lien; one who has a right of lien upon property of another\\". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979). or lien holder. The etymological root is Anglo-French lien, loyen \\"bond\\", \\"restraint\\", from Latin ligamen, from ligare \\"to bind\\". In the United States, the term lien generally refers to a wide range of encumbrances and would include other forms of mortgage or charge. In the US, a lien characteristically refers to nonpossessory security interests (see generally: Security interest‚Äîcategories). In other common-law countries, the term lien refers to a very specific type of security interest, being a passive right to retain (but not sell) property until the debt or other obligation is discharged. In contrast to the usage of the term in the US, in other countries it refers to a purely possessory form of security interest; indeed, when possession of the property is lost, the lien is released.Hatton v Car Maintenance' [1915] 1 Ch 621 However, common-law countries also recognize a slightly anomalous form of security interest called an \\"equitable lien\\" which arises in certain rare instances. Despite their differences in terminology and application, there are a number of similarities between liens in the US and elsewhere in the common-law world. United States Liens can be consensual or non-consensual (also termed voluntary or involuntary in different states). Consensual liens are imposed by a contract between the creditor and the debtor: *mortgage *chattel mortgage Nonconsensual liens typically arise by statute or by the operation of the common law. Those laws give a creditor the right to impose a lien on an item of real property or a chattel by the existence of the relationship of creditor and debtor. Those liens include *Tax liens, imposed to secure payment of a tax; *\\"Weed liens\\" and \\"Demolition liens\\", assessed by the government to rectify a property from being a nuisance and public hazard; *Homeowner Association (HOA) liens for unpaid assessments, fines, late charges, interest, costs, and attorney fees; *Attorney's liens, against funds and documents to secure payment of fees; *Mechanic's liens, which secure payment for work done on property or land; *Judgment liens, imposed to secure payment of a judgment; and *Maritime liens, imposed on ships by admiralty law. Liens are also \\"perfected\\" or \\"unperfected\\" (see perfection). Perfected liens are those liens for which a creditor has established a priority right in the encumbered property with respect to third party creditors. Perfection is generally accomplished by taking steps required by law to give third party creditors notice of the lien. The fact that an item of property is in the hands of the creditor usually constitutes perfection. Where the property remains in the hands of the debtor, some further step must be taken, like recording a notice of the security interest with the appropriate office. Perfecting a lien is an important part of the task of protecting the secured creditor's interest in the property. A perfected lien is valid against bona fide purchasers of property, and even against a trustee in bankruptcy; an unperfected lien may not be. =Equitable lien (U.S.)= In the United States, references to an \\"equitable lien\\" is a right, enforceable only in equity, to have a demand satisfied out of a particular fund or specific property without having possession of the fund or property. An equitable lien is actually a legal remedy, rather than a security interest created in contemplation of or in support of a transaction. In U.S. law, such liens characteristically arise in four circumstances:Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed.) # when an occupant of land, believing in good faith to be the owner of the land, makes improvements, repairs or other expenditure that permanently increases the land's value; # when one of two or more joint owners makes expenditures of the kind described above; # when a tenant for life completes permanent and beneficial improvements to the estate begun earlier by the testator; and # when land or other property is transferred subject to the payment of debts, legacies, portions or annuities to third persons. =Mover's lien= Movers are typically entitled to a mover's lien under UCC ¬ß 7-307/308, to withhold a customer's goods to secure payment. This is a possessory lien, and is the non-consensual type of lien (because it exists automatically under a statute instead of being affirmatively agreed upon). However, the concept of a mover's lien is often abused in a moving scam known as a hostage load, whereby the moving company will fraudulently extort money not owed by the customer by refusing to deliver the goods unless the customer pays money inflated beyond the contractual estimate. Because the customer has an interest in obtaining their own goods, they are under duress to pay the ransom. Hostage loads in at least the interstate context are illegal under 49 U.S.C. 13905. The FMCSA regulates the moving industry and sometimes takes enforcement action by fining and/or delicensure of offending moving companies. Moving companies that deliberately engage in hostage-loading may also be considered to be engaging in racketeering in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Disputes between legitimate lienholding of chattels vs. hostage-loading can sometimes be averted by the customer including an advanced (before-the-fact) consensual waiver of the mover's right to a lien in the written contract, obligating the moving company to deliver the goods with reasonable dispatch regardless of disputes over payment, and failure to do so would constitute conversion or trespass to chattels. Other common-law countries Outside of the US, a common-law lien may be defined in general terms as a passive right to retain a chattel (and, in certain cases, documentary intangibles and papers) conferred by law. Modern law has generally left the legal lien to cases where it has been historically established without any real effort being made to make it applicable to modern conditions. In Tappenden v Artus [1964] 2 QB 185 Diplock LJ referred to a lien as a \\"self help\\" remedy, like \\"other primitive remedies such as abatement of nuisance, self-defence or ejection of trespassers to land\\". Equitable liens are an unusual species of property right, usually considered sui generis. =Common- law lien= Common-law liens are divided into special liens and general liens. A special lien, the more common kind, requires a close connection between the property and the service rendered. A special lien can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well. A general lien affects all of the property of the lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor. A special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers.George Baker Ltd v Eynon [1974] 1 WLR 462 A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law,Thames Iron Works v Patent Derrick (1860) 1 J&H; 93 although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale,In the United Kingdom, see for example, Innkeepers Act 1878 and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract. The common-law liens are closely aligned to the so-called \\"common callings\\", but are not co-extensive with them. A common-law lien is a very limited type of security interest. Apart from the fact that it only amounts to a passive right to retain, a lien cannot be transferred;Legg v Evans (1840) 6 M&W; 36 it cannot be asserted by a third party to whom possession of the goods is given to perform the same services that the original party should have performed;Pennington v Reliance Motors Ltd [1923] 1 KB 127 and if the chattel is surrendered to the lienor, the lien entitlement is lost foreverHatton v Car Maintenance [1915] 1 Ch 621 (except for where the parties agree that the lien shall survive a temporary re- possession by the lienor). A lienee who sells the chattel unlawfully may be liable in conversion as well as surrendering the lien.Mulliner v Florence (1878) 3 QBD 484 =Equitable lien= In common-law countries, equitable liens give rise to unique and difficult issues. An equitable lien is a nonpossessory security right conferred by operation of law, which is similar in effect to an equitable charge. It differs from a charge in that it is non-consensual. It is conferred only in very limited circumstances, the most common (and least ambiguous) of which is in relation to the sale of land; an unpaid vendor has an equitable lien over the land for the purchase price, notwithstanding that the purchaser has gone into occupation of the property. It is seen as a counterweight to the equitable rule which confers a beneficial interest in the land on the purchaser once contracts are exchanged for purchase. It is a matter of conjecture how far equitable liens extend outside of the unpaid vendor's lien. Equitable liens have been held to exist in a number of cases involving choses in action, but not yet in relation to chattels.Transport and General Credit v Morgan [1939] 2 All ER 17 The Australian courts have been the most receptive towards equitable liens in relation to personal property (see Hewett v Court (1983) 57 ALJR 211, but a review of the cases still leaves a lack of clarity in relation to the principles upon which an equitable lien will be imposed. * In Re Stucley [1906] 1 Ch 67 a vendor of a reversionary interest in a trust fund, who sold the interest to the trustee, was held to have an equitable lien in the subject matter, although it was clearly personalty and not realty. * In Barker v Cox (1876) 4 Ch D 464 the purchaser of property which was included in a matrimonial settlement paid the price in advance to one of the trustees, and the purchaser was held to have an equitable lien in investments which the trustees subsequently acquired with the purchase price. * In Langen and Wing v Bell [1972] Ch 685 a director's service agreement required him to assign his shares in the company if he was terminated, and he was to receive a price calculated at a later date when the annual accounts were available; he was held to have an equitable lien over the transferred shares to secure the payment of the eventual purchase price. * In Lord Napier and Ettrick v Hunter [1993] 2 WLR 42 it was held that an indemnity insurer's subrogation rights in relation to funds improperly paid directly to the insured were subject to an equitable lien. But overall, there is still perceived to be a lack of central nexus.See Phillips J, \\"Equitable Liens‚ÄîA search for a unifying principle\\" in Palmer & McKendrick, Interests in Goods (2nd ed.) =Statutory liens and contractual liens= Although arguably not liens as such, two other forms of encumbrance are sometimes referred to as liens. Statutory liens Certain statutes provide for a passive right to retain property against its owner as security for obligations. For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom permits an airport to detain aircraft for unpaid airport charges and aviation fuel. Although this right has been treated as a lien under UK insolvency law,Bristol Airport v Powdrill [1990] Ch 744 it has been argued that such statutory rights are not in fact liens, but rights analogous to liens,Michael Bridge, Personal Property Law (2nd ed.) although an argument may be made that this is a distinction without a difference. Contractual liens It has also been argued that an agreement by contract that one party may retain the goods of another party until paid is not a lien, as under the common law, liens could only be non-consensual. However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as liens even if they are not expressed to be liens. Maritime liens A maritime lien is a lien on a vessel, given to secure the claim of a creditor who provided maritime services to the vessel or who suffered an injury from the vessel's use. Maritime liens are sometimes referred to as tacit hypothecation. Maritime liens have little in common with other liens under the laws of most jurisdictions. The maritime lien has been described as \\"one of the most striking peculiarities of Admiralty law\\".Griffith Price, The Law of Maritime Liens (1940) A maritime lien constitutes a security interest upon ships of a nature otherwise unknown to the common law or equity. It arises purely by operation of law and exists as a claim upon the property concerned, both secret and invisible, often given priority by statute over other forms of registered security interest.Bankers Trust v Todd Shipyards, The Halcyon Isle [1981] AC 221 Although characteristics vary under the laws of different countries, it can be described as: # a privileged claim, # upon maritime property, # for service to it or damage done by it, # accruing from the moment that the claim attaches, # travelling with the property unconditionally, # enforced by an action in rem. Nomenclature Throughout the world, there are a large number of different types and sub-divisions of liens. Not all of the following liens exist in all legal systems that recognise the concept of a lien. The following are descriptions that are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Types of lien include * accountant's lien‚Äîthe right of an accountant to retain a client's papers until the accountant's fees have been paid. * agent's lien * agister's lien‚Äîthe lien of an agister over animals in the agister's care as security for fees. * agricultural lien (United States)‚Äîa statutory lien that protects the seller of farming equipment by giving the seller a lien on crops grown with the equipment. * architect's lien‚Äîthe right of an architect to retain a client's papers until the architect's fees have been paid. * attachment lien‚Äîa lien on property seized by pre-judgment attachment. * attorney's lien‚Äîthe right of an attorney to retain a client's papers until the attorney's fees have been paid (also referred to as a charging lien, solicitor's lien or a retaining lien in some jurisdictions. * banker's lien‚Äîthe right of a bank to satisfy a customer's matured debt by seizing the customer's money or property within the bank's possession. * blanket lien‚Äîa lien that gives the lienor the entitlement to take possession of any or all of the lienee's real property to cover a delinquent loan. * carrier's lien‚Äîa carrier's right to retain possession of cargo until the owner of the cargo pays shipping costs. * choate lien (United States)‚Äîa lien in which the lienee, the property, and the monetary amount are established so that the lien is perfected and nothing else needs to be done to make the lien enforceable. * common-law lien‚Äîa lien arising under the common law, rather than by statute, equity or agreement between the parties. * concurrent lien‚Äîmeans one of two or more liens over the same property. * consummate lien (United States)‚Äîa judgment lien arising after the denial of motion for a new trial. * conventional lien (United States)‚Äîa lien that is created by agreement between the parties, in circumstances where the law would not otherwise create a lien. * deferred lien (United States)‚Äîa lien that only take effect from a future date. * demurrage lien‚Äîa carrier's lien on goods for any unpaid demurrage charges. * dragnet lien (United States)‚Äîa lien that is enlarged to cover any additional credit extended to the debtor to the same creditor. * environmental lien‚ÄîA charge, security, or encumbrance on a property's title to secure payment of cost or debt arising from response actions, cleanup, or other remediation of hazardous substances or petroleum products. * equitable lien‚Äîa lien that is enlarged to cover any additional credit extended to the debtor to the same creditor. * execution lien‚Äîa lien on property seized by levy of execution. * factor's lien‚Äîa lien, usually statutory, on property held on consignment by a factor. * first lien‚Äîa lien that takes priority over all other encumbrances over the same property. * floating lien (United States)‚Äîa lien that is expanded to cover any additional property that is acquired by the lienee while the debt is outstanding (in common-law countries, see Floating charge). * garnishment lien‚Äîa lien on the debtor's property held by a garnishee. * general lien‚Äîa possessory lien by which the lien holder may retain any of the debtor's goods in the lien holder's possession until any debt due from the debtor, whether in connection with the retained goods or otherwise, has been paid. Factors, insurance brokers, packers, stockbrokers and banker's liens are all usually general liens. * healthcare lien (United States)‚Äîa statutory lien asserted by an HMO, insurer, medical group or independent practice association against those liable to the, also its patient in damages, to recover money paid or claim money payable for healthcare services provided (sometimes called a healthcare lien). * hospital lien (United States)‚Äîa statutory lien asserted by a hospital to recover the costs of emergency and other ongoing medical and other services. * hotelkeeper's lien‚Äîa possessory or statutory lien allowing an innkeeper to hold, as security for payment, personal property that a guest has brought into the hotel (also referred to as an innkeeper's lien). * inchoate lien‚Äîa lien that may be defeated if the relevant judgment is vacated or a motion for a new trial is granted. * involuntary lien‚Äîa lien arising without the lienee's consent. * judgment lien‚Äîa lien imposed on a judgment debtor's non-exempt property. * judicial lien‚Äîa lien obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration or other legal or equitable process or proceeding. * junior lien‚Äîa lien that is junior or subordinate to another lien on the same property. * landlord's lien‚Äîa lien which empowered a landlord to seize a tenant's property and sell it to satisfy overdue rent. * manufacturer's lien‚Äîa statutory lien that secures payment for labour or materials expended in producing goods for another. * maritime lien‚Äîsee above. * mechanic's lien‚Äî(also sometimes referred to as an artisan's lien, chattel lien, construction lien, labourer's lien, in various jurisdictions). * mineral lien-a lien on working interest that secures payment for labor or materials expended by oilfield service companies. * mortgage lien‚Äîa lien on the mortgagor's property securing the mortgage. * municipal lien (United States)‚Äîa lien by a municipal corporation against a property owner for the owner's proportional share of a public improvement that specifically and individually benefits the owner. * possessory lien‚Äîa lien allowing the creditor to keep possession of the encumbered property until the debt is satisfied. * second lien‚Äîa lien that is next in rank after a first lien on the same property. * secret lien‚Äîa lien not appearing of record and unknown to the purchasers; a lien reserved by the vendor and kept hidden from third parties to secure the payment of goods after delivery. * Solicitor's lien‚Äîthe right of a solicitor to recover his costs from a client.

Taxonomy Richard Owen named Cynodontia in 1861, which he assigned to Anomodontia as a family.Classification of R. Owen 1861.

Harvard University 156(1) Evolutionary history Thrinaxodon from the Early Triassic of South Africa Together with the extinct gorgonopsians and the therocephalians, the cynodonts themselves are part of a group of therapsids called theriodonts. The oldest and the most basal cynodont yet found is Charassognathus (Late Permian). Other basal cynodonts were the procynosuchids, a family that includes Procynosuchus and Dvinia. Cynodonts were among the few groups of synapsids that survived the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event and had a slow recovery after the extinction. The most derived cynodonts are found within the clade Eucynodontia, which also contains the members of Mammalia. Representative genera of nonmammalian cynodonts include the large carnivorous cynognathids, the equally large herbivorous traversodonts, and the small mammal-like tritylodontids and ictidosaurs. The presence of respiratory turbinates suggests a rapid metabolism and possibly endothermy. During their evolution, the number of cynodont jaw bones reduced. This move towards a single bone for the mandible paved the way for other bones in the jaw, the articular and angular, to migrate to the cranium, where they function as parts of the mammalian hearing system. Cynodonts also developed a secondary palate in the roof of the mouth. This caused air flow from the nostrils to travel to a position in the back of the mouth instead of directly through it, allowing cynodonts to chew and breathe at the same time. This characteristic is present in all mammals. Characteristics Bienotherium yunnanense Early cynodonts have many of the skeletal characteristics of mammals. The teeth were fully differentiated and the braincase bulged at the back of the head. Outside of some crown-group mammals (notably the therians), all cynodonts probably laid eggs. The temporal fenestrae were much larger than those of their ancestors, and the widening of the zygomatic arch in a more mammal-like skull would have allowed for more robust jaw musculature. They also have the secondary palate that other primitive therapsids lacked, except the therocephalians, who were the closest relatives of cynodonts. (However, the secondary palate of cynodonts primarily comprises the maxillae and palatines as in mammals, whereas the secondary palate of the therocephalians primarily comprises the maxillae and the vomer.) The dentary was the largest bone in their lower jaw. The cynodonts probably had some form of warm-blooded metabolism. This has led to many reconstructions of cynodonts as having fur. Being endothermic they may have needed it for thermoregulation, but fossil evidence of their fur (or lack thereof) has been elusive. Modern mammals have Harderian glands secreting lipids to coat their fur, but the telltale imprint of this structure is only found from the primitive mammal Morganucodon and onwards. Nonetheless, recent studies on Permian synapsid coprolites show that more basal therapsids had fur, and at any rate fur was already present in Mammaliaformes such as Castorocauda and Megaconus. Marks in the upper and lower jaw of cynodonts have been interpreted as channels that supplied blood vessels and nerves to whiskers. Whiskers may have been typical of cynodontia as a whole, or have evolved in this group. Derived cynodonts developed epipubic bones. These served to strengthen the torso and support abdominal and hindlimb musculature, aiding them in the development of an erect gait, but at the expense of prolonged pregnancy, forcing these animals to give birth to highly altricial young as in modern marsupials and monotremes. Only placentals, and perhaps Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium, would lose these.Michael L. Power, Jay Schulkin. The Evolution of the Human Placenta. pp. 68‚Äì.Jason A.

Berlin: Schmidt, 1909, ) is a town in the Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 17,000 inhabitants. It lies approximately 85 km northeast of Prague in the scenic region of the Bohemian Paradise under the Prachov Rocks. The Battle of Gitschin was fought nearby during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. History The surrounding countryside was settled by Slavic tribes at the beginning of the 6th century. The town of Jiƒç√≠n was probably founded at the end of the 12th century, in the place of today's village of Star√© M√≠sto (i.e. Old Place), under the castle of Veli≈°. It was moved two km northward to its present location shortly afterward, which was better protected by the Cidlina River. The first written reference of Jiƒç√≠n comes from a document by the wife of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, Queen Guta (Jitka), dated August 1, 1293. It is believed that the town was named after her (meaning Guta's town, Jitƒçino mƒõsto in Czech). The town was built with a regular street layout around a rectangular square and was surrounded by wooden fortifications with reinforced bastions and a trench. Jiƒç√≠n was first property of the king, but during most of the 14th century and at the beginning of the 15th century it belonged to the House of Vartenberk. When the town was founded two churches were built, a wooden parish church at the southwestern corner of the square and the stone Church of St. James the Great with a cemetery at the southeastern corner. The first was rebuilt in stone into the Parish Church of St. Ignatius at the end of the 14th century. During the 15th century Jiƒç√≠n changed its lords several times until it became a property of the House of (1487‚Äì1607). With the succession of Vil√©m Trƒçka in 1453, the town began to be rebuilt in stone. The fortifications were rebuilt as well, with three gates connecting the center with peripheries: the western Prague Gate (1577), the northern Hol√≠n Gate, and the eastern Valdice Gate (1568), which is the only one preserved today. After a large fire in 1572, most of the wooden houses were replaced by stone Renaissance buildings, often decorated with sgrafitoes; the parish church was rebuilt as well. In the second half of the 16th century, a small palace of the House of Trƒçka was built on the southern side of the square, together with a similar Hetman's house on Lesser Square (Mal√© n√°mƒõst√≠). The palace was completely rebuilt by Zikmund Smi≈ôick√Ω in 1607, but was badly damaged by a fire after an explosion. The biggest expansion of the town started in 1621 during the Thirty Years' War, when the town became a property of the generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein, who made it the center of his Duchy of Friedland and minted his own coins there. Several architects worked for him, notably G. Marini, A. Spezza, G. Pieroni, and, since 1630, N. Sebregondi. He had the palace (locally known as Z√°mek, i.e. ch√¢teau) and the Church of St. James rebuilt completely in the North-Italian style and connected them via a roofed footbridge. The church, intended as a seat of a never-established bishopric, has never been completed, so it lacks a spire and a cupola. The town was to be rebuilt completely into a modern town with separated representative and craftsman parts. The letter was placed into the New Town started in 1624 to the north of the central square with the Church of St. Mary de Sale and a new cemetery. Much of these plans remained unfilled due to the early death of Wallenstein in 1634, after which the town lost much of its importance. The parish Church of St. Ignatius together with the college was given to the Jesuits in 1627. The construction of a villa with a loggia (Libosad) was started to the northeast of the center in 1630. There was a Baroque garden in front of it and a park around. It is connected with the town by a 1.7 km-long alley of linden trees. Near Libosad, in the current village of Valdice, a Carthusian monastery with the Church of Assumption was founded in 1627. It served as the tomb of the house of Wallenstein until 1785; today the monastery is used as a prison. In 1710 the town became a property of the House of Trauttmansdorff, which meant the arrival of the period of High Baroque, during which many constructions were completed. Many statues and sculptures in the town today come from this period. In 1784 Jiƒç√≠n became the seat of a new region. During the first half of the 19th century the town spread quickly, especially eastward. Until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the Jicin ‚Äì Jiƒç√≠n District, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm Klein, 1967 In the second half of the 19th century, many Neo-Renaissance houses were built. After World War II, during communist rule, many prefabricated apartment complexes sprung up around the town.

The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the Y chromosomes of all currently living human males are directly derived from the Y chromosome of this remote ancestor. The analogous concept of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor is known as \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\" (mt-MRCA, named for the matrilineal transmission of mtDNA), the most recent woman from whom all living humans are descended matrilineally. As with \\"Mitochondrial Eve\\", the title of \\"Y-chromosomal Adam\\" is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but can advance over the course of human history as paternal lineages become extinct. Estimates of the time when Y-MRCA lived have also shifted as modern knowledge of human ancestry changes. In 2013, the discovery of a previously unknown Y-chromosomal haplogroup was announced, (primary source) which resulted in a slight adjustment of the estimated age of the human Y-MRCA. 'Y-Chromosomal Adam Lived 208,300 Years Ago, Says New Study' , Sci-News.com, 23 January 2014. By definition, it is not necessary that the Y-MRCA and the mt-MRCA should have lived at the same time. While estimates as of 2014 suggested the possibility that the two individuals may well have been roughly contemporaneous, the discovery of archaic Y-haplogroup has pushed back the estimated age of the Y-MRCA beyond the most likely age of the mt-MRCA. As of 2015, estimates of the age of the Y-MRCA range around 200,000 to 300,000 years ago, roughly consistent with the emergence of anatomically modern humans. \\"we date the Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor (MRCA) in Africa at 254 (95% CI 192‚Äì307) kya and detect a cluster of major non-African founder haplogroups in a narrow time interval at 47‚Äì52 kya, consistent with a rapid initial colonization model of Eurasia and Oceania after the out-of-Africa bottleneck. In contrast to demographic reconstructions based on mtDNA, we infer a second strong bottleneck in Y-chromosome lineages dating to the last 10 ky. We hypothesize that this bottleneck is caused by cultural changes affecting variance of reproductive success among males.\\" Y-chromosomal data taken from a Neanderthal from El Sidr√≥n, Spain, produced a Y-T-MRCA of 588,000 years ago for Neanderthal and Homo sapiens patrilineages, dubbed ante Adam and 275,000 years ago for Y-MRCA. Definition The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor is the most recent common ancestor of the Y-chromosomes found in currently living human males. Due to the definition via the \\"currently living\\" population, the identity of a MRCA, and by extension of the human Y-MRCA, is time-dependent (it depends on the moment in time intended by the term \\"currently\\"). The MRCA of a population may move forward in time as archaic lineages within the population go extinct: once a lineage has died out, it is irretrievably lost. This mechanism can thus only shift the title of Y-MRCA forward in time. Such an event could be due to the total extinction of several basal haplogroups. The same holds for the concepts of matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs: it follows from the definition of Y-MRCA that he had at least two sons who both have unbroken lineages that have survived to the present day. If the lineages of all but one of those sons die out, then the title of Y-MRCA shifts forward from the remaining son through his patrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had at least two sons who both have living, patrilineal descendants. The title of Y-MRCA is not permanently fixed to a single individual, and the Y-MRCA for any given population would himself have been part of a population which had its own, more remote, Y-MRCA. Although the informal name \\"Y-chromosomal Adam\\" is a reference to the biblical Adam, this should not be misconstrued as implying that the bearer of the chromosome was the only human male alive during his time. His other male contemporaries may also have descendants alive today, but not, by definition, through solely patrilineal descent; in other words, none of them have an unbroken male line of descendants (son's son's son's ‚Ä¶ son) connecting them to currently living people. By the nature of the concept of most recent common ancestors, these estimates can only represent a terminus ante quem (\\"limit before which\\"), until the genome of the entire population has been examined (in this case, the genome of all living humans). Age estimate Estimates on the age of the Y-MRCA crucially depend on the most archaic known haplogroup extant in contemporary populations. , this is haplogroup A00 (discovered in 2013). Age estimates based on this published during 2014-2015 range between 160,000 and 300,000 years, compatible with the time of emergence and early dispersal of Homo sapiens. =Method= In addition to the tendency of the title of Y-MRCA to shift forward in time, the estimate of the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, his position in the family tree, the time when he lived, and his place of origin, are all subject to future revisions. The following events would change the estimate of who the individual designated as Y-MRCA was: * Further sampling of Y chromosomes could uncover previously unknown divergent lineages. If this happens, Y-chromosome lineages would converge on an individual who lived further back in time. * The discovery of additional deep rooting mutations in known lineages could lead to a rearrangement of the family tree. * Revision of the Y-chromosome mutation rate (see below) can change the estimate of the time when he lived. The time when Y-MRCA lived is determined by applying a molecular clock to human Y-chromosomes. In contrast to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which has a short sequence of 16,000 base pairs, and mutates frequently, the Y chromosome is significantly longer at 60 million base pairs, and has a lower mutation rate. These features of the Y chromosome have slowed down the identification of its polymorphisms; as a consequence, they have reduced the accuracy of Y-chromosome mutation rate estimates. Methods of estimating the age of the Y-MRCA for a population of human males whose Y-chromosomes have been sequenced are based on applying the theories of molecular evolution to the Y chromosome. Unlike the autosomes, the human Y-chromosome does not recombine often with the X chromosome during meiosis, but is usually transferred intact from father to son; however, it can recombine with the X chromosome in the pseudoautosomal regions at the ends of the Y chromosome. Mutations occur periodically within the Y chromosome, and these mutations are passed on to males in subsequent generations. These mutations can be used as markers to identify shared patrilineal relationships. Y chromosomes that share a specific mutation are referred to as haplogroups. Y chromosomes within a specific haplogroup are assumed to share a common patrilineal ancestor who was the first to carry the defining mutation. (This assumption could be mistaken, as it is possible for the same mutation to occur more than once.) A family tree of Y chromosomes can be constructed, with the mutations serving as branching points along lineages. The Y-MRCA is positioned at the root of the family tree, as the Y chromosomes of all living males are descended from his Y chromosome. Researchers can reconstruct ancestral Y chromosome DNA sequences by reversing mutated DNA segments to their original condition. The most likely original or ancestral state of a DNA sequence is determined by comparing human DNA sequences with those of a closely related species, usually non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas. By reversing known mutations in a Y-chromosome lineage, a hypothetical ancestral sequence for the MRCA, Y-chromosomal Adam, can be inferred. Determining the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, and the time when he lived, involves identifying the human Y-chromosome lineages that are most divergent from each other‚Äîthe lineages that share the fewest mutations with each other when compared to a non-human primate sequence in a phylogenetic tree. The common ancestor of the most divergent lineages is therefore the common ancestor of all lineages. =History of estimates= Early estimates of the age for the Y-MRCA published during the 1990s ranged between roughly 200 and 300 thousand years ago (kya), Such estimates were later substantially revised downward, as in Thomson et al. 2000, which proposed an age of about 59,000. This date suggested that the Y-MRCA lived about 84,000 years after his female counterpart mt-MRCA (the matrilineal most recent common ancestor), who lived 150,000‚Äì200,000 years ago. This date also meant that Y-chromosomal Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the migration from Africa which is believed to have taken place 50,000‚Äì80,000 years ago. One explanation given for this discrepancy in the time depths of patrilineal vs. matrilineal lineages was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of polygyny. When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their Y chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny does not prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future. These fewer male lineages are more sensitive to drift and would most likely coalesce on a more recent common ancestor. This would potentially explain the more recent dates associated with the Y-MRCA. The \\"hyper-recent\\" estimate of significantly below 100 kya was again corrected upward in studies of the early 2010s, which ranged at about 120 kya to 160 kya. This revision was due to the rearrangement of the backbone of the Y-chromosome phylogeny following the resequencing of Haplogroup A lineages. In 2013, Francalacci et al. reported the sequencing of male-specific single-nucleotide Y-chromosome polymorphisms (MSY-SNPs) from 1204 Sardinian men, which indicated an estimate of 180,000 to 200,000 years for the common origin of all humans through paternal lineage. or again as high as 180 to 200 kya. Also in 2013, Poznik et al. reported the Y-MRCA to have lived between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, based on genome sequencing of 69 men from 9 different populations. In addition, the same study estimated the age of Mitochondrial Eve to about 99,000 and 148,000 years. As these ranges overlap for a time-range of 28,000 years (148 to 120 kya), the results of this study have been cast in terms of the possibility that \\"Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time\\" in the popular press. The announcement by Mendez et al. of the discovery of a previously unknown lineage, haplogroup A00, in 2013, resulted in another shift in the estimate for the age of Y-chromosomal Adam. The authors estimated the split from the other haplogroups at 338,000 years ago (kya) (95% confidence interval 237‚Äì581 kya), but later Elhaik et al. (2014) dated it to between 163,900 and 260,200 years ago (95% CI), and Karmin et al. (2015) dated it to between 192,000 and 307,000 years ago (95% CI). The same study reports that non-African populations converge to a cluster of Y-MRCAs in a window close to 50kya (out-of-Africa migration), and an additional bottleneck for non-African populations at about 10kya, interpreted as reflecting cultural changes increasing the variance in male reproductive success (i.e. increased social stratification) in the Neolithic. Family tree The revised root of the y-chromosome family tree by Cruciani et al. 2011 compared with the family tree from Karafet et al. 2008. It is now known that there is a haplogroup (A00) outside of this scheme. The group designated A1b here is now called A0, and \\"A1b\\" is now used for what is here called A2-T. Initial sequencing (Karafet et al., 2008) of the human Y chromosome suggested that two most basal Y-chromosome lineages were Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT. Haplogroup A is found at low frequencies in parts of Africa, but is common among certain hunter-gatherer groups. Haplogroup BT lineages represent the majority of African Y-chromosome lineages and virtually all non-African lineages. Y-chromosomal Adam was represented as the root of these two lineages. Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT represented the lineages of Y-chromosomal Adam himself and of one of his sons, who had a new SNP. Cruciani et al. 2011, determined that the deepest split in the Y-chromosome tree was found between two previously reported subclades of Haplogroup A, rather than between Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT. Later, group A00 was found, outside of the previously known tree. The rearrangement of the Y-chromosome family tree implies that lineages classified as Haplogroup A do not necessarily form a monophyletic clade.Fulvio Cruciani, Beniamino Trombetta, Andrea Massaia, Giovanni Destro-Biso, Daniele Sellitto y Rosaria Scozzari 2011, A Revised Root for the human Y-chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa Haplogroup A therefore refers to a collection of lineages that do not possess the markers that define Haplogroup BT, though Haplogroup A includes the most distantly related Y chromosomes. The M91 and P97 mutations distinguish Haplogroup A from Haplogroup BT. Within Haplogroup A chromosomes, the M91 marker consists of a stretch of 8 T nucleobase units. In Haplogroup BT and chimpanzee chromosomes, this marker consists of 9 T nucleobase units. This pattern suggested that the 9T stretch of Haplogroup BT was the ancestral version and that Haplogroup A was formed by the deletion of one nucleobase. Haplogroups A1b and A1a were considered subclades of Haplogroup A as they both possessed the M91 with 8Ts. But according to Cruciani et al. 2011, the region surrounding the M91 marker is a mutational hotspot prone to recurrent mutations. It is therefore possible that the 8T stretch of Haplogroup A may be the ancestral state of M91 and the 9T of Haplogroup BT may be the derived state that arose by an insertion of 1T. This would explain why subclades A1b and A1a-T, the deepest branches of Haplogroup A, both possess the same version of M91 with 8Ts. Furthermore, Cruciani et al. 2011 determined that the P97 marker, which is also used to identify Haplogroup A, possessed the ancestral state in Haplogroup A but the derived state in Haplogroup BT. Likely geographic origin As current estimates on TMRCA converge with estimates for the age of anatomically modern humans and well predate the Out of Africa migration, geographical origin hypotheses continue to be limited to the African continent. According to Cruciani et al. 2011, the most basal lineages have been detected in West, Northwest and Central Africa, suggesting plausibility for the Y-MRCA living in the general region of \\"Central-Northwest Africa\\".In a sample of 2204 African Y-chromosomes, 8 chromosomes belonged to either haplogroup A1b or A1a. Haplogroup A1a was identified in two Moroccan Berbers, one Fulbe, and one Tuareg person from Niger. Haplogroup A1b was identified in three Bakola pygmies from Southern Cameroon and one Algerian Berber. Cruciani et al. 2011 Scozzari et al. (2012) agreed with a plausible placement in \\"the north-western quadrant of the African continent\\" for the emergence of the A1b haplogroup. \\"the hypothesis of an origin in the north- western quadrant of the African continent for the A1b haplogroup, and, together with recent findings of ancient Y-lineages in central-western Africa, provide new evidence regarding the geographical origin of human MSY diversity\\". The 2013 report of haplogroup A00 found among the Mbo people of western present-day Cameroon is also compatible with this picture. The revision of Y-chromosomal phylogeny since 2011 has affected estimates for the likely geographical origin of Y-MRCA as well as estimates on time depth. By the same reasoning, future discovery of presently-unknown archaic haplogroups in living people would again lead to such revisions. In particular, the possible presence of between 1% and 4% Neanderthal-derived DNA in Eurasian genomes implies that the (unlikely) event of a discovery of a single living Eurasian male exhibiting a Neanderthal patrilineal line would immediately push back T-MRCA (\\"time to MRCA\\") to at least twice its current estimate. However, the discovery of a Neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez et al. suggests the extinction of Neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the Neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of contemporary human genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from Homo erectus.

Her best-selling 1933 memoir Testament of Youth recounted her experiences during the First World War and the beginning of her journey towards pacifism. Life and work Born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Brittain was the daughter of a well- to-do paper manufacturer, Thomas Arthur Brittain (1864‚Äì1935) and his wife, Edith Bervon Brittain (1868‚Äì1948), who owned paper mills in Hanley and Cheddleton. When she was 18 months old, her family moved to Macclesfield, Cheshire, and when she was 11 years old, they moved again; to the spa town of Buxton in Derbyshire. Growing up, her only brother Edward was her closest companion. From the age of 13, she attended boarding school at St Monica's, Kingswood, Surrey where her aunt was the principal. Overcoming her father's initial objections, she read English Literature at Somerville College, Oxford, delaying her degree after one year in the summer of 1915 to work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurse for much of the First World War, initially at the Devonshire Hospital in Buxton and later in London, Malta and France. Her fianc√© Roland Leighton, close friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow, and her brother Edward, were all killed in the war. Their letters to each other are documented in the book Letters from a Lost Generation. In one letter Leighton speaks for his generation of public school volunteers when he writes that he feels the need to play an \\"active part\\" in the war. Returning to Oxford after the war to read history, Brittain found it difficult to adjust to life in postwar England. She met Winifred Holtby, and a close friendship developed, both aspiring to become established on the London literary scene. The bond lasted until Holtby's death from kidney failure in 1935. Other literary contemporaries at Somerville included: Dorothy L. Sayers, Hilda Reid, Margaret Kennedy, and Sylvia Thompson. In 1925, Brittain married George Catlin, a political scientist (1896‚Äì1979). Their son, John Brittain- Catlin (1927‚Äì1987), with whom Vera had a bad relationship, was an artist, painter, businessman, and the author of the autobiography Family Quartet, which appeared in 1987. Their daughter, born 1930, is the former Labour Cabinet Minister, now Liberal Democrat peer, Shirley Williams, one of the \\"Gang of Four\\" rebels on the right-wing of the Labour Party who defected to found the SDP in 1981. Brittain's first published novel, The Dark Tide (1923), created scandal as it caricatured dons at Oxford, especially at Somerville. In 1933, she published the work for which she became famous, Testament of Youth, followed by Testament of Friendship (1940)‚Äîher tribute to and biography of Winifred Holtby‚Äîand Testament of Experience (1957), the continuation of her own story, which spanned the years between 1925‚Äì1950. Vera Brittain wrote from the heart, basing many of her novels on actual experiences and actual people. In this regard, her novel Honourable Estate (1936) was autobiographical, dealing with Brittain's failed friendship with the novelist Phyllis Bentley, her romantic feelings for her American publisher George Brett Jr, and her brother Edward's death in action on the Italian Front in 1918. Brittain's diaries from 1913‚Äì17 were published in 1981 as Chronicle of Youth. Some critics have argued that Testament of Youth differs greatly from Brittain's writings during the war, suggesting she was more in control when writing retrospectively. In the 1920s, she became a regular speaker on behalf of the League of Nations Union, but in June 1936 she was invited to speak at a peace rally in Dorchester, where she shared a platform with Dick Sheppard, George Lansbury, Laurence Housman, and Donald Soper. Afterwards, Sheppard invited her to join the Peace Pledge Union. Following six months' careful reflection, she replied in January 1937 to say she would. Later that year, Brittain also joined the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship. Her newly found pacifism came to the fore during World War II, when she began the series of Letters to Peacelovers. She was a practical pacifist in the sense that she helped the war effort by working as a fire warden and by travelling around the country raising funds for the Peace Pledge Union's food relief campaign. She was vilified for speaking out against saturation bombing of German cities through her 1944 booklet Massacre by Bombing. In 1945, the Nazis' Black Book of nearly 3,000 people to be immediately arrested in Britain after a German invasion was shown to include her name.Berry, Paul and Bostridge,Mark, Vera Brittain: A Life, 1995, (p. 445). From the 1930s onwards, Brittain was a regular contributor to the pacifist magazine Peace News. She eventually became a member of the magazine's editorial board and during the 1950s and 1960s was \\"writing articles against apartheid and colonialism and in favour of nuclear disarmament\\".Loretta Stec, \\"Pacifism, Vera Brittain, and India\\". Peace Review , vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 237‚Äì44, 2001. In November 1966, she suffered a fall in a badly lit London street en route to a speaking engagement. She attended the engagement, but afterwards found she had suffered a fractured left arm and broken little finger of her right hand. These injuries began a physical decline in which her mind became more confused and withdrawn.Paul Berry in the foreword to Testament of Experience, 1980 Virago edition. Around this time the BBC interviewed her; when asked of her memories of Roland Leighton, she replied \\"who is Roland\\"? Brittain never fully got over the death in June 1918 of her beloved brother, Edward. She died in Wimbledon on 29 March 1970, aged 76. Her will requested that her ashes be scattered on Edward's grave on the Asiago Plateau in Italy ‚Äì \\"...for nearly 50 years much of my heart has been in that Italian village cemetery\\"Berry and Bostridge, Vera Brittain: A Life, 1995 (p. 523)‚Äî and her daughter honoured this request in September 1970. Cultural legacy She was portrayed by Cheryl Campbell in the 1979 BBC2 television adaptation of Testament of Youth. Songwriter and fellow Anglican Pacifist Fellowship member Sue Gilmurray wrote a song in Brittain's memory, titled \\"Vera\\". In 1998, Brittain's First World War letters were edited by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge and published under the title Letters from a Lost Generation. They were also adapted by Bostridge for a Radio Four series starring Amanda Root and Rupert Graves. Because You Died, a new selection of Brittain's First World War poetry and prose, edited by Mark Bostridge, was published by Virago in 2008 to commemorate the ninetieth anniversary of the Armistice. On 9 November 2008, BBC One broadcast an hour-length documentary on Brittain as part of its Remembrance Day programmes hosted by Jo Brand. In February 2009, it was reported that BBC Films was to adapt Brittain's memoir, Testament of Youth, into a feature film. Irish actress Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain at first. However, in December 2013, it was announced that Swedish actress Alicia Vikander would be playing Brittain in the film, which was released at the end of 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. The film also starred Kit Harington, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, Alexandra Roach, Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. David Heyman, producer of the Harry Potter films, and Rosie Alison were the producers. On 9 November 2018, a Wall Street Journal opinion commentary by Aaron Schnoor honored the poetry of World War I, including Brittain's poem \\"Perhaps\\". Plaques marking Brittain's former homes can be seen at 9 Sidmouth Avenue, Newcastle-under-Lyme; 151 Park Road, Buxton; Doughty Street, Bloomsbury; and 117 Wymering Mansions, Maida Vale, west London.City of Westminster green plaques. There is also a plaque in the Buxton Pavilion Gardens, commemorating Brittain's residence in the town, though the dates shown on the plaque for her time there are incorrect. Vera Brittain's archive was sold in 1971 to McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. A further collection of papers, amassed during the writing of the authorised biography of Brittain, was donated to Somerville College Library, Oxford, by Paul Berry and Mark Bostridge.

It was published in 1933. Brittain's memoir continues with Testament of Experience, published in 1957, and encompassing the years 1925‚Äì1950. Between these two books comes Testament of Friendship (published in 1940), which is essentially a memoir of Brittain's close colleague and friend Winifred Holtby. A final segment of memoir, to be called Testament of Faith or Testament of Time, was planned by Brittain but remained unfinished at her death. Testament of Youth has been acclaimed as a classic for its description of the impact of World War I on the lives of women and the middle-class civilian population of Great Britain. The book shows how the impact extended into the postwar years. It is also considered a classic in feminist literature for its depiction of a woman's pioneering struggle to forge an independent career in a society only grudgingly tolerant of educated women. Narrative In the foreword, Brittain describes how she originally intended to write of her experiences as a novel but was unable to achieve the necessary objective distance from her subject. She then tried to publish her original diary from the war years but with all names fictionalised. This too proved unworkable. Only then did she decide to write her own personal story, putting her experiences in the wider historic and social context. Several critics have noted the cathartic process by which she deals with her grief at the loss of young men close to her ‚Äì her brother Edward Brittain, her fianc√© Roland Leighton, and her friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow ‚Äì in the writing.Mark Bostridge's introduction to the 2004 edition of \\"Testament of Youth\\", published by Phoenix Press, London. The narrative begins with Vera's plans to enter Somerville College, Oxford and her romance with Roland Leighton, a friend of her brother Edward. Both were commissioned as officers early in World War I, and both were subsequently killed, as were several other members of their social circle. The book's main subject is Vera's work as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse, nursing wounded soldiers in London, Malta and at Etaples in France. It also describes how she returned, disillusioned, to Somerville College after the war and completed her BA degree. It covers the beginning of her career in journalism, writing for Time and Tide and lecturing for the League of Nations. She visits the graves of her brother Edward in Italy and her fianc√© Roland in France. Together with Winifred Holtby she toured the defeated and occupied regions of Germany and Austria in 1923. It concludes with her meeting her husband George Catlin and their eventual marriage in 1925.

The diaries on which the book is partly based were edited by Alan Bishop and published as Chronicle of Youth in 1981. In 1998, the war letters which Brittain also drew on in her autobiography were published in an edition by Alan Bishop and Mark Bostridge. Entitled Letters from a Lost Generation, their appearance was met with considerable acclaim. Adaptations The book was dramatised by Elaine Morgan as a five-part serial which was transmitted on BBC2 in 1979. This version features Cheryl Campbell as Vera Brittain, Peter Woodward as Roland Leighton, Joanna McCallum as Winifred Holtby and Emrys James and Jane Wenham as Vera's parents. In 1998, to commemorate the eightieth anniversary of the Armistice, a fifteen-part radio dramatisation of the letters on which Testament of Youth was partly based was broadcast on BBC Radio Four. Entitled Letters from a Lost Generation, it was dramatised by Mark Bostridge and starred Amanda Root as Vera Brittain and Rupert Graves as Roland Leighton. In 2009 it was announced that the feature film Testament of Youth was in development by BBC Films and Heyday Films producer David Heyman, and was to be directed by James Kent. This had the support of the Vera Brittain Estate, Brittain's daughter Shirley Williams, and Brittain's biographer Mark Bostridge who is acting as consultant. Saoirse Ronan was cast to play Brittain in 2012 but was replaced in December 2013 when it was announced that Alicia Vikander would play Vera Brittain in the film which was released in late 2014 as part of the First World War commemorations. On 4 February 2014 Kit Harington joined the cast to play the role of Brittain's fianc√© Roland Leighton. On 13 February 2014, Colin Morgan, Taron Egerton, and Alexandra Roach were announced to have joined the film's cast. An ensemble cast was later confirmed as filming began, including Dominic West, Emily Watson, Joanna Scanlan, Hayley Atwell, Jonathan Bailey and Anna Chancellor. It substituted Merton College, Oxford in the scenes showing Brittain's time as a student at Somerville College, arguing that filming in Somerville itself would been too difficult in light of the new buildings constructed there since the film's time period. Criticism A book by Brittain's biographer and editor Mark Bostridge, entitled Vera Brittain and the First World War: The Story of Testament of Youth was published by Bloomsbury in December 2014.

Sometimes just known as a Corgi, two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Historically, the Pembroke has been attributed to the influx of dogs alongside Flemish weavers from around the 10th century, while the Cardigan is attributed to the dogs brought with Norse settlers, in particular a common ancestor of the Swedish Vallhund. A certain degree of interbreeding between the two types has been suggested to explain the similarities between the two. The Pembroke is the more popular breed of the two, but still appears on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable dog breeds of the United Kingdom. There are physical differences between the two types. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because the Queen has personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis. History of the breed Welsh Corgis have historically been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. They are of the type of herding dog referred to as \\"heelers\\", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. Both Pembrokeshire and Cardigan are historically agricultural areas of Wales. The combination of their low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term \\"Corgi\\" means either cur dog or dwarf dog (cor = dwarf, gi = lenitive of ci, dog) in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. There is also a folk legend that says Corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles; however, the origins of this legend are dubious.https://writinginmargins.weebly.com/home/did-fairies-really-ride- corgis Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are adjoining historical counties in SW Wales. The geographical distance between the two areas for which the modern breeds are named may have resulted in separate evolution of the breeds. Different tales have been told of the Corgi's origin: some believe that the two modern breeds evolved from a shared ancestry, while others attribute the import of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi to Flemish weavers starting around the 10th century. Further theories on the origin of the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending on the time period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either Deutsche Bracken, or the Dachshund breed. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi has been attributed to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this is the source of the merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh Corgis have been attributed to cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed. The first recorded date for Corgis appearing in the show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis began to appear in conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early shows, as judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them. The Welsh Corgi appeared at Crufts for the first time in 1927. The first Championship was awarded at a Cardiff show in 1928, to a red and white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds continued to be judged together until 1934, when The Kennel Club recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot. Cardigan Welsh Corgis continued to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 by the end of the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi was listed in the Kennel Club's first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list is for those breeds which register less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, with a total of 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was also added, as there had been only 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this on the importation of foreign dog breeds, The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline on the ban on tail docking introduced six years before. However, 2015 saw an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016. In the United States In 1933 the first Welsh Corgis were brought to the United States by American breeder Mrs Lewis Roesler, for her Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had previously been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke corgi, Little Madam, at London's Paddington Station for ¬£12. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada. Tidd imported Ch. Bowhit Pivot for his breeding lines in 1935, registering him with the AKC as Sierra Bowhit Pivot. In addition to his British titles, he became the first Corgi to be awarded Champion status in the US, and the first such dog to be named Best of Group at a conformation show in the United States. A month after those achievements, Little Madam repeated his victories. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi club was formed in 1937, and the first show was held at Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge's Giralda Farms in New Jersey. Following the Second World War, there were imports from the United Kingdom, including Rozavel Uncle Sam which dominated the show circuit for Corgis. In 1949, he became the first Pembroke winner of Best in Show at an open conformation show in the United States. By 1998, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi had become the 37th most popular breed of dog in the United States. A pair of Cardigan Welsh Corgis were imported to the US in 1931, but the first member of that breed to be registered with the AKC was Blodwen of Robinscroft in 1935. They have never had the draw in the United States given to the Corgis of the Pembroke type. In 1997, some 752 Cardigan Welsh Corgis were registered with the AKC, compared to 8,281 of the Pembrokes. Modern breeds A Cardigan Welsh Corgi (left) and a Pembroke Welsh Corgi (right) Welsh Corgi Pembroke at Corgi Symphony 2019. March 17, 2019. There are two breeds of Welsh Corgis, the Cardigan and the Pembroke, each named for the county in Wales where it originated. The dogs share several similar traits, such as their coats, which are water resistant and shed on average twice a year. The body of the Cardigan is slightly longer than that of the Pembroke; both breeds have short legs, placing their bodies close to the ground. But they are not as square in outline as a typical Terrier, or have an elongated body as great as that of a Dachshund. There are only minor differences in the shape of the head, both appear fox-like. The head of a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is typically larger than that of an equivalent Pembroke, and has a larger nose. It can take a few days following birth for the true colour of a Corgi's coat to appear, and this is particularly evident in those with tricolour or black and tan markings. Corgis in the modern era often compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Cardigan and Pembroke Corgis exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials ‚Äì known colloquially as a \\"mad run\\". Welsh Corgis were once used to guard children. =Cardigan Welsh Corgi= A Cardigan Welsh Corgi The differences between the two breeds include bone structure, body length, and size. Cardigans are the larger of the two breeds, with large rounded ears and a fox- like, flowing tail set in line with the body. Though the Cardigan is allowed more colours than the Pembroke, white should not predominate in its coat. The Cardigan is a double-coated dog where the outer coat is dense, slightly harsh in texture, and of medium length. The dog's undercoat is short, soft, and thick. According to the breed standard, the breed stands between at the withers, and should weigh between . The skeletal structure of the Cardigan differs from the Pembroke, in that there is a more exaggerated bend in the front two legs, which fits around the ribcage of the animal. In addition, the Cardigan is more heavily set than the Pembroke, with denser bone mass. There are a greater number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed standard allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a white coat, blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration. =Pembroke Welsh Corgi= A Pembroke Welsh Corgi Two-year- old tricolor Pembroke Welsh Corgi Pembrokes feature pointed ears, and are somewhat smaller in stature than the Cardigan. They are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina sufficient to work a day on the farm. The common height at the withers is between , while a male dog of this breed should weigh no more than , and a female . The tail is shorter than that of a Cardigan, which can be accomplished through breeding or docking. Historically, the Pembroke was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually curly. Due to the advent of tail docking in dogs, the bobtail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban docking, some breeders are again attempting to select dogs with the genes for natural bob tails. Fewer colors of coat appear in the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each of which can be with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would be considered to be a serious fault for the purposes of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard. Pembroke Welsh Corgis have two coats that vary in length along their body. The first coat is a shorter, inner coat that is resistant to harsh weather, while the outer coat is rougher and longer, but still of medium length. The length of the coat differs upon various parts of the body. Fur tends to be longer and thicker behind their fore and hind legs, as well as underneath their bodies. In addition, they appear to have more voluminous fur on their chest, neck, and shoulders. Pembroke Welsh corgis have shedding coats. Health According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey conducted in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: the median age at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The main causes of death were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a higher proportion of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or urethral obstruction. The survey showed that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas more than a quarter of Pembroke Welsh Corgis surveyed suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions typical in the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Progressive retinal atrophy in corgi is treatable by replacing the broken lens. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskeletal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds. Cultural impact The Queen Mother Memorial bronze on The Mall, by Paul Day, shows her with two Corgis. Queen Elizabeth II has long been associated with Corgis. After a visit to Thomas Thynne, 5th Marquess of Bath in 1933, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret made it well known to their family that they liked the Corgis owned by the Marquess. Their father, Prince Albert, Duke of York (later George VI), purchased the Pembroke Corgi Rozavel Golden Eagle, from the Rozavel kennels in Surrey. It was renamed Dookie. Princess Elizabeth was then given a Pembroke Corgi of her own, named Susan, for her 18th birthday in 1944. She had a strong connection to the dog, which was hidden under rugs in the Royal Carriage following her wedding to Prince Philip. Susan became the progenitor of all the Corgis owned by the Royal Household since. The Queen has bred ten generations of dogs from Susan, owning personally more than 30 of the dogs which were either pure-bred Pembroke Welsh Corgis or crossbreed Corgi/Dachshunds called Dorgis. Corgis have also appeared on screen, stage and in novels. Corgis as characters were incorporated into the storybook fantasies Corgiville Fair, The Great Corgiville Kidnapping, and Corgiville Christmas of American author and illustrator Tasha Tudor. In 1963, a Corgi was featured in the Walt Disney film Little Dog Lost, which led to an increase in popularity for the breed within the United States. A theatrical adaptation took place of Welsh author Roald Dahl's The BFG which toured the UK in 1991 required several different Corgis to perform on stage as those of Queen Elizabeth. The Queen's Corgi is a Belgian animated film depicting the Queen's Corgis. In the anime Cowboy Bebop, the crew has a super-intelligent Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Ein, on their ship. The Top Shelf graphic novel Korgi plays on the folklore tradition of the Corgi as a faerie draft animal. It features the \\"Mollies\\" (fairy-like beings) who live in close relationship with the land and their Korgi friends, who are based on and resemble the Welsh Corgi breeds. In the \\"Mrs. Murphy\\" mystery series by Rita Mae Brown & Sneaky Pie Brown, a Pembroke Welsh Corgi is one of the main animal characters. The series, set in Albemarle County, Virginia, includes both human and animal characters, and the animals often solve the mysteries before the humans.

Vegeta first appears in chapter #204 , published in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine on November 7, 1988, seeking the wish-granting Dragon Balls to gain immortality. Vegeta is the Prince of an extraterrestrial warrior race known as the Saiyans. He is extremely arrogant, proud and hardworking; constantly referring to his heritage and royal status throughout the series. He believed he should be regarded as the strongest fighter in the Universe and becomes obsessed with surpassing Goku after losing his first battle with him. After Frieza's death, Vegeta later unites with the heroes to thwart greater threats to the universe, such as Cell and Majin Buu. Throughout the series, Vegeta's role changes from villain to antihero and later as one of the heroes, while remaining a rival to Goku. The character received mixed reactions. Vegeta's traits including his recurring rage over his inferiorty over Goku and his forced relationship with Bulma were the subject of criticism. However, the character's arc and his battles across the narrative were well received by the media. He has also enjoyed popularity within Dragon Ball fans and anime in general. Creation Following the trend that names of members of the Saiyan race are puns on vegetables, Vegeta's name is a pun of the word vegetable itself. Toriyama stated that when he received a lot of fan mail telling him not to kill Vegeta, he purposely did just that. After the release of Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, Toriyama expressed interest in having Vegeta be the lead in the event of another animated feature, though he insisted this was only his intent and no decision had been made.Interview with Akira Toriyama - Saiky≈ç Jump #3, 2014 Appearances =Dragon Ball Z= Vegeta is introduced as the proud prince of the race and the first major antagonist of the Dragon Ball Z series. He travels to Earth with his comrade Nappa to use the Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. Nappa easily fights off Earth's heroes and kills Tenshinhan, Chaozu, and Piccolo in the process. Goku then arrives after completing his training with Kai≈ç-sama. Goku easily defeats Nappa who is then killed by Vegeta, for the shame of being defeated by a low class Saiyan such as Goku. Vegeta fights and beats Goku in a very close fight after resorting to his Ozaru form, but is unable to beat the rest of the heroes due to his sustained injuries. Exhausted and being consistently harassed by Gohan, Krillin and Yajirobe, he barely escapes with his life and is humiliated by the fact that Goku pleaded with Krillin to spare his life. Vegeta travels to planet Namek in an attempt to wish for immortality using that planet's Dragon Balls, cutting the tyrant Frieza off from making the same wish in the process. Upon arrival, Vegeta manages to kill many of Frieza's henchmen and also mercilessly destroys a whole defenseless Namekian village for their Dragon Ball. Later on Vegeta is forced to team up with Gohan, Goku, Piccolo, and Krillin so they can fight off Frieza. He also kills most members of the Ginyu Force. Ultimately, he is defeated and subsequently killed by Frieza while asking Goku to avenge him and all the other Saiyans. Vegeta is unintentionally revived with a wish from the Dragon Balls from Earth. Vegeta's first few appearances in the anime depicted him with a radically different color scheme. After Frieza's final defeat, Vegeta chooses to stay on Earth and has a son named Trunks with Bulma. Three years later, Vegeta finally becomes a Super Saiyan and easily destroys Android 19, sent by Dr. Gero to kill Goku. However, even as a Super Saiyan, he is easily defeated by Android 18. Afterwards, Vegeta ascends beyond the Super Saiyan level while training with Trunks from an alternate dimension in the and pummels the artificial life form Cell, who has absorbed Android 17. Vegeta's overconfidence leads him to allow Cell to absorb Android 18, upon which Cell achieves his \\"perfect\\" form. After Vegeta fails to defeat Perfect Cell, he is forced to participate in Cell's martial arts tournament known as the Cell Games, in which he makes a crucial intervention so Gohan can overpower and defeat Cell in his perfect form. Seven years later, Vegeta allows himself to be consumed by Bobbidi's evil power for his own desire to become powerful enough to fight and defeat Goku. He then goes on an indiscriminate killing spree to provoke Goku to fight him. However, when the monster Majin Buu is revived as a result of the energy released from their fight, Vegeta knocks out Goku from behind after deceiving Goku by feigning a truce. Vegeta then faces Majin Buu alone and ends up sacrificing himself in an attempt to defeat Buu, dedicating his sacrifice to Bulma, Trunks, and Goku. With all other fighters dead or absorbed, Vegeta is allowed to recover his body and returns to Earth to help Goku, the last warrior remaining, against the threat of Boo. He reluctantly combines bodies with Goku using the Potara earrings, to create the fused warrior Vegito, who completely overwhelms Boo with his strength. Eventually, Vegito allows himself to be absorbed into Boo's body to free the other heroes absorbed by Buu, but this leads to the splitting of the fusion. Goku and Vegeta manage to free their allies who have been absorbed by Buu, causing him to undergo a new transformation, which results in his return to his original Kid Boo form. On the Kai≈ç-shin's planet, Vegeta battles Buu again to buy time for Goku to gather energy for the Genki Dama, which he uses to defeat Majin Buu once and for all. It is during this fight that Vegeta finally admits Goku as both his superior and friend. =In Toriyama's films, Dragon Ball Super, and Dragon Ball GT= In addition, Vegeta appears in eight of the Dragon Ball Z movies; in the sixth, Vegeta comes to Goku's aid against Cooler, foiling his attempt at powering the Big Gete Star with their energy by overloading it;Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler in the seventh, Vegeta appears to aid the others in combating a new wave of androids, destroying Android 15;Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13 in the eighth, Vegeta shows hesitation in fighting Broly due to his immense strength though he overcomes it in time to supply Goku with his energy, contributing to Broly's defeat;Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan in the ninth, Vegeta withdraws from attending a tournament, disillusioned by Goku's death, but comes to help Trunks when believing he is in danger;Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound in the twelfth, after having a difficult time with Janemba, Vegeta fuses with Goku to form Gogeta who defeats Janemba easily;Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn in the thirteenth, Vegeta fights Hirudegarn after he steps on his home;Dragon Ball Z: Wrath of the Dragon in the fourteenth, Vegeta tries appeasing Beerus so that he will not destroy the Earth and surpasses Goku briefly following a power boost of rage brought on by Beerus slapping Bulma;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and lastly, in the fifteenth, Vegeta trains off planet with Whis and returns to Earth to combat the resurrected Freeza, being killed by him when he destroys the Earth.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' After the latter two films and anime adaptation in Dragonball Super, Vegeta participates in a tournament where he defeats Frost, Magetta, and Cabba, but is defeated by the assassin Hit.

Vegeta has made several appearances in other manga, one of which is in Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball self-parody Neko Majin, where he battles the titular character. In the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover, Cross Epoch, Vegeta is re-imagined as a captain of a crew of air pirates which includes Trunks, Usopp, and Nico Robin. On September 15, 2006, Vegeta made a guest appearance in a chapter of the Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo manga, Super Kochikame, entitled .

The manga was a humorous retelling of the battle between Goku and Vegeta initial battle; Jelly Jiggler was Goku and Don Patch was Vegeta. Vegeta has made two contributions to music: in the eighth installment of Hit Song Collection series entitled Character Special 2, Vegeta sings the song \\"Vegeta-sama no Oryori Jigoku!!\\". The song focuses of Vegeta cooking a special Okonomiyaki, and in Dragon Ball Kai: Song Collection he sings the song \\"Saiyan Blood\\", which he brags about how great he is. Other Dragon Ball-related songs that center around Vegeta are \\"Koi no Nazonazo\\" by Kuko and Tricky Shirai which focuses on his and Bulma's relationship and \\"Ai wa Ballad no Y≈ç ni~Vegeta no Theme~\\" by Shin Oya which represents Vegeta's reflections on his life and then current family. Abilities Up until his tail was cut off, Vegeta could turn into a gigantic monkey-like creature called an by looking at a full moon, an ability common of all Saiyans with tails. Vegeta has the ability to create and enhance attacks with the use of ki. He also has the ability to use , which enables him to fly. Constant training and his Saiyan heritage have given him vast superhuman strength, durability, speed, and reflexes. Vegeta can increase his strength, speed, stamina, invulnerability, and flight speed many fold if he directs ki into them. Vegeta is known to give names for his various energy attacks. In his early appearance, Vegeta is seen to use attacks similar to several of the protagonists of the series, such as a , a laser-like disk capable of cutting through solid objects, and a ki wave similar to Goku's Kamehameha. One of his better known attacks is the , although he uses it only once in the series proper; during his battle against Goku in an attempt to destroy the Earth. He later develops the and the techniques, which are much more powerful than his older energy attacks. One of Vegeta's most commonly used tactics in the series is when he bombards an opponent with an array of small ki blasts. He is not known to have an official name for this attack, but it is occasionally called . In Dragon Ball GT, Vegeta displays a powerful new attack, entitling it the , where he uses his left hand to fire off a massive beam of green ki that widens with distance. Because of his immense strength and power, Vegeta, along with many other characters from the Dragon Ball franchise, can destroy entire planets if not star systems or galaxies with single attacks if he intends to. Vegeta also possesses several transformations that greatly enhance his abilities to varying degrees. He gains the ability to transform into a Super Saiyan and, through training, can further transform into advanced states of Super Saiyan as the series continues. Vegeta later achieved the immensely powerful transformation under Whis's tutelage. During his fight with Jiren, a mortal stronger than a destroyer, Vegeta unlocks a transformation called Super Saiyan Blue Evolution by breaking his very utmost limits. Vegeta can also fuse with Goku and create a warrior who has the combined power and skills of both. One method is by using the Potara earrings, presented to Goku by the Old Kai≈ç-shin. This results in a 'potara fusion' creating , who, in his reappearance in Dragon Ball Super, can also transform into a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. The other method is by performing the 'Metamorese Fusion Dance', which creates . Voice actors In the original Japanese version of the anime and all other media, Vegeta is voiced by Ry≈ç Horikawa. In the Ocean Productions English dub, Vegeta was voiced by Brian Drummond. Drummond returned in the Funimation dub of Dragon Ball Super to voice Vegeta's Duplicate. In Funimation's in house dub, Christopher Sabat has voiced Vegeta in all Dragon Ball media, including video games. While Sabat continued to dub Vegeta's adult incarnation in Dragon Ball Z Kai, Laura Bailey voiced Vegeta's child incarnation in Dragon Ball Z Kai and Justin Briner voiced Vegeta's child incarnation in Dragon Ball Super. Reception Vegeta has generally received praise by various reviewers from manga, anime and other media. Theron Martin from Anime News Network noted Vegeta's pride as being partially responsible for the success of the series. His fight against Goku during the final story arc was also commented to be very entertaining, despite its length as well as Goku and Vegeta's fighting styles, which Martin considered to have become stale. In another review, Theron noted Vegeta's overcoming his pride to help defeat Cell as the best scene from the fight against said antagonist due to how it creates the climax of the scene. Todd Douglass Jr. from DVD Talk commented on Vegeta's skills and anger, noting them to be a good combination for any fight even though it is a one-sided battle due to how powerful he is. Douglass called his reveal as a villain during the appearance of Bobbidi, \\"the real meat\\" of the story. Carlos Ross from Them Anime Reviews found Vegeta and Bulma's relationship to have too much comic potential and comments that such characterization was lost. Vegeta is a popular character in the series, placing fourth in the 1993 Dragon Ball character popularity poll voted on by Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump readers, and moved up to second in the 1995 one. In 2004, fans of the series voted him the second most popular character for a poll in the book Dragon Ball Forever. AnimeCentral listed him as one of the best villains in anime due to his ruthless portayal in his debut, pointing his actions involving genocide. There has also been multiple criticism to his relationship with Bulma with writers finding it forced. In About.com \\"Top 8 Anime Love Stories\\", Vegeta and Bulma's relationship ranked second with Katherine Luther commenting that such a relationship was unpredictable by fans. Japanese voice actor Toru Furuya expressed shock Trunks was Bulma's and Vegeta's child from the future despite the fact that Yamcha and Bulma were often in a relationship and Yamcha was turned into a cheater to cause such change. Hiromi Tsuru, Bulma's first Japanese actress, was also shocked by this change, believing her character would end with Yamcha.2004, TV Anime Guide: Dragon Ball Tenka‚Äôichi Densetsu Bulma's voice actress joked that it was difficult for her to love Vegeta, having thought Bulma would end up with Yamcha. Mania Entertainment writer Briana Lawerence listed Vegeta 9th in the article 10 Male Headaches of Anime, criticizing his personality and his repeated desire to surpass Goku's power. Vegeta has appeared in the Anime Grand Prix poll taking high places in the category \\"best male character\\" in the 1991 poll and 1992 poll. Vegeta was placed twenty-first in IGN's 2009 top anime character of all-time list, calling him \\"the original unmitigated bastard\\" that preceded Light Yagami and Lelouch Lamperouge, and in the tenth spot in 2014. Vegeta came third on IGN's 2014 Top 10 Anime Villains list, stating, \\"The most famous bad-guy-turned-not- so-bad in all of anime. Vegeta started out as an alien punk with a sadistic streak and an inferiority complex, but over time he became one of Goku's friends, and every now and then, if he was feeling nice that day, he'd help save the world.\\" A Biglobe poll conducted in 2012 listed Vegeta at number 16 of Japanese fans' favorite tsundere characters, the highest among male characters on that list, and a Thai magazine about anime characters also listed him among male tsunderes. In popular culture Example of the \\"It's Over 9000!\\" meme, which depicts a still image of Vegeta crushing his scouter. Vegeta's quote \\"It's Over 9000!\\" has become an internet meme and a popular catchphrase referring to a large number or great quantity. The line originates from the 21st episode of the Ocean Productions English dub, \\"The Return of Goku\\". The costume worn by the antagonist Killmonger in the 2018 film Black Panther is strikingly similar to Vegeta's costume. Killmonger is portrayed by Michael B. Jordan, who is known to be a fan of Dragon Ball. Jordan said Killmonger's battle armor may have been inspired by Vegeta's battle armor. =Music= Rapper Soulja Boy has two songs, titled ‚ÄúAnime‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoku‚Äù, which reference Vegeta in the lyrics. In the song entitled \\"Christ Conscious\\" by Joey Badass, the song's lyrics include the following line: Got dragon balls, like my name was Vegeta. The demo version of the song from \\"First Impressions\\" by Thrice has a sample of Vegeta in the intro from the original Ocean dub: No way! How? It can't be! Kakkorot a Super Saiyan? But he's a low-class soldier, it doesn't make any sense!. The third album released by the musical-comedy group Starbomb features a song titled \\"Vegeta's Serenade\\". The song centers around Vegeta trying to write a love song for Bulma, but keeps getting distracted by his hatred for Goku. =Professional sports= American UFC fighter Marcus Brimage is an avid fan of Dragon Ball Z, even citing the series as one of his inspirations for taking up mixed-martial arts. He names the first fight between Goku and Vegeta as one of his favorite battles in the series. WWE Superstars such as Ronda Rousey and The New Day have worn Vegeta- inspired attire; the former wore a singlet referencing Vegeta and the 'It's Over 9000!' meme at Wrestlemania 31, the latter appeared in full costumes patterned after Vegeta's signature Saiyan Armor at WrestleMania 32 as a part of their grand entrance for their match against The League of Nations.

After she was launched, the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard which built her closed, and her fitting out was suspended. Most of the changes made were to optimise her design, in light of the results of experiments with operational carriers. Finally commissioned in 1924, Hermes served briefly with the Atlantic Fleet before spending the bulk of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and the China Station. In the Mediterranean, she worked with other carriers developing multi-carrier tactics. While showing the flag at the China Station, she helped to suppress piracy in Chinese waters. Hermes returned home in 1937 and was placed in reserve before becoming a training ship in 1938. When the Second World War began in September 1939, the ship was briefly assigned to the Home Fleet and conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Western Approaches. She was transferred to Dakar in October to cooperate with the French Navy in hunting down German commerce raiders and blockade runners. Aside from a brief refit, Hermes remained there until the fall of France and the establishment of Vichy France at the end of June 1940. Supported by several cruisers, the ship then blockaded Dakar and attempted to sink the by exploding depth charges underneath her stern, as well as sending Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to attack her at night. While returning from this mission, Hermes rammed a British armed merchant cruiser in a storm and required several months of repairs in South Africa, then resumed patrolling for Axis shipping in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. In February 1941, the ship supported Commonwealth forces in Italian Somaliland during the East African Campaign and did much the same two months later in the Persian Gulf during the Anglo-Iraqi War. After that campaign, Hermes spent most of the rest of the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She was refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the Eastern Fleet at Ceylon. Hermes was berthed in Trincomalee on 8 April when a warning of an Indian Ocean raid by the Japanese fleet was received, and she sailed that day for the Maldives with no aircraft on board. On 9 April a Japanese scout plane spotted her near Batticaloa, and she was attacked by several dozen dive bombers shortly afterwards. With no air cover, the carrier was quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship, although 307 men from Hermes were lost in the sinking. Development Like H≈çsh≈ç, Hermes was based on a cruiser-type hull and she was initially designed to carry both wheeled aircraft and seaplanes. The ship's design was derived from a 1916 seaplane carrier design by Gerard Holmes and Sir John Biles, but was considerably enlarged by Sir Eustace d'Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction (DNC), in his April 1917 sketch design. Her most notable feature was the seaplane slipway that comprised three sections. The seaplanes would taxi onto the rigid submerged portion aft and dock with a trolley that would carry the aircraft into the hangar. A flexible submerged portion separated the rear section from the rigid forward portion of the slipway to prevent the submerged part from rolling with the ship's motion. The entire slipway could be retracted into the ship, and a gantry crane ran the length of the slipway to help recover the seaplanes. The design showed two islands with the full- length flight deck running between them. Each island contained one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators); the forward lift measured and the rear . This design displaced and accommodated six large Short Type 184 seaplanes and six smaller Sopwith Baby seaplanes. The ship's armament consisted of six guns.Friedman, pp. 62‚Äì63, 67‚Äì68, 71‚Äì72, 83 The DNC produced a detailed design in January 1918 that made some changes to his original sketch, including the addition of a rotating bow catapult to allow the ship to launch aircraft regardless of wind direction, and the ship was laid down that month to the revised design. Progress was slow, as most of the resources of the shipyard were being used to finish the conversion of from a battleship to an aircraft carrier. The leisurely pace of construction allowed for more time with which to rework the ship's design. By mid-June the slipway had been deleted from the design and the ship's armament had been revised to consist of eleven guns and only a single anti-aircraft gun. By this time, the uncertainty about the best configuration for an aircraft carrier had increased to the point that the Admiralty forbade the builder from working above the hangar deck without express permission. Later that year the ship's design was revised again to incorporate a single island, her lifts were changed to a uniform size of , and her armament was altered to ten 6-inch guns and four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. These changes increased her displacement to .Friedman, p. 73 Construction was suspended after Hermes was launched in September 1919 as the Admiralty awaited the results of flight trials with Eagle and . Her design was modified in March 1920 with an island superstructure and funnel to starboard, and the forward catapult was removed.McCart, p. 11 The logic behind placing the island to starboard was that pilots generally preferred to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing.Friedman, p. 76 A prominent tripod mast was added to house the fire-control systems for her guns. The last revisions were made to the ship's design in May 1921, after the trials with Argus and Eagle. The lifts were moved further apart to allow for more space for the arresting gear and they were enlarged to allow the wings of her aircraft to be spread in the hangar. Her anti-ship armament was reduced to six guns and her flight deck was faired into the bow.Friedman, pp. 83‚Äì84 =Description= Hermes had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load.Friedman, pp. 365‚Äì66 Each of the ship's two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft at a speed of . Steam was supplied by six Yarrow boilersGardiner and Gray, p. 71 operating at a pressure of . The turbines were designed for a total of , but they produced during her sea trials, and gave Hermes a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil which gave her a range of at .Friedman, pp. 85, 366 The ship's flight deck was long and her lifts' dimensions were .Friedman, p. 84, 366 Her hangar was long, wide and high. Hermes was fitted with longitudinal arresting gear. A large crane was positioned behind the island. Because of her size, the ship was able to carry only about 20 aircraft. Bulk petrol storage consisted of . The ship's crew totalled 33 officers and 533 men, exclusive of the air group, in 1939.Friedman, p. 366 For self-defence against enemy warships, Hermes had six BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns, three on each side of the ship. All four of her QF Mk V 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were positioned on the flight deck. The ship's waterline belt armour was thick and her flight deck, which was also the ship's strength deck,Brown, p. 120 was thick. Hermes had a metacentric height of and handled well in heavy weather. However, she had quite a large surface area exposed to the wind and required as much as 25 to 30 degrees of weather helm at low speed when the wind was blowing from the side.Friedman, pp. 84‚Äì85 Service HMS Hermes at Pearl Harbor, circa 1924 Hermes was laid down by Sir W. G. Armstrong-Whitworth and Company at Walker on the River Tyne on 15 January 1918 as the world's first purpose-designed aircraft carrier,Milanovich, p. 13 and was launched on 11 September 1919. She was christened by Mrs. A. Cooper, daughter of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Walter Long. The shipyard was scheduled to close at the end of 1919 and the Admiralty ordered the ship towed to Devonport, where she arrived in January 1920 for completion. =1920s= Captain Arthur Stopford was appointed as the ship's commanding officer in February 1923 and the ship began her sea trials in August. After fitting-out, Hermes was commissioned on 19 February 1924 and later assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She conducted flying trials with the Fairey IIID reconnaissance biplanes for the next several months. Hermes participated in the fleet review conducted by King George V on 26 July in Spithead. Afterwards she was refitted until November and then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She arrived at Malta on 22 November and needed some repairs to fix storm damage suffered en route.McCart, pp. 11, 13‚Äì16 At this time the ship embarked No. 403 Flight with Fairey Flycatcher fighters and 441 Flight with Fairey IIIDs.Sturtivant, pp. 466, 468 Hermes conducted flying exercises with Eagle and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1925 before she began a seven-week refit in Malta on 27 March, then sailed for Portsmouth where she arrived on 29 May after her aircraft had flown ashore.McCart, pp. 16‚Äì17 Hermes sailed for the China Station on 17 June with 403 and 441 Flights aboard, but made a lengthy pause en route in the Mediterranean during which Captain Stopford was replaced by Captain C. P. Talbot. She arrived at Hong Kong on 10 August 1925. The ship made her first foreign port visit to Amoy in November. Hermes returned to the Mediterranean in early 1926 and was refitted at Malta between April and June.McCart, pp. 18, 20 441 Flight was transferred to Eagle at this time in exchange for 440 Flight which flew aboard in September. 442 Flight also joined the ship at this time; both flights were equipped with Fairey IIIs.Sturtivant, pp. 467‚Äì68 The ship exercised with the Mediterranean Fleet after her refit was completed and Captain R. Elliot relieved Captain Talbot on 14 August. Hermes returned to Hong Kong on 11 October and conducted routine training until she sailed to the naval base at Wei Hai Wei on 27 July 1927 to escape the summer heat. The ship rendezvoused in September with Argus, which was to replace her on the China Station. Before she departed the area, however, both ships attacked the pirate base at Bias Bay and their fleet of junks and sampans. Hermes reached the United Kingdom on 26 October and began a refit at Chatham Dockyard at the beginning of November.McCart, pp. 20‚Äì22 One of her 4-inch guns was removed at this time. Sometime after this refit, the ship was provided with two single 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" AA guns.Friedman, p. 89 Captain Eliot was relieved by Captain G. Hopwood on 2 December and the ship sailed for the China Station on 21 January 1928.McCart, p. 22 The Fairey IIIDs of 440 Flight had been replaced by IIIFs, and the ship kept the same three flights for this deployment.Sturtivant, pp. 466‚Äì68 En route to Hong Kong, Hermes stopped at Bangkok, Siam, in March for four days and was inspected by King Rama VII. She reached Hong Kong on 18 March, relieving Argus. The ship spent a month in the port of Chefoo in May and then the following three weeks in Wei Hai Wei. While visiting Chinwangtao in July, one of her Fairey IIIF seaplanes made a forced landing outside the port; the rescued the pilot and towed the aircraft back to the carrier. During the rest of the year, the ship visited Shanghai, Manila, as well as Kudat and Jesselton in Borneo. She began a refit in Hong Kong in January 1929 and Captain J. D. Campbell assumed command on 28 March. After refit was completed in April, Hermes conducted flying training before sailing up the Yangtze River to visit Nanking the following month. Afterwards she spent the next four months at Wei Hei Wei. She made visits to Tsingtao and Japan before returning to Hong Kong on 29 October where she remained for the rest of the year.McCart, pp. 22‚Äì24 =1930s= On 28 January 1930, Hermes transported the British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, to Nanking for talks with the Chinese Government over the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and she remained there until she sailed downriver to Shanghai on 2 March. By the end of the month, the carrier was back in Hong Kong and remained there until June when she returned to Wei Hai Wei for her annual summer visit. The ship briefly returned to Hong Kong before departing for Great Britain on 7 August. Hermes reached Portsmouth on 23 September, but remained there only six days before transferring to Sheerness. Captain E. J. G. MacKinnon relieved Captain Campbell there on 2 October. She was given a brief refit at Chatham Dockyard before sailing for the China Station. The ship had aboard only 403 and 440 Flights on this deployment and transported six Blackburn Ripons to deliver to Malta and HMS Eagle. Hermes departed Portsmouth on 12 November and reached Hong Kong on 2 January 1931. En route to her summer refuge at Wei Hai Wei, the ship received a report on 9 June that the submarine had been sunk there while on exercise. Captain MacKinnon took command of the rescue effort when Hermes arrived at the accident site an hour afterwards. Eight of the submarine's crewmen managed to escape through the forward torpedo hatch, but only six of those reached the surface where they were picked up and treated in Hermess sickbay; two of those six subsequently died.McCart, pp. 24‚Äì26 left The ship remained at Wei Hai Wei until the end of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for Hankow. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government's survey of the massive flooding in the area. Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were also in the city to survey the flooding with their Lockheed Sirius float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was flipped on the morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted back into the water by Hermess crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. Hermes received a distress message on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS Ryinjin Maru, that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland at the mouth of the Taiwan Strait. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.McCart, pp. 27‚Äì28 Captain MacKinnon took sick the next month and he was relieved by Captain W. B. Mackenzie on 25 February. After a short refit, the carrier, escorted by the destroyer Whitehall, made a brief visit to Amoy in late April before sailing for Wei Hai Wei where she stayed until 17 September. On that day, Hermes sailed for the Japanese city of Nagasaki and then spent four weeks in Shanghai. The ship did not return to Hong Kong until 28 October and spent the next few months there. In January 1933, the carrier visited the Philippines for several weeks before returning to Hong Kong where she was given a brief refit. After short visits to Tsingtao and Wei Hai Wei, Hermes departed Hong Kong in mid-June for Great Britain. She reached Sheerness on 22 July, but the ship was transferred shortly afterwards to Chatham Dockyard and opened to the public during Navy Week in early August. She sailed the next month for Devonport Dockyard for a thorough refit.McCart, pp. 28‚Äì30 Transverse arresting gear was fitted and her machinery was thoroughly overhauled. Sometime in 1932, the two single 2-pounders were replaced by two quadruple .50-calibre Mark III machine gun mounts. Captain the Honourable G. Fraser was appointed on 15 August 1934 as the new commanding officer and the ship began trials of the new equipment in early November.McCart, p. 32 At the same time the nine Fairey Seal torpedo bombers of 824 Squadron joined the ship.Sturtivant, p. 258 Hermes left Portsmouth on 18 November for the China Station and arrived at Hong Kong on 4 January 1935. The Hawker Osprey reconnaissance biplanes of 803 Squadron were transferred aboard from Eagle before that ship left Hong Kong.Sturtivant, p. 172 Pirates captured a British-owned merchant ship, SS Tungchow, with 90 British and American children on board on 29 January and Hermes was ordered to search for the ship when she failed to arrive at Chefoo at her scheduled time. Three Seals spotted her in Bias Bay on 1 February and the pirates abandoned the ship when it was found, leaving the passengers unharmed. Hermes remained in the vicinity of Hong Kong until mid-May when she steamed to Wei Hai Wei. There she remained until 12 September when the Admiralty decided to transfer her to Singapore where she was closer to East Africa in case a military response to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia was deemed necessary. The ship arrived on 19 September and remained in the area for the next five months.McCart, pp. 32, 34‚Äì35 The ship's aircraft were detailed to search for the missing Lady Southern Cross of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith when it failed to arrive at Singapore on 8 November during an attempt to set a new speed record between Britain and Australia. No sign was found of either the aircraft or its crew despite a month-long search. Hermes returned to Hong Kong at the beginning of March 1936 before beginning a tour of Japan on 21 April, escorted by the destroyers and . She summered at Wei Hai Wei and did not return to Hong Kong until the end of October. For most of January 1937, the carrier, accompanied by the heavy cruiser and the destroyers Duncan and , toured the Dutch East Indies. The ship's torpedo bombers practised torpedo attacks on the cruisers and Dorsetshire in February, working with the Royal Air Force's torpedo bombers based at RAF Seletar, Singapore. Hermes left Singapore on 17 March, leaving 803 Squadron behind, and reached Plymouth on 3 May 1937. Following the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May for King George VI, she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet. On 16 July 1938, Hermes was transferred from the Reserve Fleet and became a training ship at Devonport.McCart, pp. 35, 37‚Äì39 Plans were made in 1937 to replace Hermess three single 4-inch guns with two twin 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, one forward and another aft of the island, as well as two octuple 2-pounder mounts. A single High-Angle Control System would have been fitted to control these guns, but the dockyard was overwhelmed with other work and couldn't begin to design the changes until July 1938. They were scheduled to be installed between September and December 1939, but the beginning of the war intervened and nothing was done. The ship's petrol storage was to be increased to in April 1940, but this also does not seem to have occurred.Friedman, pp. 89, 368 =World War II= The ship was given a brief refit in early August 1939 and Captain F. E. P. Hutton assumed command on 23 August. She was recommissioned the following day, and 12 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 814 Squadron flew aboard on 1 September. Hermes conducted anti-submarine patrols in mid- September in an effort to find and destroy U-boats in the Western Approaches. On 18 September, the day after the fleet carrier was sunk on one such patrol, Hermes located a submarine, but attacks by her escorting destroyers, and , were ineffective. The carrier was then ordered to return to Devonport where she was fitted with degaussing gear during another brief refit. On 7 October, the ship rendezvoused with the and they arrived at Dakar in French West Africa on 16 October. Designated as Force X, they began searching for German ships in the Atlantic on 25 October. Hermes performed these patrols with no sightings until the end of December when she escorted a convoy to Britain where she could be refitted from 9 January to 10 February 1940; the ship then returned to Dakar and resumed her patrols for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.McCart, pp. 39‚Äì40 Hermes and escorting a convoy in June 1940 Captain Richard F. J. Onslow relieved Captain Hutton on 25 May and Hermes continued her fruitless patrols. After returning from one such patrol on 29 June, the ship was ordered to leave harbour only nine hours after her arrival and to begin a blockade of Dakar as the Governor of French Senegal had declared the colony's allegiance to the Vichy French regime. On the night of 7/8 July, a boat from Hermes attempted to drop four depth charges underneath the French battleship Richelieus stern in conjunction with a torpedo attack by the Swordfish of 814 Squadron. The boat was successful in reaching the French ship, but the depth charges failed to detonate. The torpedo attack was more successful as one of the battleship's propellers was damaged. French aircraft attacked the British forces several times in retaliation, but without success. While returning to Freetown after the attack, Hermes accidentally rammed the armed merchant cruiser HMS Corfu during a rainstorm in the dark on 10 July. The impact injured three of the carrier's crew, one of whom subsequently died of his injuries, but no one from Corfus crew was injured. The two ships were locked together so that Corfus crew could walk from one to the other when Captain Onslow ordered most of her crew to be evacuated onto Hermes. They were pulled apart by a combination of the carrier's turbines at full speed astern and blowing of ballast tanks on board Corfu to lighten that ship forward. Hermes had crumpled the forward of her bow, mostly above water, and was able to proceed to Freetown at , but Corfu had to be towed stern first to Freetown where she arrived three days later. The carrier joined a convoy to South Africa on 5 August and began repairs at Simonstown 12 days later. The repairs were completed on 2 November and the ship arrived back at Freetown on 29 November after working up.McCart, pp. 41, 43‚Äì44 The ship was joined by the light cruiser on 2 December to search for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic. They mostly operated from Saint Helena during the month and were later joined by the armed merchant cruiser to search for the pocket battleship , without success. The force sailed for Simonstown on 31 December and Hermes was dispatched to search off the South African coast for Vichy French blockade runners. One such ship was spotted on 26 January, but she returned to Madagascar. On 4 February, the ship headed north to rendezvous with the heavy cruisers and to blockade the Somali port of Kismayo which was under siege by Commonwealth forces. Hawkins captured three Italian merchantmen and Hermes captured one on 12 February.McCart, pp. 44‚Äì45 A close-up view of Hermes sinking On 22 February, the carrier was one of the ships tasked to search for Admiral Scheer after she was spotted by an aircraft from the light cruiser , but the pocket battleship successfully broke contact.Rohwer, p. 59 Hermes arrived in Colombo, Ceylon, on 4 March and continued to search for Axis shipping. She was sent to the Persian Gulf in April to support British operations in Basra, Iraq, and remained there until mid-June when she returned to patrolling the Indian Ocean between Ceylon and the Seychelles Islands. The ship continued to patrol until 19 November when she arrived in Simonstown for a refit that was not completed until 31 January 1942. Hermes was assigned to the Eastern Fleet and arrived at Colombo on 14 February. She put to sea on 19 February to receive the Swordfish of 814 Squadron and to rendezvous with the destroyer to conduct an anti-submarine patrol. The squadron was disembarked on 25 February after the ships arrived in Trincomalee Harbour. The two ships were ordered to Fremantle, Australia, in mid-March to join the Allied naval forces headquartered there, but they were recalled after three days and assigned to Force B of the Eastern Fleet.McCart, pp. 46‚Äì48 After the raid on Colombo by the Japanese aircraft carriers on 5 April, Hermes and Vampire were sent to Trincomalee to prepare for Operation Ironclad, the British invasion of Madagascar, and 814 Squadron was sent ashore. After advance warning of a Japanese air raid on 9 April 1942, they left Trincomalee and sailed south down the Ceylon coast before it arrived.McCart, pp. 48‚Äì49 They were spotted off Batticaloa, however, by a Japanese reconnaissance plane from the battleship .Shores, et al., p. 422 The British intercepted the spot report and ordered the ships to return to Trincomalee with the utmost dispatch and attempted to provide fighter cover for them.McCart, p. 49 The Japanese launched 85 Aichi D3A dive bombers, escorted by nine Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, at the two ships. At least 32 attacked them and sank them in quick order despite the arrival of six Fairey Fulmar II fighters of No. 273 Squadron RAF. Another six Fulmars from 803 and 806 Squadrons arrived after Hermes had already sunk. The rest of the Japanese aircraft attacked other ships further north, sinking the RFA Athelstone of 5,571 gross register tonnage (GRT), her escort, the corvette , the oil tanker and the Norwegian ship of 2,924 GRT.Shores, et al., pp. 422‚Äì28 Hermes sank at coordinates with the loss of 307 men, including Captain Onslow. Vampires captain and seven crewmen were also killed. Most of the survivors of the attack were picked up by the hospital ship Vita.McCart, p. 50 Japanese losses to all causes were four D3As lost and five more damaged, while two Fulmars were shot down.Shores, et al., p. 428 Two HMS Hermes Aerial view of SS Mamari III disguised as Hermes with a false flight deck and island. The merchant ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a decoy ship to confuse the Axis and was redesignated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back into a cargo ship, the decoy Hermes hit a submerged wreck off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before she could be refloated, she was crippled by German E-boats and abandoned in place.

It was reprinted by Face 2 Face Games in 2007. An iOS version was developed by Playdek and released in 2012. The goal of the game is to \\"claim\\" (get to the top of) three of the columns before any of the other players can. But the more that the player risks rolling the dice during a turn, the greater the risk of losing the advances made during that turn. Equipment The game equipment consists of four dice, a board, a set of eleven markers for each player, and three neutral-colored markers. The board consists of eleven columns of spaces, one column for each of the numbers 2 through 12. The columns (respectively) have 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5 and 3 spaces each. The number of spaces in each column roughly corresponds to the likelihood of rolling them on two dice. Rules On each turn, the player rolls the four dice, then divides them into two pairs, adding up each pair. (For example, a player rolling a 1, 2, 3, and 6 could group them as 5 and 7, 4 and 8, or 3 and 9.) If the neutral markers are off the board, they are brought onto the board on the columns corresponding to these totals. If the neutral markers are already on the board in one or both of these columns, they are advanced one space upward. If the neutral markers are on the board, but only in columns that cannot be made with any pair of the current four dice, the turn is over and the player gains nothing. This is generally called 'going bust.' After moving the markers, the player chooses whether or not to roll again. If the player stops, they put markers of their color in the location of the current neutral markers. If the player restarts this column on a later turn, they start building from the place where they previously placed their markers. If the player does not stop, they must be able to advance one of the neutral markers on their next roll, or lose any advancement made this turn. When a player reaches the top space of a column and claims it then this column is won, and no further play in that column is allowed. A player claims three columns to win the game. The official rules merely say \\"If you can place a marker, you must...\\", not stating if that applies before or after a player decides how to subdivide the four dice. This rule is potentially confusing for the following reason: ::Suppose the player has a neutral marker in the 7-column, with two un-played. The player now rolls 2-2-5-5. Of course, the player wants to declare two sevens. The player still has an unplayed neutral marker, so is the rule interpreted such that the player must place their remaining two neutral markers, playing on 4 and 10? The rule may have only been intended to apply to requiring that all die-pairs be played, if possible. For instance, if the player rolls 3-4-1-2, they may choose to make a 7 and a 3, advancing their 7 marker, and they must also place their 3 marker even though they would prefer to hold it in reserve. Variants Variants exist including Sid's own \\"Speed\\" variant, which results in players jumping over their opponents' markers. This variant leads to fast-paced gameplay and a shorter game. For a slower variant, try \\"Blocking\\", where players are not allowed to end their turn if one of their markers is on top of another player's marker. Note that this variant makes it very difficult to pass a player with an established position on the columns on the side of the board (like 2 and 12).

Although originally started for religious motives soon after the start of the Reformation, its members later came to have the intention that the League would replace the Holy Roman Empire as their focus of political allegiance.Merriman, p. 110. While it was not the first alliance of its kind, unlike previous formations, such as the League of Torgau, the Schmalkaldic League had a substantial military to defend its political and religious interests. It received its name from the town of Schmalkalden, which is located in modern Thuringia. Origins Portrait of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse The League was officially established on 27 February 1531 by Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse, and John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony, the two most powerful Protestant rulers in the Holy Roman Empire at the time.Kagan. The Western Heritage, p. 360 It originated as a defensive religious alliance, with the members pledging to defend each other if their territories were attacked by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. At the insistence of the Elector of Saxony, membership was conditional on agreement to the Lutheran Augsburg Confession or the Reformed Tetrapolitan Confession. Nuremberg religious peace The formation of the Smalcald League in 1531 and the threatening attitude of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, who, in April 1532, assumed the offensive with an army of 300,000 men, caused Ferdinand of Austria to grant the religious peace. Ferdinand had made humiliating overtures to Suleiman and, as long as he hoped for a favourable response, was not inclined to grant the peace, which the Protestants demanded at the Diet of Regensburg, which met in April 1532. However, as the army of Suleiman drew nearer, he yielded, and on July 23, 1532 the peace was concluded at Nuremberg, where the final deliberations took place. Those who had joined the Reformation obtained religious liberty until the meeting of a council and in a separate compact all proceedings in matters of religion pending before the imperial chamber court were temporarily paused.article on the Nuremberg Religious Peace, page 351 of the 1899 Lutheran Cyclopedia Growth In December, 1535, the League admitted anyone who would subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, and Anhalt, W√ºrttemberg, Pomerania, as well as the free imperial cities of Augsburg, Frankfurt am Main, and the Free Imperial City of Kempten joined the alliance.Acton, et al. The Cambridge Modern History, p. 233. John Frederick I of Saxony by Lucas Cranach the Younger In 1538, the Schmalkaldic League allied with the newly-reformed Denmark. In 1539, the League acquired Brandenburg, which was under the leadership of Joachim II Hector, Elector of Brandenburg.Smith, Henry Preserved. The Age of the Reformation. p. 119. In 1545, the League gained the allegiance of the Electoral Palatinate, under the control of Frederick III, Elector Palatine.Smith, Henry Preserved. The Age of the Reformation. pp. 120‚Äì121. In 1544, Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire signed the Treaty of Speyer, which stated that during the reign of Christian III, Denmark would maintain a peaceful foreign policy towards the Holy Roman Empire. Activities The League's members agreed to provide 10,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalryWilde, Robert. The Schmalkaldic League, Part 1: Introduction and Creation for their mutual protection. They rarely provoked Charles directly but confiscated church land, expelled bishops and Catholic princes and helped spread Lutheranism throughout northern Germany. Martin Luther planned to present to the League the Smalcald Articles, a stricter Protestant confession, during a meeting in 1537.Smith, Henry Preserved. The Age of the Reformation. p. 121. Luther attended the critical meeting in 1537 but spent most of his time suffering from kidney stones. The rulers and princes even met in the home at which Luther was staying. Though Luther was asked to prepare the articles of faith that came to be known as the Smalcald Articles, they were not formally adopted at the time of the meeting, but in 1580, they were included in the Book of Concord. Political environment For 15 years, the League was able to exist without opposition because Charles was busy fighting wars with France and the Ottoman Empire. Overall, the Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg Wars lasted from 1526 to 1571. In 1535, Francis I of France, who vigorously persecuted Protestants at home, supported the Protestant princes in their struggle against their common foe. The tactical support ended in 1544 with the signing of the Treaty of Cr√©py, whereby the French king, who was fighting the Emperor in Italy, pledged to stop backing the Protestant princes and the League in Germany. In 1535, Charles led the Conquest of Tunis (1535). Francis I of France, in an effort to limit the power of the Habsburgs, allied with Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire, forming a Franco-Ottoman alliance. The Italian War of 1536‚Äì38 between France and the Holy Roman Empire ended in 1538 with the Truce of Nice. The final war during that period Charles fought against France, the Italian War of 1542‚Äì46, ended with inconclusive results and the Treaty of Cr√©py. After the peace with France, the Charles signed the Truce of Adrianople in 1547 with the Ottoman Empire, which was allied to Francis, to free even more Habsburg resources for a final confrontation with the League. Schmalkaldic War Charles V, enthroned over his defeated enemies (from left): Suleiman the Magnificent, Pope Clement VII, Francis I, the Duke of Cleves, the Landgrave of Hesse, and the Duke of Saxony. Giulio Clovio, mid-16th century After Charles made peace with Francis, he focused on suppressing Protestant resistance within his empire. From 1546 to 1547, in what is known as the Schmalkaldic War, Charles and his allies fought the League over the territories of Ernestine Saxony and Albertine Saxony. Although the League's military forces may have been superior, its leaders were incompetent and unable to agree on any definitive battle plans.Smith, Henry Preserved. The Age of the Reformation. p. 127. Despite the fact that Pope Paul III withdrew his troops from the Imperial forces and halved his subsidy, on 24 April 1547, the imperial forces gathered by Charles routed the League's forces at the Battle of M√ºhlberg, capturing many leaders, including, most notably, Johann Frederick the Magnanimous. Philip of Hesse tried to negotiate, but the emperor refused, and Philip surrendered in May.Carroll, Warren. \\"A History of Christendom,\\" Vol.IV., p.199-200. In theory, that meant that the residents of thirty different cities were returned to Catholicism, but that was not the case.Merriman, John. A History of Modern Europe, Volume One, p. 110. The battle effectively won the war for Charles; only two cities continued to resist. Many of the princes and key reformers, such as Martin Bucer, fled to England, where they directly influenced the English Reformation. Aftermath In 1548, the victorious Charles forced the Schmalkaldic League to agree to the terms set forth in the Augsburg Interim. However, by the 1550s, Protestantism had established itself too firmly within Central Europe to be ended by brute force. A small Protestant victory in 1552 forced Charles to flee across the Alps to avoid capture; the heir Ferdinand (King of the Romans) signed the Peace of Passau, which granted some freedoms to Protestants and ended all of Charles' hopes of religious unity within his empire. Three years later, the Peace of Augsburg granted Lutheranism official status within the Holy Roman Empire and let princes choose the official religion within the domains that they controlled, according to the principle of Cuius regio, eius religio.

Spork-like utensils, such as the terrapin fork or ice cream fork, have been manufactured since the late 19th century; patents for spork-like designs date back to at least 1874. Sporks are commonly used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, the military, backpackers and in airline meals. The word spork combines spoon and fork. It appeared in the 1909 supplement to the Century Dictionary, where it was described as a trade name and \\"a 'portmanteau-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork\\". The word \\"spork\\" was later registered as a trademark in the US and the UK. History A lightweight Snow Peak brand titanium spork An ice cream fork from the early 20th century Drawing from a Special sporks for salad In the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued on February 3, 1874. Other early patents predating the modern spork include , for a \\"cutting spoon\\", granted on November 24, 1908 to Harry L. McCoy and , for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term \\"spork\\". Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These design patents do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978 and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998. The word \\"spork\\" The word \\"spork\\" originated in the early 20th century to describe such devices. In 1951, Hyde W. Ballard of Westtown, Pennsylvania filed an application with the United States Patent Office (USPO; now the United States Patent and Trademark Office) to register \\"Spork\\" as a trademark for a combination spoon and fork made of stainless steel.U.S. trademark application, serial no. 609,277, filed January 26, 1951. Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office, vol. 665, no. 3, p. 673, December 16, 1952. Accessed April 2, 2014. The Van Brode Milling Company subsequently registered SPORK for a combination plastic spoon, fork and knife at the USPO on October 27, 1970, but the registration expired 20 years later.U.S. trademark registration no. 901,492, filed October 24, 1969, registered October 27, 1970.

Accessed April 2, 2014. In the UK, Plastico Limited registered Spork as a trademark in relation to cutlery with effect from September 18, 1975 (reg. no. 1052291, now expired). The trademark is also registered in the UK in relation to gardening tools in the name of the same UK based individual who owns US trademark registration no. 2514381. Another British company, Lifeventure, sells titanium and plastic versions using the name \\"Forkspoon\\". In an unsuccessful lawsuit in 1999 where the company Regalzone sought to invalidate Plastico Limited's UK registration for Spork, Justice Neuberger wrote: Materials and uses A Japanese spork Materials such as stainless steel, silver, aluminum, titanium, and polycarbonate plastic have been used in spork manufacturing. Plastic sporks are common in prisons in the United States because they are difficult to form into shiv-type weapons to attack other inmates. Prepackaged meals may come with a disposable plastic spork. Sporks are also frequently used by backpackers, Boy Scouts and other outdoorsmen as they are a lightweight and space-saving alternative to carrying both a fork and spoon.

History Matador was created in 1989 by Chris Lombardi in his New York City apartment. Lombardi brought the Austrian duo H.P. Zinker into Wharton Tiers‚Äô Fun City studio to record Matador's first release, \\"...and there was light\\". Lombardi continued to add artists to the label's roster, with bands like the Dustdevils, Railroad Jerk and Superchunk, before being joined by former Homestead Records manager Gerard Cosloy in 1990. The two of them have run it together since. Matador experienced its first taste of crazed media attention & big sales with the North American release of Teenage Fanclub‚Äôs debut record, A Catholic Education in 1990. In 1992 Matador released Pavement's debut studio album Slanted and Enchanted. In 1993, not only did Matador release Liz Phair's critically and commercially successful debut album, Exile in Guyville, but the label also began a partnership with Atlantic Records which lasted for several years. In 1996, Capitol Records purchased a 49 percent stake in Matador, which Lombardi and Cosloy bought back in 1999. Beggars Group purchased 50% of Matador in 2002 and took over the label's worldwide marketing. Over the years, the label has moved from shoebox sized offices to larger and larger complexes, and now operates in both London and New York. Matador Europe supervises the promotion, sales and marketing of Matador titles in Europe. The London-based office also licensed recordings from some of North America's most acclaimed new artists, M. Ward, Sleater- Kinney, Modest Mouse, and Superchunk to name a few. The roster has also grown with the label and has helped artists such as Yo La Tengo, Cat Power, Cornelius, Solex, Pizzicato Five, Helium and the Arsonists reach audiences worldwide. In 1994 Patrick Amory became Matador's label manager, and has since progressed to label President, as well as a partner of Lombardi and Cosloy. In the early 2000s, Matador had to sidestep unwanted involvement in the current Recording Industry Association of America dispute over peer-to-peer file sharing networks. Matador's Patrick Amory contacted the RIAA multiple times in order to ensure that an erroneous listing on the group's website of Matador as an RIAA member was removed. After several attempts, the name of the independent label was removed from the membership list. Despite Matador's removal from the RIAA list, four of the label's albums have been certified Gold for sales of at least 500,000 units by the association: Exile in Guyville and Whip-Smart by Liz Phair and Turn on the Bright Lights and Antics by Interpol. Matador acquired True Panther Sounds as an imprint in 2009. Cosloy, speaking through the Matador blog, stated that True Panther Sounds \\"will continue to be managed by label founder Dean Bein.\\" And that the reason Matador acquired True Panther Sounds was simply, \\"As Victor Kiam once explained his decision to purchase the Remington Shaver operation, ‚ÄúI liked it so much, I bought the company.‚Äù The first joint venture by the two labels was Girls‚Äô debut critically acclaimed release ‚ÄòAlbum‚Äô and was \\"worked through Matador‚Äôs fearsome promotional & marketing machinery.\\" In October 2010, Matador celebrated the label's 21st anniversary with a series of concerts at the Palms Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. Pavement, Yo La Tengo, the New Pornographers, Spoon, Ted Leo & the Pharmacists, Guided By Voices, Kurt Vile, Cold Cave, Fucked Up, Liz Phair, Shearwater, Superchunk, Come, Times New Viking, Belle & Sebastian, Cat Power, Chavez, Perfume Genius, Harlem, and Guitar Wolf were amongst the participants. During the event Many of the artists stated their opinions and admiration of Matador. Damian Abraham, of Fucked Up, said that not only did Matador give them credibility as a band but also, \\"There were a lot of people who thought of us as that band with the swear word that yells, but Matador signing us was like, 'No, no, no, it's okay -- give it a second look.' We fell ass-backwards into being on one of the top indie labels of all time.\\" Mike Hadreas said, \\"To me, signing to Matador was like getting into a really good school.\\" 'It's a hard thing to talk about without resorting to clich√©s, but Matador really loves music,' said Ira Kaplan of Yo La Tengo Matador has continued to sign bands of various genres including Iceage, Lower, Algiers, Majical Cloudz, Car Seat Headrest and Snail Mail.

Dzong architecture is a distinctive type of fortress (, , ) architecture found mainly in Bhutan and Tibet. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of courtyards, temples, administrative offices, and monks' accommodation. Characteristics Distinctive features include: * High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall * Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles * Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples * Massive entry doors made of wood and iron * Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art motifs such as the ashtamangala or swastika Regional differences =Bhutan= Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual tsechu or religious festival. The rooms inside the dzong are typically allocated half to administrative function (such as the office of the penlop or governor), and half to religious function, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized duality of power between the religious and administrative branches of government. =Tibet= Gyantse Dzong Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called dzongs.Le Tibet, Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, √âditions de l'Adret, Paris, 1999, There were two dzongp√∂ns for each dzong, a lama and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese amban in military matters,Das, Sarat Chandra. (1902). Lhasa and Central Tibet. Reprint (1988): Mehra Offset Press, Delhi, p. 176. until the expulsion of the ambans following the Xinhai Revolution in 1912. Today, 71 counties in the Tibet Autonomous Region are called dzongs in the Tibetic languages. Siting of dzongs Trongsa Dzong, the largest dzong fortress in Bhutan. Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of Ngawang Namgyal, the 1st Zhabdrung Rinpoche. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well- sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. Wangdue Phodrang dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the Sankosh (Puna Tsang) and Tang Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. Drukgyel Dzong at the head of the Paro valley guards the traditional Tibetan invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas. Dzong at Wangdue Phodrang, Bhutan. Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article). Punakha Dzong is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the Mo and Pho Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its ice dam to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives. Construction Roof construction at Tongsa dzong. By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high lama who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration. In previous times the dzongs were built using corv√©e labor which was applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family was to provide or hire a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong. Dzongs comprise heavy masonry curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red ochre band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction. The roofs are massively constructed in hardwood and bamboo, highly decorated at the eaves, and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber shingles weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with corrugated galvanised iron roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7. The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

It was bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Torgau-Oschatz and Muldentalkreis, the city of Leipzig, the district of Leipziger Land and the state of Saxony-Anhalt (districts Saalekreis, Anhalt-Bitterfeld and Wittenberg).  History  After the 1815 Congress of Vienna Saxony had to cede large amounts of its territory to Prussia. The Prussian government established districts in the newly acquired lands, among them the district of Delitzsch. The state of Prussia was dissolved after the end of the Nazi era, and the new state of Saxony-Anhalt was established, with Delitzsch being a part of it. In 1953 the East German government dissolved the states. They were reestablished after the German reunification in 1990, but Delitzsch and Eilenburg (two districts made up of the former Delitzsch district) were initially given to Saxony instead of Saxony-Anhalt. The two districts again merged in 1994 and formed the present borders. In August 2008, as a part of the district reform in Saxony, the districts of Delitzsch and Torgau-Oschatz were merged into the new district Nordsachsen.  Geography  The district was located in the triangle between the metropolises of Leipzig, Halle and Bitterfeld. It consists of plain countryside, which is mainly agriculturally used. There is low urbanisation throughout the district. The Mulde River runs through the easternmost part of the district. On the eastern banks there is the D√ºben Heath (D√ºbener Heide), a nature park extending from here to the east and to the north.

Ensemble, le guide suisse et le sherpa vont devenir les plus hauts amis du monde et ouvrir la voie du sommet Lambert Raymond was a Swiss mountaineer who together with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay reached an altitude of 8611 metres (just 237 metres from the summit) of Mount Everest, as part of a Swiss Expedition in May 1952. At the time it was the highest point that a climber had ever reached. There was a second Swiss expedition in autumn 1952, but a party including Lambert and Tenzing was forced to turn back at a slightly lower point. The following year Tenzing returned with Edmund Hillary to reach the summit on 29 May 1953. Early mountaineering He was born Raymond Jules Eugene Lambert in Geneva, where he made his home for his entire life. Lambert was member to a group of elite Genevois climbers. With this group, Lambert tested his skills against French, German and Italian rivals to become the first ascenders of the hardest new climbs in the Mont Blanc Range. Second ascents of the Croz Spur on the Grandes Jorasses and the North Face of the Drus (where his name is immortalised in the Fissure Lambert) put him at the forefront of international mountaineering; however, it was one climb in particular, in 1938, that gave Lambert true legendary status: a winter ascent of the Aiguilles Diables. Caught in a violent February storm, the climbing party found themselves stranded on the summit of Mont Blanc du Tacul. Lambert was the only one capable of contacting rescue. After three days sheltering in a crevasse, all of Lambert's toes were severely frostbitten. Subsequently, all of his toes were amputated.  On Everest  For more details on Lambert's first attempt, see 1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition. Within a year after the amputation, Lambert was climbing again. His mountaineering career continued through the Second World War and in 1952 he was an obvious choice for Edouard Wyss- Dunant's Genevois expedition to Everest. Tibet was now closed to foreigners but Nepal had just opened up. The previous year Eric Shipton's British-New Zealand reconnaissance had climbed the Khumbu Icefall and reached the elusive Western Cwm, proving that Everest could be climbed from Nepal. Unfortunately for the British, who had enjoyed exclusive access to the mountain for 21 years, the Nepal government gave the 1952 permit to the Swiss. Building on Shipton's experience, the Genevans reached the head of the Western Cwm and climbed the huge face above to the desolate, wind-swept plateau of the South Col. Three Swiss climbers and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay continued towards the summit, pitching a tent at 8,400m. Two returned, leaving Tenzing and Lambert, who had become firm friends, to make a summit attempt. High altitude mountaineering in 1952 was still in its infancy. Even Swiss organisation and technology were not up to the job and, apart from Tenzing, the Sherpas had little experience. Despite the best plans, Tenzing and Lambert now had to spend a night at 8,400m with no sleeping bags and no stove, producing a trickle of drinking water by melting snow over a candle. The oxygen sets were barely operable and when the two men continued in the morning, they were effectively climbing without oxygen. They struggled heroically, at times crawling on all fours, hindered by the dead weight of malfunctioning oxygen sets, finally grinding to a halt near 8595m, approximately 250m short of the summit. Assuming that George Mallory and Andrew Irvine did not reach higher in 1924, this was the highest than anyone had ever been. Lambert's extraordinary determination was further confirmed that autumn when, alone out of the spring team, he returned for the second Swiss attempt on Everest. This time he and Tenzing were driven back from the South Col by the November jet stream winds and, to the immense relief of the British team, preparing for 1953, the Swiss admitted defeat.Tenzing Norgay and James Ramsey Ullman Man of Everest (1955) (also published as Tiger of the Snows)  After Everest  Lambert returned to Nepal in 1954, trespassing across the Tibetan frontier to attempt Gaurisankar. Having failed at Gaurisankar, the expedition attempted Cho Oyu, but was turned back by high winds at about 23000 feet.Tichy, Herbert (1957). Cho Oyu, By Favour of the Gods. Purnell and Sons, Ltd. p. 182 Lambert returned again to Nepal in 1955 to make the first ascent with Eric Gauchat and Claude Kogan of Ganesh I (7,429m). Subsequent expeditions took him to Pakistan and South America. Then in 1959 he embarked on a completely new career and by 1963, now married with two children, he was a fully qualified glacier pilot, flying to remote and inaccessible icy areas - a vocation which brought him considerable fame until he finally stopped flying in 1987. Ten years later, aged 82, Lambert died near his home in Geneva due to complications of a lung disorder.  Honour and respect  John Hunt recalls meeting Raymond Lambert in 1953 to learn as much as he could about the Swiss attempt on Everest: \\"Despite their disappointment, the Swiss were most helpful. However, Raymond told me tactfully, \`Monsieur Colonel, vous aurez gros problemes', meaning, I think, that we hadn't a hope in hell.\\" On 26 May 1953, exactly a year after Lambert's attempt, Hunt himself photographed the skeletal remains of the tent at 8,400m. Said Hunt: \\"It brought home the significance of their performance and made me force myself 50m higher up the ridge, to deposit the supplies for our final camp.\\" Three days later Tenzing and Hillary reached the summit. On the way home, the team stopped off at Z√ºrich airport and met the Swiss trail-blazers again. Lord Hunt recalls: \\"They offered us unreserved applause. In later years Raymond and I became close friends. He was not a demonstrative person, but the warmth of personality, once bestowed, was very precious to me.\\"  References  External links * R.Lambert mountaineer and mountains air pilot 1914 births 1997 deaths Swiss mountain climbers ","title":"Raymond Lambert"},{"id":"247585","text":"A Public Lending Right (PLR) programme is a programme intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in public libraries or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork. Twenty-eight countries have a PLR programme, and others are considering adopting one. Canada, the United Kingdom, all the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, Australia, Malta and New Zealand currently have PLR programmes. There is ongoing debate in France about implementing one. There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the European Union. The first PLR programme was initiated in Denmark in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to World War II. The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments. National variations PLR programmes vary from country to country. Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to copyright legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every book in their collection. Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright. For a nation like Canada or Australia the majority of funds would be going to authors outside the country, much of it to the United States, which is unpalatable to those nations. In Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales.Styrelsen for Bibliotek og Medier (Danish) 2009-08-19 Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries. =Payments= How amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country. Some pay based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, others use a simpler system of payment based simply on whether a library owns a book or not. The amount of payments is also variable. The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable. In Canada for instance the payment is C$38.30 per book per library, with a maximum of C$2,681 (in 2008) for any one author in a year. In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries. The current rate is 8.52 pence per individual loan. =Eligibility criteria= Different countries also have differing eligibility criteria. In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are bibliographies or dictionaries. Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of fiction, and some such as Norway, have a sliding scale paying far less to non-fiction works. Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts. EU directive Within the European Union, the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by directive 92/100/EEC on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the European CommissionReport from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the public lending right in the European Union (PDF), 2002-09-16 pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly. The PLR directive has met with resistance from the side of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that the principles of 'lending right' can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen's human right.The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Position on PLR (April 2005) The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates Dario Fo and Jos√© Saramago.

Its source is in the Karwendel range of the Alps in Tyrol; it enters Germany near Mittenwald and flows through Bad T√∂lz, Munich, and Landshut before reaching the Danube near Deggendorf. At in length, it is the fourth largest river in Bavaria, after the Danube, Inn, and Main. It is Germany's second most important tributary of the Danube after the Inn. Etymology One theory is that the name Isar comes from the hypothetical Indo-European root *es or *is, which generally meant \\"flowing water\\" and later turned into a word with a meaning narrowed to frozen water (hence English ice, ) in Proto-Germanic. An older theory is that it comes from Celtic words and the name Isar is a construction of the Celtic stems ys \\"fast, torrential\\" and ura \\"water, river\\". According to another interpretation ys may mean \\"high\\" as well as \\"low\\", referring to the rapidly changing water level in the river Isar. In the ancient settlement area of the Celts several related river names can be found: *Jizera (Czech Republic) *Is√®re (France) *Isel (Austria) *IJssel (Netherlands; known to Romans as Isala) *IJzer (Belgium) *Eisack / Isarco (Italy) *Isar (Spanish town, in the province of Burgos) *√âsera (Spain) It may be possible that the ancient name of the lower part of the river Danube, Ister, has the same source. Newer interpretations relate it to the Proto-Basque particle *(w)its-, \\"water\\", also seen in similar but otherwise unexplained river names, such as V√©z√®re, Vizela, Weser and Vistula. Geography Map of the Isar Isarauen The river Isar north of Mittenwald near Garmisch. The Isar drains a substantial part of the Alps and parts of the Karwendel mountains northeast towards the Danube river and thus finally towards the Black Sea. Apart from the larger tributaries Amper and Loisach many smaller rivers empty into the Isar, such as the Leutasch, the Jachen, the D√ºrrach, the Dorfen, the Sempt, the Pfettrach and the Gleirschbach. The drainage basin contains some 9,000 square kilometers (3,500 square miles). During the winter most of the precipitation in the Alps falls as snow. This results in an increased water flow during the spring meltdown. It has an average discharge of 175 cubic meters (6,200 cubic feet) per second. This makes it comparable to other medium-sized rivers in Germany, like the Moselle, Lech or Main. The official head of the Isar is located in the Hinterau valley east of the village Scharnitz in the Karwendel mountains in Tyrol at a height above sea level of . In 2003 the Isar spring was ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù, however, this move has been discussed due to environmental reasons. The Lavatschbach, which is the Isar‚Äôs longest headstream, has its source farther to the southeast near a mountain cabin named Hallangerhaus. It is also sometimes called the Isar‚Äôs head. Further on the young Isar is supplied water by the Birkkarbach, which has its source at the foot of the highest mountain of the Karwendel, the Birkkarspitze and the Moserkarbach. Having entered Upper Bavaria after ca. just north of Scharnitz, the Isar is dammed for the first time between Mittenwald and Kr√ºn. Some of its waters are led via the Ri√übach, whose flowing direction was reversed for this purpose, into the Walchensee. Here it is fed into the giant downpipes of the Walchensee power plant. 200 metres lower the plant releases this part of the water into the Kochelsee. From here it flows into the river Loisach, Isar's second most important tributary. Not far down the river a large reservoir called Sylvensteinsee was created between 1954 and 1959 to make more energy generation possible and also to avoid flooding. It is located some south of Lenggries. It has prevented some bad floods in Munich, for example in 1979, 1999 and most important, in 2005. In that year for the first time ever water had to be released from the lake because its capacity was exhausted. Flooding was barely avoided in Munich, literally 'by the width of one hand'. At Bad T√∂lz the Isar leaves the Bavarian Alps. This town marks the river's transit from its upper to its middle course. It now flows through a sub-alpine, glacial morainic landscape towards Wolfratshausen. Just north of the town it absorbs the Loisach, including the water previously drained off for the power plant. The Isar continues on to and through the Munich gravel plain, into which it cuts a narrow, steeply sloped valley. The latter finally opens up and ends within the city limits of Munich. Further downstream the river passes Freising and then absorbs the waters of the Amper, its most important tributary, at Moosburg. This is where its lower course begins. Passing Landshut, the river makes its way through the Tertiary Hills of Lower Bavaria all the way into the Danube valley. Its mouth at the Danube some five kilometres away from Deggendorf is at above sea level. Thus the Isar descends some from its head to its mouth. =Islands= Most of the small islands and gravel banks keep changing shape and size due to the annual floods. Some of the islands within the bigger cities were built up during the 19th century and thus protected against the abrasive powers of the water. Among those are the Museumsinsel (on which the Deutsches Museum is located); formerly this island was called Kohleninsel (coal island), the Praterinsel (both located in Munich) and the M√ºhleninsel in Landshut. History The Isar in Munich near to the Deutsches Museum It is quite likely that the Isar was used as a trade route, even in prehistoric times, to transport wares from the Alps and even Italy towards the Danube with rafts. An existing trade road from the Inn valley across Seefelder Pass into the northern foothills of the alps was built up and called Via Raetia by the Romans. The town of Mittenwald thus became an important trade post in the Werdenfelser Land. At a few places the Romans built wooden bridges across the Isara so they could cross the river with its strong currents more easily. One of these could have been along the Roman road from Salzburg to Augsburg south of contemporary Munich. Thus trade traffic could easily be controlled and income from tolls was frequent and regular. The medieval foundation of the cities of Munich and Landshut are directly connected with the building of bridges and the resulting conflicts concerning power and influence on the economy. Due to the continuing growth of the cities there was a constant demand for timber and lime, which resulted in an increase of commercial rafting. Beginning in the 17th century wares like Mediterranean fruit, spices, cotton and silk from the Venetian Market in Mittenwald were transported down the Isar and Danube all the way to Vienna and Budapest. During the 19th century when commercial rafting was at its peak, some 8,000 rafts arrived in Munich each year. Since the Middle Ages water mills were working at the banks of the Isar by hydro mechanical power. To ensure a more constant flow for the mills the water in Munich was led into small canals. The canals were also used to provide freshwater to the population of the city and also the numerous tanneries of the city and to fill the protecting ditches located outside the medieval town wall. During the annual floodings cities along the Isar were flooded again and again, causing severe damage and even killing people. In 1813 a bridge in Munich collapsed during a flood, killing more than 100 people who were watching the flooding from the bridge. From 1806 on, the banks of the river were fixed and the river was canalized. This led to its deeper digging into the river bed due to its flowing faster. Further extensive measures have been taken since the 1920s to install hydroelectric power plants. From 1954 to 1959 the then much-disputed Sylvensteinspeicher was built for the generation of electricity and for protection against floodings. The village of Fall was drowned in the reservoir. When the water level in the reservoir is very low the church tower can still be seen sticking out of the water. Only over the last few years the Isar was partly turned back from a canal into a more natural river. At the lower Isar between Moosburg and Plattling gold was washed from the river‚Äôs sediments during the 16th and 17th century. However, there was no big economic revenue in this due to the minor amounts of the metal found in the river. Following their executions on October 16, 1946, the ashes of the convicted Nazi war criminals Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hans Frank, Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Alfred Rosenberg, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Wilhelm Frick, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Fritz Sauckel and Julius Streicher were scattered in the Isar, as were those of Hermann G√∂ring who had committed suicide the previous night in defiance of his scheduled execution. Environmental issues Feed of river power plant Muehltal south of Munich. Hydroelectricity supplied yearly: 70 million kilowatt hours. Since the 1920s the water of the Isar has been used for the generation of electricity. This has had far-reaching consequences not only for the local fauna and flora but also for people. To provide the 28 hydroelectric power plants with enough water power the river‚Äôs water is diverted several times and almost the whole river was canalized. For example, just north of Mittenwald all the river‚Äôs water was diverted to the lake Walchensee in 1923 for the Walchensee hydroelectric plant. Since 1990 a small portion of the water, 4 cubic meters per second (1100 U.S. gallons per second) is allowed to remain in the river to keep the area from being dry. The construction of the Sylvenstein Dam and numerous regulations relating to the river (pushed through in the early 19th century) have strongly enhanced its character. The construction of the Sylvenstein dam has prevented the river from overflowing its banks. Lately, there have been attempts to bring the Isar closer back to a natural character. For example, since May, 2000, the river is being re-naturalized in the southern part of the river‚Äôs passage through the city of Munich, between Gro√ühesseloher Br√ºcke and Reichenbachbr√ºcke. To achieve this the riverbed is being widened, the banks are flattened and small gravel islands are built along with near-natural ramps to slow the waterflow. Also, the dams are enlarged in width and height. Besides an improved protection against flooding the river was, thus, brought into an almost natural state and this resulted in an improved quality of the recreational area within the city of Munich. The quality of the water has also improved due to the upgrading of the sewage plants along the river. The number of germs, however, is still relatively high. Together with other cities and communities along the Isar, Munich has set a goal to reduce the number of germs until the water quality is good enough to allow bathing in the river. If this is achieved, Munich would be one of the few big cities in Europe with a river with water of good enough quality to allow swimming in it. The sewer plants on the upper river are now treating the sewage with ultraviolet light, which greatly reduces the number of germs, but still the Isar cannot be guaranteed safe to bathe in because of the entrance of polluted rainwater into the river, especially during strong precipitation. There are a number of natural reservations along the Isar, including special protection areas for birds, for example the natural reserve Vogelfreist√§tte Mittlere Isarstauseen northeast of Moosburg. This area is an important resting place for migrating water birds. There has been evidence for more than 260 different species of birds, among them rare species like the common tern and the bluethroat. To preserve the beauty of the Isar valley Gabriel von Seidl founded the Isartalverein in 1902. This first civil initiative from Munich purchased of land, and today maintains more than of hiking trails. Recreation There are several areas along the river Isar that have been designated since the 1960s as nudist resorts. However, along much of its banks, even within the city of Munich, people can be seen skinny- dipping wherever they please.

Whittaker, with Sherpa Nawang Gombu, reached the summit on May 1, 1963. Unsoeld, Hornbein, Bishop and Jerstad reached the top on May 22. Unsoeld and Hornbein's climb was the first ascent from the peak's west ridge, and the first major traverse of a Himalayan peak. His subsequent activities included working as a U.S. Forest Service Smokejumper, Peace Corps director in Nepal, speaker for Outward Bound, faculty member at Oregon State University and The Evergreen State College and mountaineering guide. An avalanche during a winter climb of Mount Rainier took his life. Early life Born in Arcata, California, Unsoeld was raised in Eugene, Oregon, and received degrees from Oregon State University, the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington. He helped to create the OSC Mountain Club during his time at Oregon State University. Everest ascent In the late 1950s he was a leading climbing guide in the Grand Teton Mountains. He climbed Mt.

After leaving Outward Bound he became one of the founding faculty at The Evergreen State College in Washington State. He was highlighted prominently in the first recruiting video in 1971, advising that \\"not every student should come to Evergreen\\". It was at The Evergreen State College where he conceived an Outdoor Education Program. This program consisted of four distinct Habitat Groups, one of which was the Winter Mountaineering Group. Academic programs at the college at the time were designed to last a year or less. Personal life Unsoeld married Jolene (Bishoprick) Unsoeld in the 1950s; they had two daughters and two sons. Jolene Unsoeld and their two sons, Krag and Regon, reside in Olympia, Washington. Their daughter Terres Unsoeld lives in California. Jolene Unsoeld served three terms in the U.S. Congress from 1989 to 1995. In 1976, Unsoeld and his daughter Nanda Devi were on an expedition to climb her namesake mountain Nanda Devi, the second highest peak in India. His daughter died during the climb, which was plagued by accidents and eventual tragedy. The reason for her death was blood clotting caused by the high altitude of the mountain. Asked at his home (where a picture of Devi was displayed over the fireplace) how he could continue climbing after losing his daughter, Willi responded: \\"What, you want me to die of a heart attack, drinking beer, eating potato chips, and watching a golf tournament on TV?\\"Roskelly, John (2000) Nanda Devi: The Tragic Expedition Mountaineer Books Death Unsoeld died in an avalanche during an Outdoor Education Winter Expedition climb of Mt.

SUMO defines a hierarchy of classes and related rules and relationships. These are expressed in a version of the language SUO-KIF which has a LISP-like syntax. A mapping from WordNet synsets to SUMO has been defined. Initially, SUMO was focused on meta-level concepts (general entities that do not belong to a specific problem domain), and thereby would lead naturally to a categorization scheme for encyclopedias. It has now been considerably expanded to include a mid-level ontology and dozens of domain ontologies. SUMO is organized for interoperability of automated reasoning engines. To maximize compatibility, schema designers can try to assure that their naming conventions use the same meanings as SUMO for identical words (for example, \\"agent\\" or \\"process\\"). SUMO has an associated open source Sigma knowledge engineering environment. Initially, Sumo was developed by the Teknowledge Corporation and now is maintained by Articulate Software.

It was originated and produced by WGBH-TV in Boston. Inspired by educational shows like Sesame Street and The Electric Company, but designed to give the kids who watched it a voice without adults on screen, it was, for the most part, unscripted. Far from seeking to make stars of the child performers, their contracts prohibited them from making any television appearances or doing commercials for three years after they left the show. The show was revived in 1999 and aired on PBS until 2005. Description Zoom encouraged children to \\"turn off the TV and do it!\\" On the show, a cast of seven kids (ten in Season 4) known as Zoomers presented various activities such as games, plays, poems, recipes, jokes, songs, movies, science experiments, and informal chats on subjects such as hospitals, prejudice, etc., all suggested by viewer contributions. These activities were introduced by such titles as Zoomovie, Zoom Play of the Week, Zoomrap (later Zoomchat), Zoomgame, Zoomdo, Zoomgoody, Zoomphenomenon, etc. The young Zoomers were only identified by first names, and every six months, half the cast would be replaced, creating a continuous revolving door of hosts. The mail-in request became a pop culture reference for its musical exhortation to \\"Write Zoom, Z-double-O-M, Box 3-5-0, Boston, Mass 0-2-1-3-4: send it to Zoom!\\". The lines were mostly spoken, but the ZIP code was sung. The program featured its own language, Ubbi-Dubbi, where the syllable \\"ub\\" was added before each vowel sound in each syllable of each word (\\"H-ub-i, fr-ub-iends,\\" etc.). For the first two seasons, a word game called \\"Fannee Doolee\\" was featured, in which a series of statements about the titular character were presented to the audience without further explanation (e.g., \\"Fannee Doolee likes sweets, but hates candy\\"). It was eventually revealed that Fannee Doolee loved all words with double letters and hated all words without them. Each show had one or two Zoomguest sequences, short film documentaries about children with special talents (singing, tap-dancing, instrument-making, etc.) or interesting hobbies or jobs. The premiere episode featured a boy who built a boat by making a ring of sticks and twigs and covering them with a tarpaulin. In the show's first two seasons, Tracy hosted a \\"Tracy Asks...\\" sequence in which she asked a question, e.g., \\"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\\" or \\"What is the world's longest word?\\", and local children were filmed giving their answers. The first season had \\"quickie\\" comedy routines modeled after Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In. The performers in the original series were known for wearing striped rugby shirts and jeans. In Seasons 1 and 2 the cast performed barefoot but wore shoes from Season 3 on. The first Zoom series lasted six seasons (1972-1978) and featured 49 Zoomers. During the second and third seasons, cast members were transitioned with a catchy production number that introduced the new cast members to the continuing cast members. The same song was used for each transition (\\"How do ya do do-dee-do, how do ya do-dee-do- dee-do, how's your sister, how's your brother, how are you?\\"). In the last three seasons, entirely new casts were used. Several episodes were available with captions for the hearing-impaired.

Merchandise In 1974, A&M; Records released an album of songs from the show titled Come on and Zoom (LP ; cassette ), featuring cast members from the second season. The catalogue number of the album was SP-3402 (213 402 under the PolyGram system). In 1973, the cast members from the first season came out with an album called Playgrounds (LP ) that was available by mail order. There were two books published for children that were based on the 1970s Zoom series: *The Zoom Catalog (), published by Random House in 1972, was a collection of stories, poems, plays, jokes and activities from the show, featuring the second cast. *Do a Zoomdo, published by Little Brown in 1975, featured activities from the show. In 1997, WGBH released the video and book set Best of the 70s and Zoomers Revisited ‚Äî Where Are They Now? (). In 2008, WGBH released a two-DVD set, Zoom Back to the '70s. The first DVD was a reissue of Best of the 70s, with extras consisting of behind the scenes stills set to the theme song and a 10-question quiz asking what a few of the cast members are doing today. The second DVD consisted of four episodes from the 1970s series.

Borders are established through agreements between political or social entities that control those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation. Some borders‚Äîsuch as most state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Area‚Äîare open and completely unguarded. Most external borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. History In the pre-modern world, the term border was vague and could refer to either side of the boundary, thus it was necessary to specify part of it with borderline or borderland. During the medieval period the government's control frequently diminished the further people got from the capital, therefore borderland (especially impassable terrain) attracted many outlaws, there the outlaws often found sympathizers. In the past, many borders were not clearly defined lines; instead there were often intervening areas often claimed and fought over by both sides, sometimes called marchlands. Special cases in modern times were the Saudi Arabian‚ÄìIraqi neutral zone from 1922 to 1991 and the Saudi‚ÄìKuwaiti neutral zone from 1922 until 1970. In modern times, marchlands have been replaced by clearly defined and demarcated borders. For the purposes of border control, airports and seaports are also classed as borders. Most countries have some form of border control to regulate or limit the movement of people, animals, and goods into and out of the country. Under international law, each country is generally permitted to legislate the conditions that have to be met in order to cross its borders, and to prevent people from crossing its borders in violation of those laws. Some borders require presentation of legal paperwork like passports and visas, or other identity documents, for persons to cross borders. To stay or work within a country's borders aliens (foreign persons) may need special immigration documents or permits; but possession of such documents does not guarantee that the person should be allowed to cross the border. Moving goods across a border often requires the payment of excise tax, often collected by customs officials. Animals (and occasionally humans) moving across borders may need to go into quarantine to prevent the spread of exotic infectious diseases. Most countries prohibit carrying illegal drugs or endangered animals across their borders. Moving goods, animals, or people illegally across a border, without declaring them or seeking permission, or deliberately evading official inspection, constitutes smuggling. Controls on car liability insurance validity and other formalities may also take place. In places where smuggling, migration, and infiltration are a problem, many countries fortify borders with fences and barriers, and institute formal border control procedures. These can extend inland, as in the United States where the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service has jurisdiction to operate up to 100 miles from any land or sea boundary.The Constitution in the 100-Mile Border Zone On the other hand, some borders are merely signposted. This is common in countries within the European Schengen Area and on rural sections of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Borders may even be completely unmarked, typically in remote or forested regions; such borders are often described as \\"porous\\". Migration within territorial borders, and outside of them, represented an old and established pattern of movement in African countries, in seeking work and food, and to maintain ties with kin who had moved across the previously porous borders of their homelands. When the colonial frontiers were drawn, Western countries attempted to obtain a monopoly on the recruitment of labor in many African countries, which altered the practical and institutional context in which the old migration patterns had been followed, and some might argue, are still followed today. The frontiers were particularly porous for the physical movement of migrants, and people living in borderlands easily maintained transnational cultural and social networks. A border may have been: * Agreed by the countries on both sides * Imposed by the country on one side * Imposed by third parties, e.g. an international conference * Inherited from a former state, colonial power or aristocratic territory * Inherited from a former internal border, such as within the former Soviet Union * Never formally defined. In addition, a border may be a de facto military ceasefire line. Classification = Political borders = Political borders are imposed on the world through human agency.Robinson, Edward Heath. Reexamining Fiat, Bona Fide and Force Dynamic Boundaries for Geopolitical Entities and their Placement in DOLCE Applied Ontology 2012 7: pp. 93‚Äì108 That means that although a political border may follow a river or mountain range, such a feature does not automatically define the political border, even though it may be a major physical barrier to crossing. Political borders are often classified by whether or not they follow conspicuous physical features on the earth. = Natural borders = A photograph of the France‚ÄìItaly border at night. The southwestern end of the Alps separates the two countries. Natural borders are geographical features that present natural obstacles to communication and transport. Existing political borders are often a formalization of such historical, natural obstacles. Some geographical features that often constitute natural borders are: * Oceans: oceans create very costly natural borders. Very few countries span more than one continent. Only very large and resource-rich states are able to sustain the costs of governance across oceans for longer periods of time. * Rivers: some political borders have been formalized along natural borders formed by rivers. Some examples are: the Niagara River (Canada‚ÄìUSA), the Rio Grande (Mexico‚ÄìUSA), the Rhine (France‚ÄìGermany), and the Mekong (Thailand‚ÄìLaos). If a precise line is desired, it is often drawn along the thalweg, the deepest line along the river. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses defined the middle of the river Arnon as the border between Moab and the Israelite tribes settling east of the Jordan (). The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1910 that the boundary between the American states of Maryland and West Virginia is the south bank of the Potomac River. * Lakes: larger lakes create natural borders. One example is the natural border created by Lake Tanganyika, with the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia on its west shore and Tanzania and Burundi on the east. * Forests: denser jungles or forests can create strong natural borders. One example of a natural forest border is the Amazon rainforest, separating Brazil and Bolivia from Peru, Colombia, Venezuela and Guyana. * Mountain ranges: research on borders suggests that mountains have especially strong effects as natural borders. Many nations in Europe and Asia have had their political borders defined along mountain ranges, often along a drainage divide. Throughout history, technological advances have reduced the costs of transport and communication across the natural borders. That has reduced the significance of natural borders over time. As a result, political borders that have been formalized more recently, such as those in Africa or Americas, typically conform less to natural borders than very old borders, such as those in Europe or Asia, do. = Landscape borders = A landscape border is a mixture of political and natural borders. One example is the defensive forest created by China's Song Dynasty in the eleventh century. Such a border is political in the sense that it is human demarcated, usually through a treaty. However, a landscape border is not demarcated by fences and walls but instead landscape features such as forests, mountains, and water bodies. It is different from a natural border, however, in the sense that the border landscape is not natural but human-engineered. Such a landscape usually differs from the borderland's natural geography and its building requires tremendous human labor and financial investment. =Geometric borders= Geometric boundaries are formed by straight lines (such as lines of latitude or longitude), or occasionally arcs (Pennsylvania/Delaware), regardless of the physical and cultural features of the area. Such political boundaries are often found around the states that developed out of colonial holdings, such as in North America, Africa and the Middle East. The Canada‚ÄìUnited States border from Lake of the Woods Ontario/Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean follows the 49th parallel for roughly . =Fiat borders= A generalization of the idea of geometric borders is the idea of fiat boundaries by which is meant any sort of boundary that does not track an underlying bona fide physical discontinuity (fiat, latin for ‚Äúlet it be done‚Äù, a decision). Fiat boundaries are typically the product of human demarcation, such as in demarcating electoral districts or postal districts.Smith, Barry, 1995, \\"On Drawing Lines on a Map\\" in A. U. Frank, W. Kuhn and D. M. Mark (eds.), Spatial Information Theory. Proceedings of COSIT 1995, Berlin/Heidelberg/Vienna/New York/London/Tokyo: Springer Verlag, 475‚Äì484. =Relic borders= The purpose of the Great Wall of China was to stop people and militaries from crossing the northern border of China. Today it is a relic border. A relic border is a former boundary, which may no longer be a legal boundary at all. However, the former presence of the boundary can still be seen in the landscape. For instance, the boundary between East and West Germany is no longer an international boundary, but it can still be seen because of historical markers on the landscape, and it is still a cultural and economic division in Germany. Other examples include the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Vietnam (defunct since 1975) and the border between North and South Yemen (defunct since 1990). Occasionally a relic border is reconstituted in some form, for example the border between British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland ceased to exist when the two colonies merged to form the independent state of Somalia in 1960, however when the former British Somaliland declared independence in 1991 it claimed the former British-Italian line as its eastern border. = Lines of Control = A line of control (LoC) refers to a militarized buffer border between two or more nations that has yet to achieve permanent border status. LoC borders are typically under military control and are not recognized as an official international border. Formally known as a cease-fire line, an LoC was first created with the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan. Similar to a cease-fire line, an LoC is typically the result of war, military stalemates and unresolved land ownership conflict. = Maritime borders = A maritime border is a division enclosing an area in the ocean where a nation has exclusive rights over the mineral and biological resources,VLIZ Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase, General info; retrieved 19 November 2010 encompassing maritime features, limits and zones.Geoscience Australia, Maritime definitions; retrieved 19 November 2010 Maritime borders represent the jurisdictional borders of a maritime nationUnited States Department of State, Maritime boundaries ; retrieved 19 November 2010. and are recognized by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Maritime borders exist in the context of territorial waters, contiguous zones, and exclusive economic zones; however, the terminology does not encompass lake or river boundaries, which are considered within the context of land boundaries. Some maritime borders have remained indeterminate despite efforts to clarify them. This is explained by an array of factors, some of which illustrate regional problems.Valencia, Mark J. (2001). = Airspace borders = Airspace is the atmosphere located within a countries controlled international and maritime borders. All sovereign countries hold the right to regulate and protect air space under the international law of Air sovereignty. The horizontal boundaries of airspace are similar to the policies of \\"high seas\\" in maritime law. Airspace extends 12 nautical miles from the coast of a country and it holds responsibility for protecting its own airspace unless under NATO peacetime protection. With international agreement a country can assume the responsibility of protecting or controlling the atmosphere over International Airspaces such as the Pacific Ocean. The vertical boundaries of airspace are not officially set or regulated internationally. However, there is a general agreement of vertical airspace ending at the point of the K√°rm√°n line. The K√°rm√°n line is a peak point at the altitude of 62 mi (100 km) above the earths surface, setting a boundary between the earths atmosphere and outer space governed by space law. Airspace regulations are set by nations and local governments within an airspace, regulations of airspace differ by country and location. =Frontier= The frontier is a border that is open-ended to one side, identifying an expanding borderland to one side. This type of border can be fairly abstract and has been identified as a particular state of mind for human activity. As such frontiers have been applied to borderlands identifying and claiming them as terra nullius.  Types of border regulation  = Open borders = Indian and Pakistan border officers at the Indian-Pakistan border An open border is the deregulation and or lack of regulation on the movement of persons between nations and jurisdictions, this does not apply to trade or movement between privately owned land areas. Most nations have open borders for travel within their nation of travel, though more authoritarian states may limit the freedom of internal movement of its citizens, as for example in the former USSR. However, only a handful of nations have deregulated open borders with other nations, an example of this being European countries under the Schengen Agreement or the open Belarus-Russia border. Open borders used to be very common amongst all nations, however this became less common after the First World War, which lead to the regulation of open borders, making them less common and no longer feasible for most industrialized nations.\\"International Union for the Scientific Study of Population : XXIV General Population Conference, Salvador da Bahia, Brazil : Plenary Debate no 4\\"(PDF). Web.archive.org. 24 August 2001. Archived from the original on August 1, 2014. Retrieved 2018-07-26. = Regulated borders = Crossing the bridge into Canada, from the US. This is the Ambassador Bridge Regulated Borders have varying degrees of control on the movement of persons and trade between nations and jurisdictions. Most Industrialized nations have regulations on entry and require one or more of the following procedures: visa check, passport check or customs checks. Most regulated borders have regulations on immigration, types of wildlife and plants, and illegal objects such as drugs or weapons. Overall border regulations are placed by national and local governments and can vary depending on nation and current political or economic conditions. Some of the most regulated borders in the world include: Australia, the United States, Israel, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United Arab Emirates. These nations have government controlled border agencies and organizations that enforce border regulation policies on and within their borders. = Demilitarized zones = A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a border separating two or more nations, groups or militaries that have agreed to prohibit the use of military activity or force within the border's bounds. A DMZ can act as a war boundary, ceasefire line, wildlife preserve, or a de facto international border. An example of a demilitarized international border is the 38th parallel between North and South Korea. Other notable DMZ zones include Antarctica and outer space (consisting of all space 100 miles away from the earth's surface), both are preserved for world research and exploration. The prohibition of control by nations can make a DMZ unexposed to human influence and thus developed into a natural border or wildlife preserve, such as on the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone, and the Green Line in Cyprus. Border economics The United States‚ÄìMexico border: San Diego‚ÄìTijuana. A border wall on a beach separating the United States and Mexico The presence of borders often fosters certain economic features or anomalies. Wherever two jurisdictions come into contact, special economic opportunities arise for border trade. Smuggling provides a classic case; contrariwise, a border region may flourish on the provision of excise or of import‚Äìexport services ‚Äî legal or quasi-legal, corrupt or legitimate. Different regulations on either side of a border may encourage services to position themselves at or near that border: thus the provision of pornography, of prostitution, of alcohol, fireworks, and/or of narcotics may cluster around borders, city limits, county lines, ports and airports. In a more planned and official context, Special Economic Zones (SEZs) often tend to cluster near borders or ports. Even if the goods are not perceived to be undesirable, states will still seek to document and regulate the cross-border trade in order to collect tariffs and benefit from foreign currency exchange revenues.Pavanello, Sara 2010. Working across borders ‚Äì Harnessing the potential of cross-border activities to improve livelihood security in the Horn of Africa drylands . London: Overseas Development Institute Thus, there is the concept unofficial trade in goods otherwise legal; for example, the cross-border trade in livestock by pastoralists in the Horn of Africa. Ethiopia sells an estimated $250 to $300 million of livestock to Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti every year unofficially, over 100 times the official estimate. Human economic traffic across borders (apart from kidnapping) may involve mass commuting between workplaces and residential settlements. The removal of internal barriers to commerce, as in France after the French Revolution or in Europe since the 1940s, de-emphasises border-based economic activity and fosters free trade. Euroregions are similar official structures built around commuting across boundary. Politics Borders between Israel, Syria and Lebanon in Mount Hermon region.

Many borders in the world have checkpoints where border control agents inspect persons and/or goods crossing the boundary. In much of Europe, controls on persons were abolished by the 1985 Schengen Agreement and subsequent European Union legislation. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, the competence to pass laws on crossing internal and external borders within the European Union and the associated Schengen Area states (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein) lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the European Union, except where states have used a specific right to opt out (United Kingdom and Ireland, which maintain the Common Travel Area amongst themselves). The United States has notably increased measures taken in border control on the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and the United States‚ÄìMexico border during its War on Terrorism (See Shantz 2010). One American writer has said that the US-Mexico border is probably \\"the world's longest boundary between a First World and Third World country\\".Murphy, Cullen. Roman Empire: gold standard of immigration. Los Angeles Times, June 16, 1907 (accessed here June 20, 2007) The Swiss‚ÄìItalian border Historic borders such as the Great Wall of China, the Maginot Line, and Hadrian's Wall have played a great many roles and been marked in different ways. While the stone walls, the Great Wall of China and the Roman Hadrian's Wall in Britain had military functions, the entirety of the Roman borders were very porous, which encouraged Roman economic activity with neighbors.Murphy 2007 On the other hand, a border like the Maginot Line was entirely military and was meant to prevent any access in what was to be World War II to France by its neighbor, Germany; Germany ended up going around the Maginot Line through Belgium just as it had done in World War I. =Border conflict= Border conflicts or the potential of such are the reason why many borders feature fortifications and zoneing like no man's lands, demilitarized zones, demarcation lines and buffer zones. Legal regimes Today's international borders are shaped and regulated by international agreementss, cooperation and institutions like the United Nations facilitating this internationalism. One example of recurring negotiations of borders are water borders. Border construction and crossings Borders have sometimes been significantly shaped by physical border constructions and openings. From border crossings, over border markers to border barriers these constructions fulfill many different functions. Such as also providing crossover. =Crossings and transition= Even the most fortified borders reserve specific places to allow crossing. The many forms of borders have different ways of enabling and controlling passage. =Movement and permeability= Borders can have an significant impact on and function for movement. It can enable and stop movement, across as well as along borders. The permeability of borders depends on its construction, availability of crossings, regulation and types or scope of activity. The permeability can vary, borders can be barriers for humans, but also for animal migration or types of pollution. Overlap and cooperation Borders facilitate or block hybrids like border overlap and cooperation beyond mere encounter and exchange. =Cross-border regions= Macro-regional integration initiatives, such as the European Union and NAFTA, have spurred the establishment of cross-border regions. These are initiatives driven by local or regional authorities, aimed at dealing with local border-transcending problems such as transport and environmental degradation.Perkmann, M, Building governance institutions across European borders, Regional Studies, 1999, Vol: 33, pages: 657‚Äì667, hdl.handle.net Many cross-border regions are also active in encouraging intercultural communication and dialogue as well as cross- border economic development strategies. In Europe, the European Union provides financial support to cross-border regions via its Interreg programme. The Council of Europe has issued the Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation, providing a legal framework for cross-border co-operation even though it is in practice rarely used by Euroregions. Border studies There has been a renaissance in the study of borders starting with the end of the 1990s, partially from the creation of a counter-narrative to the discourse about the world becoming a borderless and deterritorialized place, which has accompanied theories about globalization.D. Newman & A. Paasi, \`Fences and neighbours in the post-modern world: boundary narratives in political geography', Progress in Human Geography, Vol 22 (2), 186‚Äì207, 1998D. Newman, \\"The lines that continue to separate us: Borders in our borderless world\\", Progress in Human Geography, Vol 30 (2), 1‚Äì19, 2006. Examples of recent initiatives are the Border Regions in Transition network of scholars,Border Regions in Transition IX Conference, North American and European Border Regions in Comparative Perspective: Markets, States and Border Communities, (January 12‚Äì15, 2008) Victoria, BC Canada and Bellingham, WA United States. the International Boundaries Research Unit at the University of Durham,International Boundaries Research Unit, University of Durham. the Association for Borderlands Studies based in North America,Association for Borderland Studies. the African Borderlands Research Network (ABORNE) and the founding of smaller border research centres at NijmegenNijmegen Centre for Border Research. and Queen's University Belfast.Centre for International Borders Research (CIBR) Queen's University Belfast  Border Art  Border art is a contemporary art practice rooted in the socio-political experience(s), such as of those on the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, or frontera. Since its conception in the mid-80's, this artistic practice has assisted in the development of questions surrounding homeland, borders, surveillance, identity, race, ethnicity, and national origin(s). Border art as a conceptual artistic practice, however, opens up the possibility for artists to explore similar concerns of identity and national origin(s) but whose location is not specific to the U.S-M√©xico border. A border can be a division, dividing groups of people and families. Borders can include but are not limited to language, culture, social and economic class, religion, and national identity. In addition to a division, a border can also conceive a borderland area that can create a cohesive community separate from the mainstream cultures and identities portrayed in the communities away from the borders, such as the Tijuana-San Diego border between Mexico and the United States. Border art can be defined as an art that is created in reference to any number of physical or imagined boundaries. This art can but is not limited to social, political, physical, emotional and/or nationalist issues. Border art is not confined to one particular medium. Border art/artists often address the forced politicization of human bodies and physical land and the arbitrary, yet incredibly harmful, separations that are created by these borders and boundaries. These artists are often \\"border crossers\\" themselves. They may cross borders of traditional art-making (through performance, video, or a combination of mediums). They may at once be artists and activists, existing in multiple social roles at once. Many border artists defy easy classifications in their artistic practice and work. Images gallery The following pictures show in how many different ways international and regional borders can be closed off, monitored, at least marked as such, or simply unremarkable.

A picnic party assembling in Columbus, Ohio, c. 1950 A picnic is a meal taken outdoors (al fresco) as part of an excursion ‚Äì ideally in scenic surroundings, such as a park, lakeside, or other place affording an interesting view, or else in conjunction with a public event such as preceding an open-air theater performance, and usually in summer. Picnics are usually meant for the late mornings or midday breakfasts, but could also be held as a luncheonette or a dinner event. Descriptions of picnics show that the idea of a meal that was jointly contributed and was enjoyed out-of-doors was essential to a picnic from the early 19th century. Picnics are often family-oriented but can also be an intimate occasion between two people or a large get together such as company picnics and church picnics. It is also sometimes combined with a cookout, usually a form of barbecue: either grilling (griddling, gridironing, or charbroiling), braising (by combining a charbroil or gridiron grill with a broth-filled pot), baking, or a combination of all of the above. On romantic and family picnics, a picnic basket and a blanket (to sit or recline on) are usually brought along. Outdoor games or some other form of entertainment are common at large picnics. In established public parks, a picnic area generally includes picnic tables and possibly other items related to eating outdoors, such as built-in grills, water faucets, garbage containers, and restrooms. Some picnics are a potluck, an entertainment at which each person contributed some dish to a common table for all to share. When the picnic is not also a cookout, the food eaten is rarely hot, instead taking the form of deli sandwiches, finger food, fresh fruit, salad, cold meats and accompanied by chilled wine or champagne or soft drinks. Etymology Hunt Picnic by Fran√ßois Lemoyne, 1723 The word comes from the French word pique-nique, whose earliest usage in print is in the 1692 edition of Tony Willis, Origines de la Langue Fran√ßaise, which mentions pique-nique as being of recent origin. The term was used to describe a group of people dining in a restaurant who brought their own wine. The concept of a picnic long retained the connotation of a meal to which everyone contributed something. According to some dictionaries, the French word pique-nique is based on the verb piquer, which means 'pick', 'peck', or 'nab', and the rhyming addition nique, which means 'thing of little importance', 'bagatelle', 'trifle',\\"picnic\\" in the American Heritage Dictionary\\"pique-nique\\" in the Tr√©sor de la langue fran√ßaise informatis√© (in French)\\"pique-nique\\" in the Dictionnaire de l'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise but for example the Oxford English Dictionary says it is of unknown origin.Oxford English Dictionary, \\"picnic\\" Picnicking was common in France after the French Revolution, when it became possible for ordinary people to visit and mingle in the country's royal parks. In 18th and 19th centuries, picnics were elaborate social events with complex meals and fancy drinks that sometimes took days to prepare. The word picnic first appeared in English in a letter from Lord Chesterfield in 1748 (OED), who associates it with card-playing, drinking, and conversation. Dictionaries agree it entered the English language as a respelling of the French word pique-nique. The practice of an elegant meal eaten out-of-doors, rather than an agricultural worker's dinner in a field, was connected with respite from hunting from the Middle Ages; the excuse for the pleasurable outing of 1723 in Fran√ßois Lemoyne's painting (illustration, left) is still offered in the context of a hunt. The claim that the word picnic derived from lynching parties has existed in Black American communities for many years. The word picnic did not begin with the lynching of black Americans, but the lynching of black people often occurred in \\"picnic-like\\" settings, with crowds in attendance eating and drinking or gathering afterward for a meal.  Related historical events  After the French Revolution in 1789, royal parks became open to the public for the first time. Picnicking in the parks became a popular activity amongst the newly enfranchised citizens. Early in the 19th century, a fashionable group of Londoners formed the 'Picnic Society'. Members met in the Pantheon on Oxford Street. Each member was expected to provide a share of the entertainment and of the refreshments with no one particular host. Interest in the society waned in the 1850s as the founders died.English picnics are described in Georgina Battiscombe (1949). English picnics. London: Harvill Press; there is also a National Trust Book of Picnics (1982). From the 1830s, Romantic American landscape painting of spectacular scenery often included a group of picnickers in the foreground. An early American illustration of the picnic is Thomas Cole's The Pic-Nic of 1846 (Brooklyn Museum of Art). In it, a guitarist serenades the genteel social group in the Hudson River Valley with the Catskills visible in the distance. Cole's well-dressed young picnickers having finished their repast, served from splint baskets on blue-and-white china, stroll about in the woodland and boat on the lake. The image of picnics as a peaceful social activity can be used for political protest, too. In this context, a picnic functions as a temporary occupation of significant public territory. A famous example of this is the Pan-European Picnic held on both sides of the Hungarian/Austrian border on 19 August 1989 as part of the struggle towards German reunification. In 2000, a 600-mile-long picnic took place from coast to coast in France to celebrate the first Bastille Day of the new Millennium.

There are several different ways to express reciprocity laws. The early reciprocity laws found in the 19th century were usually expressed in terms of a power residue symbol (p/q) generalizing the quadratic reciprocity symbol, that describes when a prime number is an nth power residue modulo another prime, and gave a relation between (p/q) and (q/p). Hilbert reformulated the reciprocity laws as saying that a product over p of Hilbert norm residue symbols (a,b/p), taking values in roots of unity, is equal to 1. Artin reformulated the reciprocity laws as a statement that the Artin symbol from ideals (or ideles) to elements of a Galois group is trivial on a certain subgroup. Several more recent generalizations express reciprocity laws using cohomology of groups or representations of adelic groups or algebraic K-groups, and their relationship with the original quadratic reciprocity law can be hard to see. Quadratic reciprocity In terms of the Legendre symbol, the law of quadratic reciprocity for positive odd primes states : \\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\frac{q}{p}\\\\right) = (-1)^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}\\\\frac{q-1}{2}}. Cubic reciprocity The law of cubic reciprocity for Eisenstein integers states that if Œ± and Œ≤ are primary (primes congruent to 2 mod 3) then :\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\Bigg)_3 = \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}\\\\Bigg)_3. Quartic reciprocity In terms of the quartic residue symbol, the law of quartic reciprocity for Gaussian integers states that if œÄ and Œ∏ are primary (congruent to 1 mod (1+i)3) Gaussian primes then :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\theta}\\\\Bigg]\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right]^{-1}= (-1)^{\\\\frac{N\\\\pi - 1}{4}\\\\frac{N\\\\theta-1}{4}}. Octic reciprocity Eisenstein reciprocity Suppose that Œ∂ is an lth root of unity for some odd prime l. The power character is the power of Œ∂ such that :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\mathfrak{p}}\\\\right)_l \\\\equiv \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N(\\\\mathfrak{p})-1}{l}} \\\\pmod {\\\\mathfrak{p}} for any prime ideal \\\\mathfrak{p} of Z[Œ∂]. It is extended to other ideals by multiplicativity. The Eisenstein reciprocity law states that : \\\\left(\\\\frac{a}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)_l=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{a}\\\\right)_l for a any rational integer coprime to l and Œ± any element of Z[Œ∂] that is coprime to a and l and congruent to a rational integer modulo (1‚ÄìŒ∂)2. Kummer reciprocity Suppose that Œ∂ is an lth root of unity for some odd regular prime l. Since l is regular, we can extend the symbol {} to ideals in a unique way such that : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}^n=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{p^n}{q}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where n is some integer prime to l such that pn is principal. The Kummer reciprocity law states that : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{q}{p}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for p and q any distinct prime ideals of Z[Œ∂] other than (1‚ÄìŒ∂). Hilbert reciprocity In terms of the Hilbert symbol, Hilbert's reciprocity law for an algebraic number field states that :\\\\prod_v (a,b)_v = 1 where the product is over all finite and infinite places. Over the rational numbers this is equivalent to the law of quadratic reciprocity. To see this take a and b to be distinct odd primes. Then Hilbert's law becomes (p,q)_\\\\infty(p,q)_2(p,q)_p(p,q)_q=1 But (p,q)p is equal to the Legendre symbol, (p,q)‚àû is 1 if one of p and q is positive and ‚Äì1 otherwise, and (p,q)2 is (‚Äì1)(p‚Äì1)(q‚Äì1)/4. So for p and q positive odd primes Hilbert's law is the law of quadratic reciprocity. Artin reciprocity In the language of ideles, the Artin reciprocity law for a finite extension L/K states that the Artin map from the idele class group CK to the abelianization Gal(L/K)ab of the Galois group vanishes on NL/K(CL), and induces an isomorphism : \\\\theta: C_K/{N_{L/K}(C_L)} \\\\to \\\\text{Gal}(L/K)^{\\\\text{ab}}. Although it is not immediately obvious, the Artin reciprocity law easily implies all the previously discovered reciprocity laws, by applying it to suitable extensions L/K. For example, in the special case when K contains the nth roots of unity and L=K[a1/n] is a Kummer extension of K, the fact that the Artin map vanishes on NL/K(CL) implies Hilbert's reciprocity law for the Hilbert symbol. Local reciprocity Hasse introduced a local analogue of the Artin reciprocity law, called the local reciprocity law. One form of it states that for a finite abelian extension of L/K of local fields, the Artin map is an isomorphism from K^{\\\\times}/N_{L/K}(L^{\\\\times}) onto the Galois group Gal(L/K) . Explicit reciprocity laws In order to get a classical style reciprocity law from the Hilbert reciprocity law Œ†(a,b)p=1, one needs to know the values of (a,b)p for p dividing n. Explicit formulas for this are sometimes called explicit reciprocity laws. Power reciprocity laws A power reciprocity law may be formulated as an analogue of the law of quadratic reciprocity in terms of the Hilbert symbols asNeukirch (1999) p.415 :\\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}}\\\\right)_n \\\\left({\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}}\\\\right)_n^{-1} = \\\\prod_{\\\\mathfrak{p}  n\\\\infty} (\\\\alpha,\\\\beta)_{\\\\mathfrak{p}} \\\\ . Rational reciprocity laws A rational reciprocity law is one stated in terms of rational integers without the use of roots of unity. Scholz's reciprocity law Shimura reciprocity Weil reciprocity law Langlands reciprocity The Langlands program includes several conjectures for general reductive algebraic groups, which for the special of the group GL1 imply the Artin reciprocity law. Yamamoto's reciprocity law Yamamoto's reciprocity law is a reciprocity law related to class numbers of quadratic number fields.

Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, Estocin was laid down on 2 April 1979, launched on 3 November 1979, and commissioned on 10 January 1981. Estocin (FFG-15) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy. The ship's motto, listed on her crest, was \\"Courage, Honor, Tenacity\\". History Estocin was sponsored by Michael John Estocin's widow, Mrs Quay Marie (Hampton) Estocin. Their three daughters served as maids of honor at the ceremonial launching and christening. =1980s= After her commissioning, Estocin was assigned to Destroyer Squadron Eight, homeported in Mayport, FL. While there, she made deployments to the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and participated in Special Operations off the Central American coast. (Public Domain USN Source.) Estocin and her crew were awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal for operations near Lebanon between 10 October and 10 November 1982. See also Multinational Force in Lebanon. Point Patience, Maryland, October 1985. 15 October 1985 Estocin ran aground near Key West, Florida. Throughout 1986, Estocin served as the Navy's testbed for the Mk-92 Fire Control System improvement project (CORT). The Mk-92 \\"CORT\\" program was a CNO Priority-1 Project, one of the only four in the entire Navy at that time. These tests had Estocin tracking and engaging a variety of surface and air targets. Fifteen SM-1 medium range missiles and nearly 1000 rounds of 76mm ammunition were fired in the course of the test cycle. By the end of 1986, Estocin had logged nearly 15,000 underway miles in support of this project. Estocin and her crew were awarded a Secretary of the Navy Letter of Commendation for operations between January and November, 1986. On 1 October 1986, Estocin officially became part of the Naval Reserve Force (NRF) reported to Naval Surface Warfare Group Four, homeported in Philadelphia, PA. Upon joining the NRF, Estocin operated primarily in the western Atlantic in support of Naval Reserve Training (NRT) and active fleet commitments. She logged frequent underway weekends devoted entirely to Selected Reserve crew training, as well as periodic underway periods of 2-week duration to enable reservists to complete their active duty training requirements. These operations took Estocin as far north as Nova Scotia and south to the Caribbean. Estocin and her crew were awarded a United States Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon for operations July to September, 1989. =1990s= Estocin was chosen to conduct a Great Lakes Cruise in 1991 in support of U.S. Navy recruiting efforts and to promote public awareness in America's heartland, through port calls to U.S. and Canadian cities on the Great Lakes. In the fall of 1991 and the spring of 1992, Estocin participated in Canadian Fleet Operations conducted with U.S. Navy and Canadian Maritime Command units in the area south of Nova Scotia. Estocin and her crew were awarded a Battle Effectiveness Award for operations in 1992. On 17 August 1992, Estocin changed homeport to Newport, RI. Estocin completed Maritime Interdiction Operations in the Caribbean and in December 1993 operated off the coast of Haiti during Operation Support Democracy. In January 1994, Estocin again changed her homeport moving to Naval Base, Norfolk, VA. Estocin was again selected for a Great Lakes Cruise in the summer of 1994. Upon completion of this cruise, she underwent a four-month drydock period to inspect and overhaul numerous shipboard systems. After completion of this drydocking, Estocin was sent in the fall of 1995 to the Caribbean in support of Counter Drug Operations. During this cruise, Estocin transited the Panama Canal to conduct Counter Drug Operations in the eastern Pacific as well. Estocin entering Hampton Roads, returning following Hurricane Felix, 1995. In 1996, after completing a work-up cycle, which included re- certification of her propulsion plant and cruise missile tactical qualification, Estocin deployed with Destroyer Squadron Eighteen in support of Operation Northern Light-Bright Horizon 96. During this fast-paced month and a half commitment, Estocin participated in a variety of maneuvering and training exercises with over 53 ships and submarines from 13 European nations. Upon her return to Norfolk, Estocin entered an availability period to prepare ship's systems for her next commitment, Joint Task Force Exercise 97-1 (JTFEX 97-1). During this exercise Estocin was the flagship for the Opposing Forces (OPFOR), whose mission was to train the deploying carrier battle group. Although composed of U.S. ships, the OPFOR simulated a variety of patrol boats found throughout the world. Successfully training the battle group, Estocin prepared for her next deployment. Assigned to Cruiser Destroyer Group Eight, Estocin deployed for Baltic Operations 97 (BALTOPS 97) in May 1997. The deployment entailed at-sea operations with ships from NATO countries as well as non-NATO countries such as Russia, Poland and Lithuania. BALTOPS 97 also included goodwill visits to former Eastern-Bloc nations. During this deployment, Estocin had the unique opportunity to become the first U.S. warship to visit two Russian ports in the same deployment, with stops in Baltiysk and Severomorsk, Russia. In addition, Estocin had the distinct privilege of hosting the Admirals of the Russian Baltic and Northern Fleets during her port calls. January 1999 found Estocin deploying for the Caribbean. Once again in support of Counter Drug Operations, Estocin set the standard in curbing the flow of drugs into the United States. After four and a half months in the Caribbean, including a cocaine seizure of over , Estocin returned home on 15 May. Estocin was underway once again at the end of June 1999 to participate in INDEX 99-2 with the Battle Group. During this exercise, Estocin simulated Opposing Forces during Harpoon, Anti Air Warfare, and Anti Submarine Warfare exercises. Estocin proved her battle readiness in all areas as she conducted multiple PACFIRES with her 76mm gun, launched two Mk 46 Torpedoes and fired three successful SM-1 engagements. After achieving her best battle readiness condition in over four years, Estocin returned to Norfolk in July to conduct a nine-week Restricted Availability (RAV). After this maintenance period and successful training cycle workups, Estocin sailed late November 1999 to support preparing the Battle Group for deployment as an Opposition Force in JTFEX 00-1.

At the completion of the JTFEX, Estocin was chosen by Commander, Second Fleet to perform a bilateral exercise with two French Navy ships, the and frigate . This exercise provided valuable training for the midshipmen embarked on Jeanne d'Arc and helped to further strengthen the strong Naval ties with this NATO ally. =2000s and decommissioning= As of 2000, Estocin was in homeport, Norfolk, VA, preparing for upcoming exercises including: a group sail under the command of Commander, Destroyer Squadron Fourteen; a UNITAS exercise with ships from the Venezuelan, Colombian, and U.S. navies; and participation with Brazilian and other nation naval units in honor of the 500th anniversary of the founding of Brazil in April 2000.

On 14 May 2001, Estocin returned to homeport in Norfolk, Virginia after a five-month deployment to the Caribbean, including again Operation UNITAS. Estocin and swapped crews in late February 2002 (with one junior officer deemed crucial to Estocin‚Äôs operation to transfer that remained with that Estocin through the crew swap). Both frigates were scheduled to decommission in 2002, but following 11 September 2001, Navy leadership decided it might be advantageous to retain one of the two short hulled frigates. Estocin had already reduced crew size nearly 40% preparing to decommission in support of a planned ship transfer to the Republic of Turkey that had been already approved by Congress. Yet, she was the more recently modernized of the two frigates which was why the Republic of Turkey was interested in that Foreign Military Sale (FMS). The U.S. changed the FMS offer to Turkey with the Former Samuel Eliot Morison at a reduced price to the original FMS offer of Estocin. Former Samuel Eliot Morison sailors were then transferred to serve on Estocin and their ship was decommissioned 11 April 2002 with the former Estocin skeleton crew. Estocin was decommissioned in Mayport, Florida and stricken a year later on 3 April 2003. She was the last short-hulled FFG operational with the US Navy.

There he worked primarily with the Huron (Wyandot people) for the rest of his life, except for a few years in France from 1629 to 1633. He learned their language and culture, writing extensively about each to aid other missionaries.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Jean de Br√©beuf In 1649, Br√©beuf and another missionary were captured when an Iroquois raid took over a Huron village (referred to in French as St. Louis). Together with Huron captives, the missionaries were ritually tortured and killed on 16 March 1649. Br√©beuf was beatified in 1925 and among eight Jesuit missionaries canonized as saints in the Catholic Church in 1930.St. Jean de Br√©beuf: Canadian Martyr Biography =Early years= Br√©beuf was born 25 March 1593 in Cond√©-sur-Vire, Normandy, France. (He was the uncle of poet Georges de Br√©beuf). He joined the Society of Jesus in 1617 at the age of 24, spending the next two years under the direction of Lancelot Marin. Between 1619 and 1621, he was a teacher at the college of Rouen. Br√©beuf was nearly expelled from the Society when he contracted tuberculosis in 1620‚Äîa severe and usually fatal illness that prevented his studying and teaching for the traditional periods. His record as a student was not particularly distinguished, but Br√©beuf was already beginning to show an aptitude for languages. Later in New France, he would teach Native American languages to missionaries and French traders. Br√©beuf was ordained as a priest at Pontoise Cathedral in February 1622. =Missionary= North American Martyrs After three years as Steward at the College of Rouen, Br√©beuf was chosen by the Provincial of France, Father Pierre Coton, to embark on the missions to New France. In June 1625, Br√©beuf arrived in Qu√©bec with Fathers Charles Lalemant and √ânemond Mass√©, together with the lay brothers Francois Charton and Gilbert Burel. He worked at the Sainte-Marie among the Hurons. For about five months Br√©beuf lived with a tribe of Montagnais, who spoke an Algonquian language. He was later assigned in 1626 to the Huron with Father Anne Nou√©e. From then on Br√©beuf worked mostly as a missionary to the Huron, who spoke an Iroquoian language. Br√©beuf briefly took up residence with the Bear Tribe at Toanch√©, but met with no success in trying to convert them to Catholicism. He was summoned to Qu√©bec because of the danger to which the entire colony was then exposed by the English. He reached Qu√©bec on 17 July 1628 after an absence of two years. On 19 July 1629, Samuel de Champlain surrendered, and the missionaries returned to France. In Rouen, Br√©beuf served as a preacher and confessor, taking his final Jesuit vows in 1630. Between 1631 and 1633, Br√©beuf worked at the College of Eu, Seine-Maritime in northern France as a steward, minister and confessor. He returned to New France in 1633, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life. Along with Antoine Daniel and Ambroise Davost, Br√©beuf chose Ihonatiria (Saint-Joseph I) as the centre for missionary activity with the Huron. At the time, the Huron suffered epidemics of new Eurasian diseases contracted from the Europeans. Their death rates were high, as they had no immunity to the diseases long endemic in Europe. They, with our hindsight, rightly blamed the Europeans for the deaths, with none of the parties understanding the causes. Called √âchon by the Hurons, Br√©beuf was personally involved with teaching. His lengthy conversations with Huron friends left him with a good knowledge of their culture and spirituality. He learned their language and taught it to other missionaries and colonists. Fellow Jesuits such as Paul Ragueneau describe his ease and adaptability to the Huron way of life. His efforts to develop a complete ethnographic record of the Huron has been described as \\"the longest and most ambitious piece of ethnographic description in all The Jesuit Relations\\". Br√©beuf tried to find parallels between the Huron religion and Christianity, so as to facilitate conversion of the Huron to the European religion. Br√©beuf was known by the Huron for his apparent shamanistic skills, especially in rainmaking. Despite his efforts to learn their ways, he considered Huron spiritual beliefs to be undeveloped and \\"foolish delusions\\"; he was determined to convert them to Christianity. Br√©beuf did not enjoy universal popularity with the Huron, as many believed he was a sorcerer. By 1640, nearly half the Huron had died of smallpox and the losses disrupted their society. Many children and elders died. With their loved ones dying before their eyes, many Huron began to listen to the words of Jesuit missionaries who, unaffected by the disease, appeared to be men of great power. Br√©beuf's progress as a missionary in achieving conversions was slow. Not until 1635 did some Huron agree to be baptized as Christians. He claimed to have made 14 converts as of 1635 and, by the next year, he claimed 86. He wrote a detailed account in 1636 of The Huron Feast of the Dead, a mass reburial of remains of loved ones after a community moved the location of its village. It was accompanied by elaborate ritual and gift-giving. In the 1940s, an archeological excavation was made at the site Br√©beuf had described, confirming many of his observations. In 1638, Br√©beuf turned over direction of the mission at Saint-Joseph I to J√©r√¥me Lalemant; he was called to become Superior at his newly founded Saint-Joseph II. In 1640, after an unsuccessful mission into Neutral Nation territory, Br√©beuf broke his collarbone. He was sent to Qu√©bec to recover, and worked there as a mission procurator. He taught the Huron, acting as confessor and advisor to the Ursulines and religious Hospitallers. On Sundays and feast days, he preached to French colonists. Br√©beuf is credited with composing the \\"Huron Carol\\", Canada's oldest Christmas song, written around 1642. He wrote the lyrics in the native language of the Huron/Wendat people. The song's melody is based on a traditional French folk song, \\"Une Jeune Pucelle\\" (A Young Maid). =Linguistic work= The educational rigor of the Jesuit seminaries prepared missionaries to acquire native languages. But, as they had learned the classical and Romance languages, they likely had difficulty with the very different conventions of the New World indigenous languages. Br√©beuf's study of the languages was also shaped by his religious training. Current Catholic theology tried to reconcile knowledge of world languages with accounts in the Bible of the tower of Babel, as this was the basis of European history. This influence can be seen in his discussion of language in his accounts collected in The Jesuit Relations. Jean de Br√©beuf's remarkable facility with language was one of the reasons he was chosen for the Huron mission in 1626. He is distinguished for his commitment to learning the Huron (Wyandot) language. People with a strong positive attitude towards the language often learn the language much more easily. Br√©beuf was widely acknowledged to have best mastered the Native oratory style, which used metaphor, circumlocution and repetition. Learning the language was still onerous, and he wrote to warn other missionaries of the difficulties. To explain the low number of converts, Br√©beuf noted that missionaries first had to master the Huron language. His commitment to this work demonstrates he understood that mutual intelligibility was vital for communicating complex and abstract religious ideas. He believed learning native languages was imperative for the Jesuit missions, but noted that it was so difficult a task that it consumed most of the priest's time. Br√©beuf felt his primary goal in his early years in New France was to learn the language. With increasing proficiency in the Wyandot language, Br√©beuf became optimistic about advancing his missionary goals. By understanding Huron religious beliefs and communicating Christian fundamentals, he could secure converts to Christianity. He realized the people would not give up all their traditional beliefs. Br√©beuf worked tirelessly to record his findings for the benefit of other missionaries. He built on the work of Recollects priests but significantly advanced the study, particularly in his representations of sounds. He discovered and reported the feature of compound words in Huron, which may have been his major linguistic contribution. This breakthrough had enormous consequences for further study, becoming the foundation for all subsequent Jesuit linguistic work. He translated Ledesma's catechism from French into Huron, and arranged to have it printed. It was the first printed text in that language (with French orthography). He also compiled a dictionary of Huron words, emphasizing translation of religious phrases such as from prayers and the Bible. =Death= Bressani map of 1657 depicts the martyrdom of Jean de Br√©beuf and Gabriel Lalemant Jean de Br√©beuf and Gabriel Lalemant stand ready for boiling water/fire \\"Baptism\\" and flaying by the Iroquois in 1649. Gravesite of Br√©beuf and Lalemant Br√©beuf was killed at St. Ignace in Huronia on 16 March 1649. He had been taken captive with Gabriel Lalemant when the Iroquois destroyed the Huron mission village at Saint-Louis. The Iroquois took the priests to the occupied village of Taenhatenteron (also known as St. Ignace), where they subjected the missionaries and native converts to ritual torture before killing them. Three priests had been killed in Mohawk country at Ossernenon in 1642 and 1646. Antoine Daniel had been killed in a similar Iroquois raid in 1648. Charles Garnier was killed by Iroquois in December 1649 in a Petun (Tobacco People) village, and Noel Chabanel was also martyred that year in the conflict between the Mohawk and other tribes. The Jesuits considered the priests' martyrdom as proof that the mission to the Native Americans was blessed by God and would be successful. Throughout the torture, Br√©beuf was reported to have been more concerned for the fate of the other Jesuits and of the captive Native converts than for himself. As part of the ritual, the Iroquois drank his blood and ate his heart, as they wanted to absorb Br√©beuf's courage in enduring the pain. The Iroquois mocked baptism by pouring boiling water over his head. The Jesuits Christophe Regnault and Paul Ragueneau provided the two accounts of the deaths of Jean de Br√©beuf and Gabriel Lalement. According to Regnault, they learned of the tortures and deaths from Huron refugee witnesses who had escaped from Saint-Ignace. Regnault went to see the bodies to verify the accounts, and his superior Rageuneau's account was based on his report. The main accounts of Br√©beuf's death come from The Jesuit Relations. Jesuit accounts of his torture emphasize his stoic nature and acceptance, claiming that he suffered silently without complaining. Potential martyrdom was a central component of the Jesuit missionary identity. Missionaries going to Canada knew they were at risk from harsh conditions, as well as from confronting alien cultures. They expected to die in the name of God; they believed the missionary life and its risks were a chance to save converts and be saved. =Relics, beatification and canonization= Statue of Jean de Br√©beuf on the site of the Martyrs' Shrine, Midland, Ontario Fathers Br√©beuf and Lalement were recovered and buried together in a Sainte Marie cemetery. Br√©beuf's relics later became important religious objects within Catholic New France. Historian Allan Greer notes that \\"his death seemed to fit the profile of a perfect martyr's end\\" and was preceded by what were considered religious signs pointing to correspondences with the Passion of Christ, which added to the significance of Br√©beuf. On 21 March 1649, Jesuit inspectors found the bodies of Br√©beuf and Lalement. In the late spring of 1649, Christophe Regnault prepared the skeletal remains of Br√©beuf and Lalemant for transportation to Qu√©bec for safekeeping. Regnault boiled away the remaining flesh and reburied it in the mission church, scraped the bones and dried them in an oven, wrapped each relic in separate silk, deposited them in two small chests, and sent them to Qu√©bec. Br√©beuf's family later donated his skull in a silver reliquary to the Catholic church orders in Qu√©bec. It was held by the women of the H√¥tel-Dieu de Qu√©bec and the Ursuline convent from 1650 until 1925, when the relics were moved to the Qu√©bec Seminary for a ceremony to celebrate Br√©beuf's beatification. According to Catholic belief, these relics provide physical access to the influence of the saint of whom they are a part. In 1652 Paul Raguenau went through the Relations and pulled out material relating to the martyrs of New France. He formalized this material in a document, to be used as the foundation of canonization proceedings, entitled Memoires touchant la mort et les vertus (des P√®res Jesuits), or the Manuscript of 1652. The religious communities in New France considered the Jesuit martyrs as imitators of previous saints in the Catholic Church. In this sense, Br√©beuf in particular, and others like him, reinforced the notion that \\"...Canada was a land of saints\\". Catherine de Saint-Augustin said that Br√©beuf appeared to her in a vision at the Qu√©bec H√¥tel-Dieu while she was in a state of \\"mystical ecstasy,\\" and he acted as her spiritual advisor. According to one account, Catherine de Saint-Augustin ground up part of Br√©beuf's relic bone and gave it in a drink to a heretical and mortally ill man. It is said that the man was cured of his disease. In another instance, in 1660‚Äì61, a possessed woman was exorcised by the aid of one of Br√©beuf's ribs, again while under the care of Catherine de Saint-Augustin. The exact circumstances of this event are disputed. Br√©beuf's relics were also used by nuns who were treating wounded Huguenot (Protestant) soldiers, and they \\"reported that his assistance [bone slivers put in soldiers' drinks] helped rescue these patients from heresy\\". Jean de Br√©beuf was canonized by Pope Pius XI on 29 June 1930, and proclaimed one of the patron saints of Canada by Pope Pius XII on 16 October 1940. A contemporary newspaper account of the canonization declares: \\"Br√©beuf, the 'Ajax of the mission', stands out among them [others made saints with him] because of his giant frame, a man of noble birth, of vigorous passions tamed by religion,\\" describing both the man and his defining drive according to formal terms of hagiography. =Modern era= Statue of Jean de Br√©beuf at Trois-Rivi√®res It is said that the modern name of the Native North American sport of lacrosse was first coined by Br√©beuf who thought that the sticks used in the game reminded him of a bishop's crosier (crosse in French, and with the feminine definite article, la crosse). He is buried in the Church of St. Joseph at the reconstructed Jesuit mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons across Highway 12 from the Martyrs' Shrine Catholic Church near Midland, Ontario. A plaque near the grave of Jean de Br√©beuf and Gabriel Lalemant was unearthed during excavations at Ste Marie in 1954. The letters read \\"P. Jean de Br√©beuf /brusle par les Iroquois /le 17 de mars l'an/1649\\" (Father Jean de Br√©beuf, burned by the Iroquois, 17 March 1652). In September 1984, Pope John Paul II prayed over Br√©beuf's skull before fully joining in an outdoor ecumenical service on the grounds of the nearby Martyrs' Shrine. The service was attended by an estimated 75,000 and mixed pre-Christian first-nation ritual with Catholic liturgy. Many Jesuit schools are named after him, such as Coll√®ge Jean-de-Br√©beuf in Montreal, Br√©beuf College School in Toronto and Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis, Indiana. St. John Brebeuf Regional Secondary School in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada and St. Jean de Brebeuf Catholic High School in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada are also named in his honour. There is a high school St-Jean de Brebeuf Catholic High School in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. There is also Eglise St-Jean de Brebeuf in Sudbury, Ontario. There is also an elementary school in Brampton, Ontario, Canada named after him; called St. Jean Brebeuf Roman Catholic Elementary School as well as one in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada called St. John Brebeuf Catholic School which is part of the St. John Brebeuf Catholic Parish. Also one French elementary school in Gatineau, Qu√©bec, called √âcole Jean-de-Br√©beuf. Also included is St. Jean Brebeuf Junior High School, located in Calgary, Alberta. The school closest to his burial site in Midland is St. Jean de Br√©beuf Catholic Elementary School in Bradford, Ontario. St. John Brebeuf Catholic School in Erin, ON, is part of St. John Brebeuf Catholic Parish, part of the Roman Catholic Diocese in Hamilton, ON. There is also a St. John Brebeuf Catholic Parish in Niles, Illinois, USA. There is also a unit at Camp Ondessonk in the Shawnee National Forest named after Jean de Br√©beuf. The Catholic camp is named for all of the North American Martyrs and those who helped them. The parish municipality of Br√©beuf, Quebec, is named after him, as is rue de Br√©beuf on the Plateau Mont- Royal in Montreal. The character of Christophe in The Orenda, a 2013 novel by Joseph Boyden, is based on Jean de Brebeuf. The novel won the 2014 Canada Reads competition, a reality show with elimination-style voting on CBC Radio. Jean de Br√©beuf is the subject of Br√©beuf and his Brethren, a blank-verse epic poem by the Canadian poet E. J. Pratt, FRSC, for which Pratt was awarded one of his three Governor General's Awards for Poetry in 1940.

Keeler, one of the best hitters of his time, was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. One of the greatest contact hitters of all time and notoriously hard to strike out, Keeler has the highest career at bats-per- strikeout ratio in MLB history: throughout his career, on average he went more than 60 at bats between individual strikeouts.AB per K career Early life William Henry O'Kelleher, Jr. (he later Americanized the name to Keeler) was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 3, 1872, the son of William O'Kelleher, Sr., a trolley switch man. He played baseball from an early age, and as a freshman served as captain of his high school team. He quit school the following year, and played semiprofessional baseball in the New York City area. Professional baseball career In 1892, he joined the minor league team in Binghamton, New York, and he was called up to the New York Giants at the end of the season. After a trip back to the minors because of an injury at the start of the 1893 season, he returned to the Giants later that year. Initially a third baseman, he later moved to the outfield. He quickly established himself as a star, and played until retiring in 1910. Keeler's advice to hitters was \\"Keep your eye clear, and hit 'em where they ain't\\"‚Äî\\"they\\" being the opposing fielders. His .385 career batting average after the 1898 season is the highest average in history at season's end for a player with more than 1,000 hits (1,147 hits).Progressive Leaders & Records for Batting average Baseball-Reference.com He compiled a .341 batting average over his career, currently 14th all time. He hit over .300 16 times in 19 seasons, and hit over .400 once. He twice led his league in batting average and three times in hits. Keeler had an amazing 206 singles during the 1898 season, a record that stood for more than 100 years until broken by Ichiro Suzuki. Additionally, Keeler had an on-base percentage of greater than .400 for seven straight seasons. When Keeler retired in 1910, he was third all-time in hits with 2,932, behind only Cap Anson and Jake Beckley. He was one of the smallest players to play the game, standing 5 feet 4¬Ω inches and weighing 140 pounds (64 kg), resulting in his nickname. Keeler was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1939. He appeared as number 75 on The Sporting News' list of the \\"100 Greatest Baseball Players\\".100 Greatest Baseball Players by The Sporting News : A Legendary List by Baseball Almanac In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Having played his last game in 1910, he was the most chronologically distant player on both Top 100 lists. 1909 baseball card of Keeler Keeler had the ability to bunt most balls pitched to him, enabling him to avoid striking out; his skill at prolonging at bats by fouling pitches off with this method was the impetus for the rule change that made a foul bunt with two strikes a strikeout. In the 1899 season for the Brooklyn Superbas, in 570 at bats, Keeler struck out only twice, setting an AB-per-K mark of 285, an MLB single-season record.AB per K single season records With Ned Hanlon's Baltimore Orioles, he perfected the \\"Baltimore chop\\", in which he would chop the ball into the ground hard enough to cause a high bounce, which enabled him to reach first base before a fielder could glove the ball and throw him out. Bill James speculated that Keeler introduced the hit and run strategy to the original Orioles and teammate John McGraw. In James' theory, Boston's Tommy McCarthy was the first manager to make wide use of the hit and run. McCarthy then taught it to John Montgomery Ward, who taught it to Keeler. In forming the powerful original Baltimore Orioles of the late 19th century, manager Ned Hanlon was given an ownership stake in the team and a free rein to form his team. In one of the most one- sided trades in baseball history, Hanlon obtained Dan Brouthers and Keeler from Brooklyn in exchange for Billy Shindle and George Treadway. Keeler and six of his teammates from the Orioles were eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame. In 1897, Keeler had a 44-game hitting streak to start the season, breaking the previous single season record of 42 set by Bill Dahlen. Keeler had a hit in his final game of the 1896 season, giving him a National League- record 45-game hitting streak. This mark was surpassed by Joe DiMaggio in 1941, who had a 56-game hitting streak. In 1978, Pete Rose tied Keeler's single season mark of 44 games. No other player in baseball has ever matched this feat. Keeler also had eight consecutive seasons with 200 hits or more, a record broken by Ichiro Suzuki in 2009.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p.46, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, In 1901, when Ban Johnson formed the American League, one of the first acts was to raid the National League and offer their stars big contracts. In 1901, Keeler received offers from six of the eight new American League clubs, including an offer from Chicago for two years at $4,300 a season ($ in current dollar terms). Keeler remained in Brooklyn and did not actually jump to the new league until 1903, when he signed with the New York Highlanders (renamed the Yankees in 1913). In 1905, Keeler set the Yankees team record for most sacrifice hits in a season with 42. He remained with the Highlanders through 1909, and played the 1910 season with the New York Giants. Keeler played in 1911 for the Eastern League's Toronto Maple Leafs, and had 43 hits in 39 games. Later life After his retirement, Keeler was a scout and coach for the Superbas and the Boston Braves, as well as Brooklyn's Federal League team, the Tip-Tops. He was wealthy after retiring as a player, and invested in mining companies, real estate, and other ventures. His real estate lost value in the post-World War I economic recession, and by the time of his death, his brothers and he had to sell their childhood home. Keeler suffered from tuberculosis and endocarditis for the last five years of his life. By late 1922, his condition had worsened and whether he would live into the new year was doubtful. Seriously ill by New Year's Eve, he heard bells and sirens in the streets when the new year arrived. Keeler sat up and said to his brother, \\"You see, the new year is here and so am I‚Äîstill.\\" He enjoyed a drink and a smoke, then said that he was ready for a long sleep. A short time later, Keeler died; he was 50.Willie Keeler Dies of Heart Disease, The New York Times (January 2, 1923). Retrieved April 30, 2013. He is buried in Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

The term generally refers to human systems such as institutions. The issues of systemic bias are dealt with extensively in the field of industrial organization economics. Systemic bias plays a part in systemic racism, a form of racism embedded as normal practice within society or an organization. It is not to be confused with the equivalent bias in non-human systems, such as measurement instruments or mathematical models used to estimate physical quantities, often called systematic bias. In human institutions Cognitive bias is inherent in the experiences, loyalties, and relationships of people in their daily lives, and new biases are constantly being discovered and addressed on both an ethical and political level. For example, the goal of affirmative action in the United States is to counter biases concerning gender, race, and ethnicity, by opening up institutional participation to people with a wider range of backgrounds, and hence a wider range of points of view. In India, the system of scheduled castes and tribes intends to address systemic bias caused by the controversial caste system, a system centered on organized discrimination based upon one's ancestry, not unlike the system that affirmative action aims to counter. Both the scheduling system and affirmative action mandate the hiring of citizens from within designated groups. However, without sufficient restrictions based upon the actual socio-economic standing of the recipients of the aid provided, these types of system can allegedly result in the unintentional institutionalization of a reversed form of the same systemic bias,Jaroff, Leon et al. (April 4, 1994) \\"Teaching Reverse Racism\\", Time Magazine which works against the goal of rendering institutional participation open to people with a wider range of backgrounds. Unconscious bias training has become common in many organizations, which may address both systemic and structural bias. Structural bias may be inherent in the practices and policies of the organization, such as hiring practices which favor social networking, or a grooming policy that disadvantages people with Afro-textured hair. Major causes The study of systemic bias as part of the field titled organizational behavior in industrial organization economics is studied in several principle modalities in both non-profit and for-profit institutions. The issue of concern is that patterns of behavior may develop within large institutions which become harmful to the productivity and viability of the larger institutions from which they develop, as well as the community they occupy. The three major categories of study for maladaptive organizational behavior and systemic bias are counterproductive work behavior, human resource mistreatment, and the amelioration of stress-inducing behavior. =Counterproductive work behavior= Counterproductive work behavior, or CWB, consists of behavior by employees that harms or intends to harm organizations and people in organizations.Spector, P. E., & Fox, S. (2005). The Stressor- Emotion Model of Counterproductive Work Behavior Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 151-174). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. =Mistreatment of human resources= There are several types of mistreatment that employees endure in organizations. Abusive supervision Abusive supervision is the extent to which a supervisor engages in a pattern of behavior that harms subordinates. Bullying Although definitions of bullying vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual.Rayner, C., & Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at Work: A Perspective From Britain and North America. In S. Fox & P. E. Spector (Eds.), Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets. (pp. 271-296). Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. Incivility Incivility consists of low-intensity discourteous and rude behavior with ambiguous intent to harm that violates norms for appropriate behavior in the workplace. Sexual harassment Sexual harassment is behavior that denigrates or mistreats an individual due to his or her gender, creates an offensive workplace, and interferes with an individual being able to do their job.Rospenda, K. M., & Richman, J. A. (2005). Harassment and discrimination. In J. Barling, E. K. Kelloway & M. R. Frone (Eds.), Handbook of work stress (pp. 149-188). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Stress Occupational stress concerns the imbalance between the demands (aspects of the job that require mental or physical effort) and resources that help cope with these demands. Examples Financial Week reported May 5, 2008 (emphasis added): Versus systematic bias The difference between the words systemic and systematic is somewhat ambiguous. \\"Systemic bias\\" and the older, more common expression \\"systematic bias\\" are often used to refer to the same thing; some users seek to draw a distinction between them, suggesting that systemic bias is most frequently associated with human systems, and related to favoritism. In engineering and computational mechanics, the word bias is sometimes used as a synonym of systematic error. In this case, the bias is referred to the result of a measurement or computation, rather than to the measurement instrument or computational method. Some authors try to draw a distinction between systemic and systematic corresponding to that between unplanned and planned, or to that between arising from the characteristics of a system and from an individual flaw. In a less formal sense, systemic biases are sometimes said to arise from the nature of the interworkings of the system, whereas systematic biases stem from a concerted effort to favor certain outcomes. Consider the difference between affirmative action (systematic) compared to racism and caste (systemic).

Travel is usually restricted, if allowed at all. House arrest is an alternative to being in a prison while awaiting trial or after sentencing. While house arrest can be applied to criminal cases when prison does not seem an appropriate measure, the term is often applied to the use of house confinement as a measure of repression by authoritarian governments against political dissidents. In these cases, the person under house arrest often does not have access to any means of communication with people outside of the home; if electronic communication is allowed, conversations may be monitored. History Judges have imposed sentences of home confinement, as an alternative to prison, as far back as the 17th century. Galileo was confined to his home following his infamous trial in 1633. Authorities often used house arrest to confine political leaders who were deposed in a coup d'√©tat, but this method was not widely used to confine numerous common criminals. This method did not become a widespread alternative to imprisonment in the United States and other western countries until the late 20th century, when newly designed electronic monitoring devices made it inexpensive and easy to manage by corrections authorities. Although Boston was using house arrest for a variety of arrangements, the first-ever court sentence of house arrest with an electronic bracelet was in 1983. Details Home detention is an alternative to imprisonment; its goals are both to reduce recidivism and to decrease the number of prisoners, thereby saving money for states and other jurisdictions. It is a corrective to mandatory sentencing laws that greatly increased the incarceration rates in the United States.Levinson, David. (2002). Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment: Volumes I-IV. SAGE Publications. p. 859. It allows eligible offenders to retain or seek employment, maintain family relationships and responsibilities and attend rehabilitative programs that contribute towards addressing the causes of their offending. The terms of house arrest can differ, but most programs allow employed offenders to continue to work, and confine them to their residence only during non-working hours. Offenders are commonly allowed to leave their home for specific purposes; examples can include visits to the probation officer or police station, religious services, education, attorney visits, court appearances, and medical appointments.Spohn, Cassia. (2008). How Do Judges Decide?: The Search for Fairness and Justice in Punishment. SAGE Publications Inc. p. 52. Many programs also allow the convict to leave their residence during regular, pre-approved times in order to carry out general household errands, such as food shopping and laundry. Offenders may have to respond to communications from a higher authority to verify that they are at home when required to be. Exceptions are often made to allow visitors to visit the offender.Mele, Christopher. (2005). Civil Penalties, Social Consequences. Routledge. p. 139. The types of house arrest vary in severity according to the requirements of the court order. A curfew may restrict an offender to their house at certain times, usually during hours of darkness. \\"Home confinement\\" or detention requires an offender to remain at home at all times, apart from the above-mentioned exceptions. The most serious level of house arrest is \\"home incarceration\\", under which an offender is restricted to their residence 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for court-approved treatment programs, court appearances, and medical appointments. In some exceptional cases, it is possible for a person to be placed under house arrest without trial or legal representation, and subject to restrictions on their associates.Jupp, James; Nieuwenhuysen, John; Dawson, Emma. (2007). Social Cohesion in Australia. Cambridge University Press. p. 183. In some countries this type of detention without trial has been criticized for breaching the offender's human right to a fair trial.\\"Q&A;: Terrorism laws\\". BBC News Online. July 3, 2006 In countries with authoritarian systems of government, the government may use such measures to stifle dissent. Using technology for enforcement In some countries, house arrest is enforced through the use of technology products or services. One method is an electronic sensor locked around the offender's ankle (technically called an ankle monitor, also referred to as a tether). The electronic sensor transmits an RF signal to a base handset. The base handset is connected to a police station or for-profit monitoring service. If the offender goes too far from their home, the violation is recorded, and the police will be notified. To discourage tampering, many ankle monitors detect attempted removal. The monitoring service is often contracted out to private companies, which assign employees to electronically monitor many convicts simultaneously. If a violation occurs the unit signals the office or officer in charge immediately, depending on the severity of the violation. The officer will either call or verify the participant's whereabouts.http://www.digitaltechnologies-2000.com/?page_id=459 The monitoring service notifies a convict's probation officer. The electronic surveillance together with frequent contact with their probation officer and checks by the security guards provides for a secure environment. Another method of ensuring house arrest compliance is achieved through the use of automated calling services that require no human contact to check on the offender. Random calls are made to the residence. The respondent's answer is recorded and compared automatically to the offender's voice pattern. Authorities are notified only if the call is not answered or if the recorded answer does not match the offender's voice pattern. Electronic monitoring is considered a highly economical alternative to the cost of imprisoning offenders. In many states or jurisdictions, the convict is often required to pay for the monitoring as part of his or her sentence.

After the Iranian Revolution she was under a 21-year ban from performing and was assumed to be under house arrest for much of the time. =Italy= In Italy, house arrest (in Italian arresti domiciliari) is a common practice of detaining suspects, as an alternative to detention in a correctional facility, and is also commonly practiced on those felons who are close to the end of their prison terms, or for those whose health condition does not allow residence in a correctional facility, except some particular cases of extremely dangerous persons. As per article 284 of the Italian Penal Procedure Code, house arrest is imposed by a judge, who orders the suspect to stay confined in his house, home, residence, private property, or any other place of cure or assistance where he/she may be housed at the moment. When necessary, the judge may also forbid any contact between the subject and any person other than those who cohabit with him/her or who assist him/her. If the subject is unable to take care of his/her life necessities or if he/she is in conditions of absolute poverty, the judge may authorize him/her to leave his/her home for the strict necessary time to take care of said needs or to exercise a job. The prosecuting authorities and law enforcement can check at any moment whether the subject, who is de facto considered in state of detention, is complying with the order; violation of house arrest terms is immediately followed by transfer to a correctional facility. House arrests cannot be applied to a subject that has been found guilty of escape within the previous five years. Notable cases: * Erich Priebke, former SS captain, condemned for war crimes (Ardeatine massacre in Rome on 24 March 1944, when 335 Italian civilians were killed by Nazi force of occupation) to life imprisonment in 1996, spent under house arrest for the last part of his life, from 1998 to 2013 (when he died age of 100). * Adriano Sofri, journalist and former far left political leader, convicted in 1997 for the murder of Police Officer Luigi Calabresi (1972), spent under house arrest, for health reasons, the period between 2005 and 2012. * Silvia Baraldini, activist of Black Liberation Army in the US (sentenced to 43 years by Federal Court under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) for conspiring to commit two armed robberies, driving a secondary getaway car during the prison break of murder convict and fellow political activist Assata Shakur, and contempt of court), transferred to Italy in 1999, spent the sentence on house arrest from 2001 to 2006, for health reasons. * Giovanni Scattone and Salvatore Ferraro, convicted for manslaughter of Marta Russo, spent a period of their sentence under house arrest and community service. =New Zealand= At sentencing, the judge may sentence an offender to home detention where they would otherwise receive a short-term prison sentence (i.e. two years or less). Home detention sentences range from 14 days and 12 months; offenders are confined to their approved residence 24 hours a day and may only leave with the permission of their probation officer. Electronic monitoring equipment is extensively used by the New Zealand Department of Corrections to ensure that convicted offenders subject to home detention remain within approved areas. This takes the form of a Global Positioning System tracker fitted to the offender's ankle and monitoring units located at their residence and place of employment. over three thousand persons were serving home detention sentences under GPS surveillance. *Phil Rudd, two-time drummer with Australian rock legends AC/DC, was sentenced to eight months' home detention at his waterfront mansion in Tauranga for charges relating to methamphetamine possession and making death threats. =Nigeria= * Shehu Shagari, President of Nigeria was placed under house arrest on December 31, 1983, following a military coup which ousted his government (see: Nigerian Second Republic). * General Muhammadu Buhari, Military Head of State was confined to his residence following the palace coup which ejected him from office. * MKO Abiola, was placed under house arrest after he declared himself the rightful winner of the 1993 presidential elections, against the wishes of the Ibrahim Babangida military junta.

They were ritually tortured and killed on various dates in the mid-17th century in Canada, in what is now southern Ontario, and in upstate New York, during the warfare between the Iroquois (particularly the Mohawk people) and the Huron. They have subsequently been canonized and venerated as martyrs by the Catholic Church. The martyrs are St. Ren√© Goupil (1642),Jesuit Relations: 28, \\"Account of Ren√© Goupil (donn√©),\\" by Father Isaac Jogues St. Isaac Jogues (1646),Jesuit Relations: 31, VIII St. Jean de Lalande (1646),Jesuit Relations vol 34, LXIV St. Antoine Daniel (1648),Jesuit Relations vol 33, LXVII St. Jean de Br√©beuf (1649),Jesuit Relations vol 35, IV St. No√´l Chabanel (1649),Jesuit Relations vol 40, LXXXIII St. Charles Garnier (1649), and St. Gabriel Lalemant (1649). Jesuit map Background Jesuit missionaries worked among the Huron (Wendat), an Iroquoian-speaking people who occupied territory in the Georgian Bay area of Central Ontario. (They were not part of the Iroquois Confederacy, initially made up of five tribes south and east of the Great Lakes.) The area of their traditional territory is called Huronia. The Huron in this area were farmers, fishermen and traders who lived in villages surrounded by defensive wooden palisades for protection.\\"Canadian Martyrs and Huronia\\", Athabasca University Sainte-Marie among the Hurons was the headquarters for the French Jesuit Mission to the Huron Wendat people.Sainte Marie among the Hurons By the late 1640s, the Jesuits believed they were making progress in their mission to the Huron, and claimed to have made many converts. But, the priests were not universally trusted. Many Huron considered them to be malevolent shamans who brought death and disease wherever they travelled; after European contact, the Huron had suffered high fatalities in epidemics after 1634 of smallpox and other Eurasian infectious diseases, to which aboriginal peoples had no immunity. (Epidemiological studies have shown the diseases were likely carried by the increased number of children immigrating after 1634 with families from cities in nations where smallpox was endemic, such as France, England and the Netherlands). The nations of the Iroquois Confederacy considered the Jesuits legitimate targets of their raids and warfare, as the missionaries were nominally allies of the Huron and French fur traders. Retaliating for French colonial attacks against the Iroquois was also a reason for their raids against the Huron and Jesuits. In 1642, the Mohawk captured Ren√© Goupil, and Father Isaac Jogues, bringing them back to their village of Ossernenon south of the Mohawk River. They ritually tortured both men and killed Goupil. After several months of captivity, Jogues was ransomed by Dutch traders and the minister Johannes Megapolensis from New Netherland (later Albany). He returned for a time to France, but then sailed back to Quebec. In 1646 he and Jean de Lalande were killed during a visit to Ossernenon intended to achieve peace between the French and the Mohawk. Other Jesuit missionaries were killed by the Mohawk and martyred in the following years: Antoine Daniel (1648),Jesuit Relations, vol 33, LXVII Jean de Br√©beuf (1649), No√´l Chabanel (1649), Charles Garnier (1649), and Gabriel Lalemant (1649). All were canonized in 1930 as the Canadian Martyrs, also known as the North American Martyrs. Legacy and honours Martyr's Shrine, Midland, Ontario The martyrs were canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1930. They are collectively the secondary patron saints of Canada. St. Ren√© Goupil, St. Isaac Jogues, and St. Jean de Lalande are the first three U.S. saints, martyred at Ossernenon, 9 miles west of the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers.

Mendoza, a lifetime .215 hitter, is best known for being the source of the name for the threshold for batting ineptitude, the \\"Mendoza Line\\", meaning a batting average of .200. Mendoza managed in the minor leagues and in Mexico after his Major League Baseball (MLB) playing career. He is a member of the Mexican League Hall of Fame. Playing career =Pittsburgh Pirates= Mendoza first caught the eye of the Pittsburgh Pirates while playing for the Mexico City Red Devils (Diablos Rojos) of the Mexican League in 1970. His ability for picking grounders prompted the Pirates to purchase Mendoza's contract from Mexico City. Mendoza played four seasons in the Pirates' farm system before debuting with the Pirates on April 26, 1974 as a pinch runner for Willie Stargell. With the Pirates down 3‚Äì2 in the ninth inning to the Houston Astros, Mendoza scored the tying run in the Pirates' 4‚Äì3 victory. For the season, Mendoza batted .221 in 91 games, but had only 177 plate appearances as he was primarily a defensive replacement when starting Pirates shortstop Frank Taveras (who himself only had a .246 batting average in 1974) had been pinch hit for late in a game. He reached the postseason for the only time in his career during his rookie season. He started game three of the 1974 National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and went one for three with a walk and an RBI infield single. On June 28, 1977, Mendoza pitched two innings of mop up duty in the second game of a doubleheader against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Pirates, having used seven pitchers in a doubleheader with the Montreal Expos two days earlier, had already used three pitchers in the first-game 6‚Äì1 loss. Completely depleted of pitchers, Pirates manager Chuck Tanner started relief pitcher Grant Jackson in the second game, pitching six innings despite giving up ten runs (only six of which were earned), and the Pirates were already down 10‚Äì3 by the time Mendoza was handed the ball. After getting Keith Hernandez to line into a double play to end his first inning of work, Mendoza gave up a three run home run to Ken Reitz the following inning, giving Mendoza a career 13.50 earned run average on the mound. Mendoza remained with the Pirates as a defensive replacement through 1978, playing some second and third base as well. In five seasons with the Pirates, Mendoza batted .221, .180, .185, .198, and .218, respectively. Following the 1978 season, Mendoza's request for a trade was granted as he, Odell Jones, and Rafael Vasquez were sent to the Seattle Mariners for Rick Jones, Tom McMillan, and Enrique Romo on December 5, 1978. =Seattle Mariners= In his first season in Seattle, Mendoza made a career-high 401 plate appearances in a career high 148 games and 132 starts at shortstop. While providing the Mariners with a steady glove, he ended the season with a .198 batting average‚Äîmaking him only the fourth major leaguer ever to play as many as 148 games in a season and fail to break .200. The following year, however, Mendoza fared better at the plate, batting .245 in 277 at-bats. =Texas Rangers= Following the season, Mendoza was sent to the Texas Rangers in a blockbuster deal along with Larry Cox, Rick Honeycutt, Willie Horton, and Leon Roberts for Brian Allard, Rick Auerbach, Ken Clay, Jerry Don Gleaton, Richie Zisk, and Steve Finch. In 1981, Mendoza split time at short with Mark Wagner with Mendoza receiving the bulk of the playing time, and finishing with a .231 batting average. However, the following season he was released in June 1982 with a .118 batting average. =Return to Mexico= Mendoza received an invitation to spring training with the Pirates in 1983. After failing to make the team, he accepted a player-coach position with their triple A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders. After one season in Hawaii, Mendoza returned to Mexico as a player/manager of the Monclova Acereros. Mendoza only managed Monclova for part of his first season back in the Mexican League, but his playing career in Mexico lasted seven seasons after his major league career ended. His career batting average in Mexico was a substantially better .291; he earned the nickname Manos de Seda, or Silk Hands, for his fielding prowess. Managerial career Bill Bavasi, an executive with the Anaheim Angels, believed Mendoza was someone who had potential as a manager and offered him the reins to the Angels' Class A advanced California League affiliate, Lake Elsinore Storm, for the 1998 season. He remained with the Storm until they became a San Diego Padres affiliate in 2001, managing his son, Mario Jr., in 2000. Mendoza was inducted into the Mexican League Hall of Fame in 2000. After managing the San Francisco Giants' double A Texas League affiliate Shreveport SwampDragons in 2002, Mendoza returned to Mexico to manage Dos Laredos in 2003, the Angelopolis Tigres in 2004, the Olmecas de Tabasco in 2005 and 2006, and the Piratas de Campeche in 2007. He was named manager of the Broncos de Reynosa during the 2012 season. He was dismissed as Reynosa's manager in May 2013 after the team started in first place with a 30-23 win-loss record; team leadership cited differences of opinion with Mendoza. \\"The Mendoza Line\\" Mendoza claims that the term was invented in 1979 by his Mariner teammates Bruce Bochte and Tom Paciorek. Bochte and Paciorek would tease Mendoza about his low batting average, as he struggled to hit .200 for the season. Although Mendoza finished his career with a batting average of .215, the Mendoza Line is almost universally accepted as being at .200, as this was the average Mendoza flirted with all that year. (From May 10 to the end of the season, Mendoza's average fluctuated between .175 and .210, usually staying within just a few points of .200 before finishing below the Mendoza Line at .198.)https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/gl.cgi?id=mendoma01&t;=b&year;=1979 The 'Mendoza Line' phrase was then overheard and used by George Brett. In an interview in 1980, during his pursuit of a .400 season batting average, Brett reportedly stated, \\"The first thing I look for in the Sunday papers is who is below the Mendoza line.\\" The reference caught the attention of ESPN announcer Chris Berman, and the \\"Mendoza Line\\" became part of popular culture. However, Brett also praised the defensive abilities of Mendoza, claiming Mendoza robbed him of sure base hits on several occasions with exceptional defensive plays.

It is one of the main towns in the Annapolis Valley, and it is the county seat of Kings County. As of 2016, the town's population was 6,271. Its census agglomeration is 26,222. History Kentville owes its location to the Cornwallis River which downstream from Kentville becomes a large tidal river. The riverbank at the future location of Kentville provided as easy fording point. The Mi'kmaq name for the location was \\"Penooek\\".C. Bruce Fergusson, \\"Kentville\\", Place-Names and Places of Nova Scotia Nova Scotia Archives (1967), p. 326. The ford and later the bridge at Kentville made the settlement an important crossroads for settlements in the Annapolis Valley. Kentville also marked the limit of navigation of sailing ships. =Acadian settlement= The area was first settled by Acadians, who built many dykes along the river to keep the high Bay of Fundy tides out of their farmland. These dykes created the ideal fertile soil that the Annapolis Valley is known for. The Acadians were expelled from the area in the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) by the British authorities because they would not swear allegiance to the British King. The area was then settled by New England Planters. Settlement was expedited by the United Empire Loyalists during the American Revolution. =English settlement= The town was originally known as Horton's Corner, but was named Kentville in 1826 after Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent (son of King George III and father of Queen Victoria), who resided in Nova Scotia from 1794 to 1800. The village was at first relatively small and dwarfed by larger valley towns with better harbours such as Canning and Wolfville. The crossroads location did attract early shopkeepers and several stagecoach inns. Small schooners were able to land cargos in the \\"Klondyke\\" neighhourhood by the Cornwallis River which marked the height of navigation.Louis V. Comeau, Historic Kentville Halifax: Nimbus Publishing (2003) p. 83 Kentville developed a reputation for rowdy drinking and horseraces in the early 19th century, earning the nickname \\"the Devil's half acre.\\" =Growth= Windsor and Annapolis Railway locomotive Gabriel in Kentville, circa 1870 When the Windsor and Annapolis Railway (later named Dominion Atlantic Railway) established its headquarters in Kentville in 1868 and began shipping Annapolis Valley apples to British markets, the community began to thrive. The railway not only employed a large number of people, up to a third of the town's population, but also attracted other industries such as mills, dairies, a large foundry, and a carriage works which even entered automobile production. A branchline of the Dominion Atlantic, the Cornwallis Valley Railway, was built north to Canning and Kingsport in 1889 furthering developing the apple industry and creating a suburban line for workers, shoppers and schoolchildren to commute to Kentville. The railway also attracted large institutional developments such as a large regional TB hospital, the Kentville Sanitorium, a federal agricultural research station, and an army training base at Camp Aldershot.\\"Kentville\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Initiative Aberdeen Street, Kentville as passenger train arrives, c. 1910 The town became a major travel centre highlighted by the large Cornwallis Inn built at the town's centre by the railway. The town boomed during World War I and World War II with heavy wartime railway traffic on the Dominion Atlantic and the training of thousands of troops at Camp Aldershot. Many residents fought overseas in the local West Nova Scotia Regiment as well as other branches of service. A Royal Canadian Navy minesweeper was named after the town, and her crew often took leave in Kentville. =Post war challenges= Kentville faced serious challenges after World War II. The dominant apple industry suffered severe declines due to the loss of its British export market. The nearby military training base at Camp Aldershot was significantly downsized and the town's major employer, the Dominion Atlantic Railway suffered serious declines with the collapse of the apple industry and the growth of highway travel. Further decline followed in the 1970s as the town lost its retail core to the growth of shopping malls and later \\"big box\\" stores in nearby New Minas. The town was also eclipsed in restaurant, upscale retail and cultural institutions by the nearby university town of Wolfville.Louis V. Comeau, Historic Kentville Halifax: Nimbus Publishing (2003) p. ix Railway passenger service ended in 1990. Freight service ended in October 1993 and the Kentville rail shops were closed and moved to Windsor, Nova Scotia.\\"Kentville\\", Dominion Atlantic Railway Digital Preservation Initiative Kentville lost many heritage buildings in the postwar period and is one of the only towns in Nova Scotia without a single designated heritage building. Major losses included the large railway station, one of the most historic in Canada which was demolished in 1990. In July 2007 the town demolished the last railway structure in town, the DAR Roundhouse, despite a province-wide protest, a move which earned the Town of Kentville a place on the \\"2008 Worst\\" List of the Heritage Canada Foundation.Heritage Canada Foundation 2008 Worst List  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Kentville recorded a population of 6,271 living in 2,743 of its 2,891 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 6,094. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Kentville's 2011 population of 6,094 people reflects a modest population growth of 4.6% which has been lower than Kings County as a whole (7.1%) but slightly higher than the provincial average (3.0%). Kentville's own population however is closely integrated with adjacent communities of Coldbrook and New Minas making for a combined population of 14,613 and forming part of the fast-growing area of eastern Kings County with an overall population of 25,969. The median household income in 2005 for Kentville was $44,164, which is below the Nova Scotia provincial average of $46,605. Industries Valley Regional HospitalDuring the early part of the 20th century Kentville emerged as the business centre of Kings County and despite the post-war loss of commerce to other valley communities, it remains the professional centre of the Annapolis Valley. Kentville is home to numerous professional services such as lawyers offices, doctors, and investment firms. On the outskirts of the town is the Valley Regional Hospital, built in 1991. The town is also home to the Annapolis Valley Regional Industrial Park which employs numerous people in the area through a variety of different businesses. Agriculture, especially fruit crops such as apples, remain a prominent industry in the Kentville area, and throughout the eastern part of the valley. Kentville is home to one of the largest agricultural research facilities in Nova Scotia founded in 1911, known to the locals as The Research Station. The site now employs over 200 people and sits on of the land at the east end of the town. Kentville shares its northern boundary along the Cornwallis River with Camp Aldershot, a military training base founded in 1904. At its peak during World War II, the camp housed approximately 7000 soldiers. Kentville native Donald Ripley wrote a book chronicling Camp Aldershot and its effect on the town entitled On The Home Front.Ripley, Donald: \\"On the Home Front: Wartime Life in Camp Aldershot and Kentville, N. S.\\" Halifax: Nimbus, 1991 Today the camp functions as an army reserve training centre and is the headquarters of The West Nova Scotia Regiment. = Electric utility (sold 1997) = Kentville until 1997-8 was one of seven Nova Scotia towns (along with Riverport, Berwick, Canso, Antigonish, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay) to own its own electricity distribution utility within town limits ‚Äì the Kentville Electric Commission. When the other six joined into the Municipal Electric Utilities of Nova Scotia in January 1998, Kentville instead sold its utility to Nova Scotia Power, a privately owned generator and distributor whose service area covered the rest of the province. Community events The Apple Blossom Festival, founded in 1933 is held each May to celebrate the blossoming of local apple industry, one of the region's richest forms of agriculture. Kentville is also well known for its Pumpkin People Festival.

The naked bulldog bat (Cheiromeles torquatus) does not belong to this family, but to the family Molossidae, the free-tailed bats. They are found near water, from Mexico to Argentina and also in the Caribbean islands. In these areas they can be found roosting in groups within hollow trees, caves, man made homes, or other openings with enough space. While the two species exhibit different social and foraging behaviors both tend to return to a main roosting spot while also visiting other alternative roosting spots. The bulldog bats have orange to brown fur, and range in head-body length from 7 to 14 cm. They have relatively long legs, large feet (exceptionally so in the case of the greater bulldog bat), and strong claws. Their wings are long and narrow and their ears are large and funnel shaped. Unusual among bats, they have cheek-pouches for storing food. They also have full lips divided by a fold of skin giving a 'hare lip' look which together with the cheek pouches gives them their bulldog-like appearance. The species of lesser bulldog bats are insectivorous, and while the greater bulldog bats also eat insects, their chief food is fish.McDonald D. ed 2010 The Encyclopedia of Mammals Oxford University Press p466 They use their echolocation to pinpoint the ripples they make on the surfaces of water. The greater bulldog bat trawls the water with its long, curved talons approximately 2‚Äì3 cm below the surface. It makes sweeps of between 30 cm and 3 m before ascending and turning to make a return sweep. In a single night, the bat may catch 20-30 small fish in this way.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press.

The community was founded as \\"Springhill Mines.\\" Coal mining lead to economic growth, with its incorporation as a town in 1889. The mines in the Springhill coalfield were established in the 19th century, and by the early 1880s were being worked by the Cumberland Coal & Railway Company Ltd. and the Springhill & Parrsboro Coal & Railway Company Ltd. These entities merged in 1884 to form the Cumberland Railway & Coal Company Ltd., which its investors sold in 1910 to the industrial conglomerate Dominion Coal Company Ltd. (DOMCO). All coal mining had ceased in the area by the early 1970s. The community is famous for both the Springhill Mining Disaster and being the childhood home of international recording star Anne Murray, who is honoured by the Anne Murray Centre, a popular tourist attraction. As of 2015 the mine properties, among the deepest in the world were filled with water and provide Springhill's industrial park with geothermal heating. Geothermal energy from the waters of the abandoned mines are capable of providing heating and cooling for large buildings through the use of heat pumps. Because the water in a mine circulates by convection, shallow wells produce water of a temperature significantly higher than groundwater of the same depth.https://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/WGC/1995/1-jessop2.pdf In 2015 the Town of Springhill amalgamated into the Municipality of the County of Cumberland.  Anne Murray Centre  The Anne Murray Centre showcases the incredible life and times of Springhill's internationally acclaimed songstress Anne Murray. Here visitors can step into the remarkable story of this Canadian icon and take an intimate look at her humble beginnings, flight to fame, and enduring contributions to the world of music. Canadian music icon Anne Murray was born and raised in Springhill, Nova Scotia. Her father, James Carson Murray, was the Springhill town doctor for many years. Her mother, Marion Margaret Murray, was a registered nurse who focused her life on raising her family and community charity work. The Dr. Carson & Marion Murray Community Centre is named after her parents and is a short distance from the Anne Murray Centre which hosts an annual summer event and fundraiser that attracts tourists from around the globe. Her musical accomplishments in pop, country, and adult contemporary music include albums selling over 55 million copies worldwide. Murray has received four Grammys, a record 24 Junos, three American Music Awards, and three Canadian Country Music Association Awards. The Anne Murray Centre in Springhill offers a mini-recording studio to record your own duet, a gift shop, memorabilia and other artifacts spanning the 40 year music career of Anne Murray. Anne Murray Centre, Springhill, NS. Nova Scotia Community College, Cumberland Campus.  Landscape and geology  All Saints Anglican Church in Springhill (demolished in 2019). It was designed by William Critchlow Harris. Springhill is located in the Cobequid Mountains sometimes referred to as the Cobequid Hills, which is a mountain range located in Nova Scotia in the mainland portion of the province. Geologically, the Cobequid Mountains are considered part of the Appalachians. The range stretches from Cape Chignecto in Cumberland County in the west through to Pictou County in the east. As a hamlet protruding from the hillsides of Cumberland County, Springhill lies tucked away in the Nova Scotia interior uplands resting between the smooth summit of the Cobequid Mountains and the Bay of Fundy. This craggy and rugged range is a long, narrow remnant of the Atlantic upland, stretching 75 miles across Cumberland County, from the head of the Bay of Fundy to the Northumberland Strait. When seen from a distance, particularly from a high altitude, the flatness of this mountainous range is notably distinct. Broad, rounded summits, ranging in altitude from 850 to 1,000 feet, merge to form a somewhat rolling surface with an average altitude closer to 900 feet.https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/file/isric/fulltext/isricu_i954_001.pdf The undulating terrain of Springhill itself is located at approximately 650 feet above sea level and occupies a total land area of only 4 square miles. The hillside terrain has divergent elevations from 400 to 650 feet with discrete panoramic views of the historic lowlands sheltered by towering pines and stands of birch. The night skies in rural upland Nova Scotia are pure, clear of smog, and brimming with stars. Some of the clearest views of Venus, Jupiter and Saturn can be viewed from high in the Cobequid Hills. Springhill is located on the northwestern edge of the Cobequid Hills midway between the Minas Basin and the Northumberland Strait. Located in the carboniferous area on the southern side of the Cumberland Coal Basin, Springhill's six main coal seams overlap. The seams, separated by strata of sandstone and shale from 11‚Äì110 metres in thickness, were once horizontal, but, because they were raised by internal earth movement, now slope sharply down into the earth. The seams dip to the northwest at an angle of thirty-five degrees. Coal mining history and legacy The first industrial coal mining in the area took place in the 1870s after a rail connection was built by the Springhill and Parrsboro Coal and Railway Company to the newly completed Intercolonial Railway at neighbouring Springhill Junction. Early growth of the coal industry in Nova Scotia was built on exports to the east coast of the United States. Coal was so prevalent in Springhill that \\"there was a time when men got coal out of their backyards; shallow pits were found everywhere. In recent years, there have been instances when a homeowner would step out of his door only to find a big gaping hole where his driveway had been. Another part of an old mine had caved in.\\"Springhill Heritage Group - Springhill Cumberland County Nova Scotia Canada Springhill mining disaster may refer to any of three Canadian mining disasters that occurred in 1891, 1956, and 1958 in different mines within the Springhill coalfield, near the town of Springhill in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. The third and final disaster in 1958 accelerated the closure of the largest mines when what was known as a \\"bump\\" occurred. The underground upheaval can be described as a bump due to a seismic jolt stemming from the collapse of one or more support pillars within a mine. A commemorative monument is prominently displayed on the main street of Springhill to honour the heroic lives of miners and their families. The statue is near to Miner's Hall, on the corner of Main and Pioneer Street. A short drive from downtown is the Springhill Coal Mining National Historic Site of Canada. This site is located at the corner of Industrial Park Drive and Memorial Crescent, Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada. Visitor's have an opportunity to tour the depths of a Springhill coal mine, hear stories of the disaster of 1891, the 1916 subterranean fire which raged through the galleries, the loss of 39 men in the 1956 explosion and the major ‚Äúbump‚Äù in 1958 which killed 75 men. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation who owned CBHT pioneered outside broadcasting in Canada with its coverage of the Springhill Mine Disaster in 1958. The Miners‚Äô Museum displays unique artifacts of the history of the town and its remarkable industrial heritage. There is a gift Shop and picnic area for tourists on the site. Springhill Mining Disasters are articulated in a number of songs, poems, books and published articles, including an Alistair MacLeod short story entitled, \\"The Vastness of the Dark\\". Blue Grass musician Bill Clifton recorded a song in 1958 called the ‚ÄúSpringhill Disaster‚Äù. The American folksinger Peggy Seeger and English folksinger Ewan MacColl composed the song \\"The Ballad of Springhill\\" about the 1958 Springhill Mining Disaster, subsequently sung by popular folk revival group Peter, Paul and Mary. In 1987, Irish rock band U2 drew attention to the disaster when they included \\"The Ballad of Springhill\\" in the playlist for their Joshua Tree Tour. U2 performed the song at fifteen concerts, and were televised live in 1988. On July 30, 2011, U2 performed the first verse of the song during the final show on their 360¬∞ Tour in Moncton, New Brunswick. Post-industrial adjustment The abrupt end of large-scale industrial coal mining presented incredible economic challenges for the region as residents struggled with massive unemployment in the 1960s. An unexpected legacy and benefit from the abandoned coal mines is being realized in the form of geothermal energy. Since their closure, the mines have filled with ground water which is heated to an average temperature of 18¬∞ C (65 ¬∞F) by the surrounding earth. Beginning in the late 1980s, this heat source has been exploited by companies located in Springhill's industrial park, situated on the land where the surface facilities of the coal mines were located, reducing winter heating bills substantially.http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/oee.nrcan.gc.ca/files/pdf/publications/infosource/pub/ici/caddet/english/pdf/R122.pdfhttp://www.imwa.info/springhill/literature/Evaluation%20of%20Geothermal%20Energy%20Potential%20in%20Springhill%20Nova%20Scotia.pdf The provincial and federal government offered economic development assistance and a federal medium-security penitentiary, the Springhill Institution, was built during the late 1960s in an effort to diversify the Springhill economy. Nova Scotia Community College, operates their Cumberland Campus in the community of Springhill and offers academic upgrading, post-secondary education courses and trades training in a number of disciplines. Other companies, such as lead‚Äìacid battery manufacturer Surrette BatterySurrette and Benjamin Heating ProductsBenjamin Heating Products, Springhill, NS, Canada continue to operate in the community. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) have a detachment in Springhill and offer services to the surrounding communities. The All Saints Springhill Hospital operated under the Nova Scotia Health Authority provides health services to Springhill and surrounding areas including Oxford, Collingwood, Southampton and Springhill Junction. Municipal governance On March 4, 2014, the town's elected council, under the leadership of Mayor Max Snow, announced the decision to give up the municipal incorporation charter for the Town of Springhill effective April 1, 2015. The council stated that the decision was arrived at because the municipality, incorporated in 1889, was facing unprecedented future financial pressures in the form of rising costs for services, salaries and pension obligations, most notably for its municipal police department. At the same time, the municipality was facing a future of decreased revenue due to declining property tax assessments while at the same time having the highest municipal property tax rate in Nova Scotia. Upon dissolution, Springhill became part of the Municipality of the County of Cumberland, comprising approximately 1/5 of the population of that municipality. The decision was criticized by some residents who alleged a lack of consultation by the town council. However, the decision was also supported by other residents as a good choice.  Springhill Fencebusters baseball Baseball and coal mining can be linked together in Nova Scotia history since the early 1900s. The development of both professional players and colliery leagues in many Nova Scotia communities came from a need for both recreation and a distraction from the hardships of life in a mining town. Baseball reinforced a cohesiveness between young and old and often brought management and laborers together. During the heyday of Nova Scotia baseball, the Famed Springhill ‚ÄúFencebusters‚Äù included many great sporting moments by pioneer players like \\"Buddy\\" Condy, Al Linkletter, Edgar ‚ÄúThe Great‚Äù Cormier, Leo MacDonald and notable pitchers like Phillip Lloyd ‚ÄúLefty‚Äù Legere.http://www.nlc- bnc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp04/mq22805.pdf This baseball tradition has been carried forward through a living history project and the coaching of Jim ‚ÄúPokey‚Äù Melanson. Following his death, a ball field was named in his honour. Cumberland Trail  Cobequid Hills (Cobequid Mountains), Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. ‚ÄúThe Great Trail‚Äù or Trans-Canada Trail System includes an arm of the Cumberland Trail stretching from ‚ÄúThe Junction‚Äù at Fisher Road passing northwest of Springhill near Lisgar and Queen Street near Springhill Lion's Park and traveling southwest toward Lagoon Road. This leg of multi-use trail travels southwest toward Parrsboro passing Newville and Gilbert Lakes. Local trails are groomed and maintained for approximately 200 kilometres between the Trans-Canada Highway and Southampton in Winter months and actively used by the Cumberland County Snowmobile Club. The Cobequid Off-Highway Vehicle Club also uses and maintains trails near Springhill, Nova Scotia. The Springhill Centennial Golf Club is located at 2770 Pleasant Valley Road. Facilities are in operation from May to October. The course offers 9-hole, par 36, 3000 yd., a large driving range, a putting green, as well as a large clubhouse that was originally a farm house. The Dr. Carson and Marion Murray Community Centre in Springhill has an arena with an NHL sized ice surface and seating capacity of 800. There are five dressing rooms, a room for officials, lobby, storage facilities, canteen with kitchen, coatroom, meeting/boardroom, walking track, 3,100 square foot common room, and a teen centre. The Naz MacDonald Walking Trail is a 1.8 km outdoor walking trail in that circles the park adjacent to the community centre. This fitness trail provides an opportunity to experience the beauty of various species of shrubs and flowers of the park.

She was named for Vice Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague (1896-1955), hero of the Battle off Samar action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where he received the Navy Cross. Clifton Sprague (FFG-16) was the first ship of that name in the US Navy. She was transferred to the Turkish Naval Forces in 1997 as TCG Gaziantep (F 490) and remains in active service. History Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, Clifton Sprague was laid down 30 July 1979, launched 16 February 1980, and commissioned 21 March 1981. Clifton Sprague was part of the forces during Operation Urgent Fury, the US led 1983 Invasion of Grenada. The frigate served as the clandestine mother ship for a pre-invasion reconnaissance team of Navy SEALs and Air Force combat controllers. Prior to D-Day on Oct. 25, the 20-man commando force twice attempted to use small boats launched from the frigate to reach a new airport under construction on Grenada's southwest coast. Their nighttime attempts to make an assessment of its military defenses and the condition of its uncompleted runway were frustrated both times by rough seas, equipment failures and bad luck. In July 1993, the guided-missile cruiser and Clifton Sprague participated in a passing exercise (PASSEX) with three Russian ships, cruiser , destroyer Admiral Kharlamov and the replenishment ship Dnester. This was noteworthy because the two navies had an adversarial relationship for decades prior to the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Clifton Sprague was part of the flotilla for Operation Uphold Democracy, the September 1995 US intervention in Haiti. She was decommissioned on 2 June 1995 at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and was stricken from the US Navy register on 4 September 1997 after being transferred to Turkey. TCG Gaziantep (F 490) She was transferred to Turkey on 27 August 1997 as that nation's TCG Gaziantep (F 490), and then immediately modified into a G-class frigate by the Turkish Naval Yard. As of 2011, she was still in active service.

With a 2016 population of 8,532, Bridgewater is the largest town in the South Shore region. Priding itself as \\"The Main Street of the South Shore,\\" Bridgewater has long been established as the primary commercial and professional service centre in the southern half of the province. The community boasts a diverse local economy, as well as larger national and international employers.  History  The town's original European settlers came from nearby Lunenburg, Riverport, and LaHave, constructing the first house as early as 1770 on the west bank of the river.https://www.bridgewater.ca/heritage/heritage-homes/built-heritage-in- bridgewater/1556-ramey-house The town was incorporated on February 13, 1899, one month after the Great Commercial Street Fire that devastated the downtown core of the community. Occurring the night of January 12, the fire is believed to have started in the basement of the music hall at the corner of present-day King and Dominion Streets, and destroyed buildings along both sides of Commercial Street for more than half a kilometre. The history of Bridgewater since that fire has been one of slow but steady growth. The town's most transformational event was the 1971 arrival of a Michelin tire factory, which eventually created more than 1,000 jobs.  Geography  Bridgewater spans the width of the LaHave River Valley and is dominated by hills that lead down to the river. Elevations range from 5 metres above sea level at the river, to nearly 110 m at the southwestern border. Like much of Southern Nova Scotia, the surrounding area is characterized by rolling drumlins formed during the last glacial period, some of which reach 150 metres above sea level. The LaHave River is traversed by two bridges in the centre of the town, as well as a 103 highway overpass and foot bridge towards the northern limits. = Neighbourhoods = The majority of the town lies on the western bank of the LaHave River. It was the area first settled, remains the most heavily populated part of the town, and was historically home to all civic amenities. The eastern bank developed rapidly in the last quarter of the 20th century with the arrival of the Bridgewater Mall, a large subdivision, and the Shore Shore Regional Hospital. Today, it is the commercial heart of the town and the centre of population growth. As of the 2011 census, the eastern side of town held 37% Bridgewater's population, up from 33% in 2006. Compared to the previous census, the population of the western side of town declined 2%, while the eastern side grew by 16%. Most neighborhood distinctions rely upon subdivision names, where they exist. While the Pinecrest Subdivision is the only large-scale residential development on the western side of the town in the last 30 years, the eastern flank has seen rapid growth, including Glen Allan and two extensive mobile home parks. Development has also spilled into the county. Hebbville has seen the development of the now older Catidian Place and the newer Botany Lane, while bordering Conquerall Bank hosts the still- growing Meadowbrook Subdivision. The Cookville area also continues to see growth in the Osprey Ridge area. With the exception of Glen Allan, most new residential developments within town limits are the result of urban infill. =Climate= Like most of eastern Canada, Bridgewater experiences a humid continental climate. The South Shore's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean does serve to moderate the climate, and the region is usually milder than most of Canada during the winter months. Nevertheless, winters are generally cold, damp, and snowy, along with frequent rain. Summers, while less extreme than inland central Canada, are warm to hot and sometimes humid, accented by occasional storms and showers. Autumn and spring are often wildly unpredictable, and snowfall in October and May is not unheard of. Because it lies inland from the ocean, Bridgewater is usually warmer than coastal Nova Scotia during the summer, reporting far fewer foggy days.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Bridgewater recorded a population of 8,532 living in 4,077 of its 4,299 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 8,241. With a land area of , it had a population density of . Statistics Canada estimated the 2019 population of the town as 8,865.https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710014201 Bridgewater is one of the few smaller centers in Nova Scotia to have experienced consistent population growth in the 20th and 21st centuries. The population boom between 1961 and 1981 reflected the arrival of Michelin in the community. However, like many communities in Nova Scotia, Bridgewater has aged considerably over the last several censuses. As of the 2016 census, the average resident age was 46.8 years, more than three years older than the province as a whole. That was down slightly from 47.0 years in 2011, but up from 44.3 in 2006. In 2016, 5.2% of residents classified themselves as immigrants, with most having arrived in Canada before 1981. 1.4% of the population listed French as their mother tongue, while 7.8% considered themselves bilingual. 2.7% provided another language as their mother tongue. 54.2% of the population was female, nearly 3% higher than the province as a whole.  Culture  While Bridgewater is known more as a center of commerce and industry, it does offer a number of cultural events. These include the annual Bridgewater Garden Party, Christmas on the LaHave, the Growing Green Sustainability Festival, and the Afterglow Art Festival. Founded in 1891, The South Shore Exhibition is the town's largest event, attracting some 50,000 people each July. Known locally as \\"The Big Ex,\\" the week-long agricultural fair hosts the International Ox Pull, bringing together teams from from the Maritimes and the Northeastern United States. The Exhibition also features a midway, carnival games, food, alcohol, animal exhibits, and musical acts. Community music has been a fixture in the town for many years, including the Bridgewater Fire Department Band, active since 1868. The South Shore Chorale, a seventy-voice mixed chorus, was founded in the 1960s, and for many years, the now-defunct Hospital Chorus and Drama Society helped to raise funds for the Dawson Memorial Hospital (later South Shore Regional Hospital) through its production of Broadway-style musicals. Art Happening was established in 2014 to create a thriving community art space in Bridgewater. Inspired by the 'Art Hive' movement in Montreal, a group of community members developed a free/low cost art building focused on creativity for people of all ages and backgrounds. Today, Art Happening is a not-for-profit organization that strives on fun classes, stress relief, and creativity in all shapes and forms. Like much of Lunenburg County, many of Bridgewater's residents trace their lineage to the Foreign Protestants who arrived in Nova Scotia 18th century. While much of that original culture has been lost, a few remnants remain. Lunenburg pudding, a type of pork sausage, is widely available, and some residents still speak in Lunenburg English, an accent featuring one of the few non-rhotic speech patterns remaining in Canada.  Education and health  The town is primarily served by Bridgewater Elementary and Junior High School, both located on York Street. Located at the northern edge of town, Park View Education Centre serves grades 10-12 and takes part in the International Baccalaureate program. Along with serving Bridgewater, it also acts as a collector school for students from the rural areas of the county. Centre Scolaire de la Rive-Sud in Cookville offers a primarily French-language education to Francophone families in the area as part of Nova Scotia's Acadian school system. The Lunenburg campus of the Nova Scotia Community College is located on High Street, sharing space with the YMCA. The town has two provincial museums, The DesBrisay and the Wile Carding Mill, as well as a central library. According to the 2016 census, of the town's population ages 25‚Äì64, 15.0% had not received a high school diploma while 61.7% had received at least some sort of post secondary degree or certificate. Both figures were slightly worse than the average for Nova Scotia (12.2% and 64.2%, respectively), but significantly better than Lunenburg County (16% and 60.3%) and neighbouring Queens County (20.2% and 51.8%). Bridgewater is served by the South Shore Regional Hospital, located on Glen Allen Drive. Inaugurated in 1988, the facility replaced the 1960s-era Dawson Memorial Hospital located on the south western side of the town. The SSRH serves as the major hospital in the county and offers most standard services.  Industry and employment  During the early 20th century, the town's economy heavily depended upon the E.D. Davison & Sons lumber mill at the location of the present-day South Shore Shopping Centre. The Acadia Marine Engine Company was also based in Bridgewater, manufacturing fishing boat and coaster engines. The Michelin tire factory opened in 1971, eventually creating more than 1,000 jobs. While Michelin continues to be the town's largest employer by a wide margin, most of economic activity is commercial and professional in nature. The second largest employer is Millennium 1 Solutions, a call-centre, and other major employers are South Shore Health, Atlantic Superstore, Sobeys, and Walmart. In 2015, the average household income was $46,835, almost $14,000 below the provincial average.https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp- pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1;=POPC&Code1;=0096&Geo2;=PR&Code2;=12&SearchText;=Bridgewater&SearchType;=Begins&SearchPR;=01&B1;=All&GeoLevel;=PR&GeoCode;=0096&TABID;=1&type;=0  Media  Bridgewater is served by CKBW-FM radio, CJHK-FM, and Lighthouse Publishing. Established in 1947, CKBW-FM has shifted its music focus several times over the past two decades, and now airs mostly contemporary pop music. CJHK-FM began operating in 2010 as a sister-station to CKBW, and airs country music. The weekly Lighthouse Now Progress Bulletin (formerly Bridgewater Bulletin) has been in publication since 1888 and had won numerous awards for its content and lay-out. Lighthouse Publishing also distributes the Lighthouse Log, a free weekend paper.  Parks and recreation  The Bridgewater Cemetery provides a park-like setting for quiet and reflection. Residents of Bridgewater enjoy a relatively extensive parks system, which the town estimates at . This, however, does not include open green space within the town, the inclusion of which would give a much higher total. The crown jewel of the parks system continues to be the Woodland Gardens, locally known at the \\"Duck Pond.\\" This park includes the DesBrisay Museum, one of the town's public swimming pools, a large pond and various trails. Shipyards Landing is a large public park located at the reclaimed site of the former Acadia Gas Engine Company. Situated on south King Street along the LaHave River, the area features berthing for boaters and kayakers, picnic and open space, and is often used as a gathering point for festivals, such as Canada Day on the LaHave. Other parks include Pinecrest and Glen Allen playgrounds, Riverview Park, King Street Court and Pijinuiskaq Park, located in the heart of the downtown. 8 kilometers of the Centennial Trail run through the town, constructed on abandoned rail lines. Older recreational facilities include the Bridgewater Memorial Arena (opened in 1949 and closed in 2015), the Curling Club, the Kinsmen Field and the Bridgewater Tennis Club. After a long period of stagnation, the 21st century has seen recreation facilities undergo a prolonged expansion. In 2008, construction began on the HB Studios Sports Centre, a $1.7 million indoor turf, track, and amenities facility located on Glen Allan Drive. In 2013, Bridgewater and Municipality of Lunenburg teamed up to construct the multi-purpose Lunenburg County Lifestyle Centre (LCLC) on North Park Street. This facility includes the Clearwater Seafoods Arena with a 1,200-person seating capacity, the Bank of Montreal Aquatic Centre, and the Margaret Hennigar Public Library. In July 2017, the town opened the South Shore Vet Doz Zone (an off-leash dog park) at Generations Active Park near HB Studios Sports Centre.  Transportation  Route 331 runs parallel to the LaHave River in Bridgewater. Provincial Highway 103 links Bridgewater with Halifax and Yarmouth via two exits, with another under construction. Trunk highways 10 and 3 meet at Bridgewater, and other provincial routes include 325 and 331. As the town continues to grow, traffic flow and congestion is of great concern. As Lunenburg County's biggest center of employment and commerce, Bridgewater also sees a large influx of daytime traffic. The town's geography and two bridge crossings within town limits can amplify traffic disruption when construction work forces the closure of one of the main routes. A public transit pilot operation began in 2017, and was made permanent in 2019 due to use exceeding expectations.Bridgewater Transit Is Here to Stay, CKBW Radio, February 26, 2019. Accessed March 6, 2019..The town's bus route runs through residential areas and popular destinations once per hour, six days per week. Feasibility studies into public transit between Bridgewater, Lunenburg and Mahone Bay have occurred but have not yet resulted in service. Bridgewater was historically connected to the rest of the province by the Nova Scotia Central Railway and later the Halifax and Southwestern Railway, with the town acting as a central hub for the South Shore region. Although passenger train service ended in 1976 and the train station burnt to the ground in 1982,https://www.bridgewater.ca/images/stories/heritage/bridgewater%20train%20station.pdf freight rail service continued until the early 1990s when Canadian National Railway abandoned the line and the tracks were removed. Rail usage declined sharply after the construction Highway 103 in the 1970s provided a faster link to the rest of the province. Historically, the LaHave River was a primary transportation route, although today it is mainly used for recreational boating. The LaHave cable ferry is the only crossing downriver from Bridgewater.  Shopping  A view from the east bank of the LaHave River midway between the two bridges. Bridgewater is known as the \\"Main Street of the South Shore\\" and attracts consumers from both Lunenburg and Queens counties. It counts four primary commercial areas. =King Street= Originally known as Commerce Street, King Street was historically Bridgewater's primary shopping destination. Today, a 1 km stretch of the street centered upon the two bridge crossings includes a variety of mostly local businesses. It is supported by street parking and the North Parkade on the banks of the LaHave River. In 2013, Bridgewater Town Council released the Downtown and Waterfront Master Plan (DWMP) to guide the development of Downtown Bridgewater over the next few decades.https://bridgewater.tracking- progress.org/downtown-revitalization/ The first phase of the project, known as Take Back The Riverbank, included three main components: the removal and replacement of existing decades-old water and sewer infrastructure below King Street, the reconstruction of the street, including the introduction of better sidewalks, curb bump outs, and street furniture, all designed to make the downtown more pedestrian friendly, and the construction of Pijinuiskaq Park along the riverbank. To enable this, the 45-year-old South Parkade was demolished. In 2016, town council granted $51,000 to the Bridgewater Facade Improvement Society. The Society invites commercial tenants or property owners in the King Street Architectural Control Area to apply for matching funding of up to $5,000 to cover improvements ranging from painting to signage to lighting, among others. =Gateway Plaza= Formerly known as Bridgewater Plaza, Gateway is the second-oldest shopping destination in Bridgewater. IGA opened here in 1960, followed by Zellers in 1967. The site has undergone extensive turn-over through the years, but continues to thrive with stores such as No Frills (at the same IGA site), Giant Tiger, the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation, and Gow's Home Hardware. Former tenants include Sobeys, KMart, ScotiaBank, Canadian Tire, and CKBW-FM =South Shore Shopping Centre & Vicinity= The South Shore Shopping Center (formerly the Bridgewater Mall) opened on May 15, 1975 and featured 42 stores. It underwent a major renovation and expansion in the late 1980s, including the addition of Eastside Plaza across LaHave Street. While it has declined in recent years, particularly since the construction of the Bridgewater SmartCentre, the mall itself still includes major tenants such as Shoppers Drug Mart, Winners, Dollarama, Rossy, Value Village, and Sobeys. Atlantic Superstore, Cineplex Entertainment and several bank branches are all located nearby. Former tenants include Zellers, Gow's Home Hardware, Dominion Food Stores, Sears, Peoples and Leons. =Bridgewater SmartCentre= Anchored by Walmart and located in Cookville, this complex opened in 2006 and includes a variety of stand-alone stores such as Canadian Tire. =The South Shore Mall= Located near the corner of Aberdeen Road and North Street, the South Shore Mall opened in 1974 and was Bridgewater's first fully enclosed shopping space. It included a movie theatre, SaveEasy, and The Metropolitan, amongst a number of other shops. After SaveEasy was replaced by a downtown Atlantic Superstore in 1995 and the Metropolitan declared bankruptcy, the South Shore Mall fell into disrepair. It was demolished in 2009, although the original steel-framing still stands in hopes of redevelopment.  Crime  While official crime statistics are not available for Bridgewater, violent crime is rare and most criminal activity stems from petty property damage and drug offenses. The 2008 murder of 12-year-old Karissa Boudreau by her mother brought both national and internationally attention to the town. The Bridgewater Police Service has moved towards a community based policing model, working closely with Neighbourhood Watch programs and local schools, as well as adding foot and bicycle patrols in areas that squad cars are unable to reach. The Bridgewater Police Service is governed by the Bridgewater Police Commission. This is made up of both political and citizen appointees. The current chair of the Board of Police Commissioners is Citizen Representative Patrick D. Cappello.

A long standing picturesque tourism destination, the town has recently enjoyed a growing reputation as a haven for entrepreneurs and business startups. The town has the fastest growing population of any municipality in Nova Scotia according to the 2016 census, experiencing 9.9% population growth.  History  The end of glaciation began 13,500 years ago and ended with the region becoming largely ice free 11,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of Palaeo-Indian settlement in the region follows rapidly after deglaciation. Several thousand years ago the territory of the province became known a part of the territory of the Mi'kmaq nation of Mi'kma'ki. Mi'kma'ki includes what is now the Maritimes, parts of Maine, Newfoundland and the Gasp√© Peninsula. The Mi'kmaq lived in an annual cycle of seasonal movement between living in dispersed interior winter camps and larger coastal communities during the summer, including many cites up and down the south shore of Nova Scotia. The town of Mahone Bay is in the traditional Mi'kmaw district of Sipekni'katik. In 1605, French colonists established the first permanent European settlement in the future Canada (and the first north of Florida) at Port Royal, founding what would become known as Acadia.Nova Scotia Archives ‚Äì An Acadian Parish Remembered . Gov.ns.ca (December 1, 2009). Retrieved on 2013-07-12. The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the region's Indigenous peoples. Buckner, P. and Reid J. (eds), The Atlantic Region to Confederation: A History, Toronto University Press. 1994. While an attempt was briefly made to found a French colony at LaHave, the effort failed and few significant Acadian communities of more a few families existed on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia during British expansion into the area. Upon the outbreak of Father Le Loutre's War, on October 5, 1749, Governor Edward Cornwallis sent Commander White with troops in the 20-gun sloop Sphinx to the Acadian town of Mirligueche and had the village destroyed.Grenier, John.

Edited by Ronald Ropkey. University of Delaware Press. 1982.p.68 In 1753, three years into Father Le Loutre's War, John Creighton and Jean- Baptiste Moreau (clergyman) led the group of Foreign Protestants stationed in Halifax to resettle Mirligu√®che, naming the new British colony Lunenburg.Lunenburg's Foreign Protestant settlers came during the same wave of immigration that produced the Pennsylvania Dutch. Mahone Bay was first settled by the British shortly after the founding Lunenburg. The first to arrive were those who lived in town of Lunenberg and had farm lots throughout the peninsula, including Mahone Bay. They arrived under the leadership of Ephraim Cook (mariner). The people who settled on the Lunenburg Peninsula, including the present-day village of Mahone Bay, were foreign protestants who were German, Swiss, and Montb√©liardais settlers.Among the settlers were the Hyson, Zwicker, Keddy, Eisenhauer/Eisner, Weinacht/Whynot, Ernst, and Veinot families. All these names can be found in the area today. The old cemetery, known as Bayview Cemetery, has some 18th-century slate gravestones engraved in German. During the French and Indian War (which included the Expulsion of the Acadians), there were nine Native and Acadian (Catholic) raids against the protestant settlers on the Lunenburg Peninsula. The French, Acadians and natives were resisting the British control over Nova Scotia and Acadia.

While they killed three people in the raid, the Mi'kmaq were unsuccessful in taking their scalps, which was the common practice for payment from the French.

To avoid capture, a crew member of Young Teazer destroyed his own ship, killing most of the crew.Archibald MecMechan. Sagas of the Sea. The town prospered with wooden shipbuilding in the 19th century. While shipbuilding decline with the arrival of steel and steam vessels, Mahone Bay became known for its boat-building. World Wars I and II brought brief revivals of shipbuilding with construction of schooners, tugboats and barges. After the war, the shipyard became known for innovative production of moulded plywood boats. Later on, Paceship Yachts and McVay Fiberglass Yachts built fibreglass sailboats, such as the Paceship 20, designed in 1970.  Today  Mahone Bay town centre The town is also known for a history of wooden boat building, it was the main industry of Mahone Bay in its earlier years. The Mahone Bay Museum explains and shows this history in detail. Until recent years the town's shipbuilding and boat-building heritage was celebrated by the \\"Mahone Bay Wooden Boat Festival\\". The view across the harbour is of three prominent churches: St James' Anglican; St John's Evangelical Lutheran; and Trinity United. It has become an iconic image of Nova Scotia, frequently photographed and featured on postcards and calendars. The town has a number of upscale shops and restaurants which almost universally are designed to appeal to the tourist trade, and sometimes shut down during the winter months. The town also has a plastics factory.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Mahone Bay recorded a population of 1,036 living in 501 of its 571 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 943. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. Government The Town of Mahone Bay is governed by a Council composed of a Mayor and six Councillors elected at-large. The mayor is David DeVenne. Day to day activities are managed by a Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) who is accountable to Council. Municipal governments in Nova Scotia are elected every four years and the most recent round of elections took place on October 15, 2016. The provincial legislation that creates and empowers the municipality is the Nova Scotia Municipal Government Act.https://nslegislature.ca/sites/default/files/legc/statutes/municipal%20government.pdf \\"Municipal Government Act\\" Municipal Council is responsible for all facets of the municipal government, including directly delivered and shared or regional services. Directly delivered services include services such fire, public works, roads, as well as the municipally owned and operated electrical and water utilities. The municipality participates in shared services, such as library services and policing. The town's municipal operating budget was $2.7 million, and the town owned electric light utility of $1.9 million and water utility of $575 thousand resulted in a total proposed budget of $5.2 million in the 2017/18 fiscal year.

Schaefer Brewing Company.The Shaefer Beer Story / The company relocated to Brooklyn in the early 20th century. It went public in 1968 with a $106 million stock offering. In order to expand capacity for regional sales and fend off competition from national brands, Schaefer began construction of a large modern brewery in Fogelsville, Pennsylvania (near Allentown) that same year. Known as the Lehigh Valley Plant, it opened in 1972. In 1974, it was expanded from its original 1,100,000 barrels-per-year capacity to 2,500,000 and then, in 1975, it expanded again to over 5,000,000 barrels. In the mid-1970s, Schaefer Beer was one of the top selling beers in the U.S., ranking as high as fifth in both the 1950 and 1970 rankings.Figures for 1970 indicate a total of 5,749,000 barrels for the F. & M. Schaefer Brewing Co., good for fifth place, but a mere one quarter of No. 1 Anheuser-Busch, Inc.'s 22,201,811, a third of No. 2 Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.'s 15,129,000, and a quarter of No. 3 Pabst Brewing Co.'s 10,517,000. Number 4 Adolph Coors Co.'s 7,277,076 barrels only gained ground on the front-runners during the decade.Though it was producing more than twice as much beer in 1980, the gap between it and the top national brands was dramatically widening. In 1981, the Schaefer family sold the company to the Stroh Brewery Company. Stroh's then took over the Allentown plant in its own bid for national market share. It operated the plant until it was absorbed by Pabst Brewing Company in 1999. When Pabst opted to become a \\"virtual brewer\\", it sold the plant to Diageo just two years later.Lehigh Valley Brewery In 2008, Diageo sold it to the Boston Brewing Company, the brewer of Samuel Adams beer. Pabst retained the license to Schaefer and today outsources a reformulated brew it labels \\"Schaefer\\" and sells in niche markets in the United States. Advertising campaigns Schaefer Beer advertising at the Double Mountain Brewery taproom in Hood River, Oregon The advertising slogan for Schaefer beer is the jingle \\"Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one.\\" An earlier advertising campaign from the 1950s asserted, \\"What do you hear in the best of circles? Schaefer, all around!\\" In Spanish, Schaefer's slogan was \\"Es la mejor, cuando se toma mas de una!\\" (\\"It is the best, when you are having more than one!\\") Schaefer had major exhibitions at both of New York City's World's Fairs, held in Flushing Meadows Park. During both the 1939 New York World's Fair and the 1964 New York World's Fair, Schaefer sponsored \\"Schaefer Center\\", a restaurant that used beer as an ingredient in many dishes. Schaefer was the official beer sponsor of the Brooklyn Dodgers from 1951 until the franchise's departure for Los Angeles following the 1957 season. During that span, one of its advertisement was featured at the top of Ebbets Field's scoreboard on the right-field wall. The letters h or the first e on the wordmark lit up depending on whether the official scorer ruled that a batter reached base on a hit or an error, respectively.Newman, Roberta J. \\"Advertising and the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947,\\" Society for American Baseball Research. Foxboro Stadium, the home stadium of the New England Patriots from 1971-2001, was originally named Schaefer Stadium after the beer company paid naming rights for the privilege, one of the earliest known examples of a stadium selling naming rights. After 12 years, the contract expired and the name was changed to Sullivan Stadium in 1983 (after the family that owned the team). During the 1970s and 1980s, Schaefer was one of the top selling beers in Puerto Rico and Guam. A large and quite famous Schaefer beer billboard was once displayed at the main entrance to the city of Bayam√≥n. Schaefer still upholds the record for being the beer with the most unit sales in Puerto Rico, 13 million cases in a year, in the year 1979-80. It became quite famous among Puerto Rican salsa fans and superstars like Frankie Ruiz, Tito Rojas, and Lalo Rodr√≠guez. References External links The F. & M.

From left to right: Chang Chun-hung, Huang Hsin- chieh, Chen Chu, Yao Chia-wen, Shih Ming-teh, Annette Lu, . The Kaohsiung Incident, also known as the Formosa Incident, the Meilidao Incident, or the Formosa Magazine incident, was a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 10 December 1979 during Taiwan's martial law period. The incident occurred when Formosa Magazine, headed by released political prisoner Shih Ming-teh and veteran opposition legislator Huang Hsin-chieh, and other opposition politicians held a demonstration commemorating Human Rights Day to promote and demand democracy in Taiwan. At that time, the Republic of China was a one-party state and the government used this protest as an excuse to arrest the main leaders of the political opposition. The Kaohsiung Incident is widely regarded as a seminal event in the post-war history of Taiwan and the watershed of the Taiwan democratization movements.Tang, Chih-Chieh (2007). Taiwanese Sociology, 13, 71-128. \\"Âã¢‰∏çÂèØÂÖçÁöÑË°ùÁ™ÅÔºöÂæûÁµêÊßãÔºèÈÅéÁ®ãÁöÑËæØË≠âÁúãÁæéÈ∫óÂ≥∂‰∫ã‰ª∂‰πãÁôºÁîü\\" The event had the effect of galvanizing the Taiwanese community into political actions and is regarded as one of the events that eventually led to democracy in Taiwan.  Background  From 1949 until the 1990s, Taiwan was effectively a one-party state under the rule of the Kuomintang (KMT). During the late 1970s many opponents of the KMT seeking democracy gradually organized themselves as an opposition camp, following the establishment of the magazine Taiwan Political Review by Kang Ning-hsiang in 1975. These opponents called themselves \\"Tangwai\\", literally meaning \\"outside the party\\".Feng, Chien-san (1995). The Dissident Media in Post-War Taiwan: From Political Magazine to \\"Underground Radio\\". Taiwan: A Radical Quarterly in Social Studies, 20, 177-234. \\"Áï∞Ë≠∞Â™íÈ´îÁöÑÂÅúÊªØËàáÊµÅËÆä‰πãÂàùÊé¢ÔºöÂæûÊîøË´ñÈõúË™åÂà∞Âú∞‰∏ãÈõªÂè∞\\" In its fifth edition on 27 December 1976 it published an article entitled \\"Two States of Mind ‚Äî An Evening Discussion with Fou Cong and Professor Liou\\" which resulted in the revocation of the publisher's license. In the 1977 election, Tangwai expanded support significantly and won more seats than ever before. The outcome of the election demonstrated the potential of Tangwai as a quasi-opposition party to the ruling KMT and laid the ground for the ensuing mass movement. On 16 December 1978, U.S. President Jimmy Carter announced that the U.S. would sever its official relationship with the Republic of China as of 1 January 1979. It was the most serious challenge to the Taiwan government since it lost its seat at the United Nations to the People's Republic of China in 1971.Chen, Fupian (2007). The development of public opinion during \\"The Formosa Arrest\\"‚ÄîWith an Analysis of the Main-stream Print Media.

Tangwai, which had won steadily expanding support, was strongly frustrated and disappointed about Chiang's decision since it suspended the only legitimate method they could use to express their opinions. Tangwai leader Huang Hsin-chieh and his comrades soon petitioned the KMT government for the restoration of elections, but were rebuffed. On 21 January 1979, the KMT arrested Yu Teng-fa, another tangwai leader, and his son with the intentional false accusation of propagandising for the Chinese Communist Party. Tangwai regarded the arrest of Yu as a signal of complete suppression and decided to make a last-ditch effort by holding radical demonstrations on the street, resulting in the escalating conflict between the conservative KMT and tangwai.Cheng, Tun-jen. 1989. Democratizing the Quasi-Leninist Regime in Taiwan. World Politics, 61(4), 471-499. In May 1979, Formosa Magazine was established by Huang Hsin-chieh aiming at consolidating tangwai membership. On 16 August 1979, the first edition was published under the title \\"Joint Promotion of the New Generation's Political Movements\\". The initial issue sold out all of its 25,000 copies, the second and third issues sold almost 100,000 copies, and the fourth issue sold more than 110,000. On 17 October 1979, a meeting of 22 Kuomintang security agencies adopted a proposal to ban the magazine after a protest from the South Korean Embassy over an article in the second issue titled \\"Unveil the Myth of the Korean Economic Miracle\\" (Êè≠ÁôºÈüìÂúãÁ∂ìÊøüÂ•áËπüÁöÑÁ•ûË©±). Tangwai held many public gatherings and protests, without official permission. The KMT response was limited, such as sending police in riot gear but not suppressing the gatherings. This low-level reaction gave tangwai confidence in its own power and it stuck to the radical approach.  Gushan Incident  The magazine's Kaohsiung service center applied for a permit to hold a human rights forum on 10 December 1979 at an indoor stadium, and after that was denied it applied for a permit to hold the event at the Rotary Park (Êâ∂Ëº™ÂÖ¨Âúí), which was also denied. In response, it was decided to hold the demonstration at the Kaohsiung headquarters. On 9 December 1979, the Kaohsiung branch of Formosa Magazine dispatched two campaign wagons to broadcast the \\"Human Rights Forum\\". The wagons were held up by police and two volunteers were arrested and beaten, which roused Tangwai and its supporters to protest at the Gushan branch of Public Security Bureau. This incident caused many outraged Tangwai members and supporters who had not planned to attend the forum the next day to do so. The event on 10 December 1979 started out as the first major Human Rights Day celebration on the island. Until that time the authorities had never allowed any public expression of discontent. Between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. that afternoon (four hours before the demonstration commemorating Human Rights Day started, and before any irregularities had taken place), the military police, the army, and the police had already taken up positions when the demonstrators arrived. When the event took place during the evening, the military police marched forward and closed in on the demonstrators, then they retreated again to their original position. This was repeated two or more times. The battalion commander explained that the purpose of this exercise was to cause panic and fear in the crowd and also to provoke anger and confusion. Political demonstrators clashed with troops sent by the KMT.  Arrests and imprisonment  The KMT authorities used the incident as an excuse to arrest virtually all well-known opposition leaders. They were held incommunicado for some two months, during which reports of severe ill- treatment filtered out of the prisons. The arrested groups were subsequently tried in three separate groups. = Lin family massacre = In February 1980 Lin Yi-hsiung, a leader of the democratic movement, was in detention and beaten severely by KMT police. His wife saw him in prison and contacted the Amnesty International Osaka office. The next day Lin's mother and twin 7-year- old daughters were stabbed to death. Lin's oldest daughter was badly wounded in his home. The authorities claimed to know nothing about it, even though his house was under 24-hour police surveillance.Roy, Denny. Taiwan: A Political History. [2003] (2003). Cornell University Press. . = Major groups = In March‚ÄìApril 1980, the eight most prominent leaders \\"The Kaohsiung Eight\\" were tried in military court and were sentenced to terms ranging from 12 years to life imprisonment. The trial was also publicized. In April‚ÄìMay 1980, another group of 33 people, \\"The Kaohsiung 33\\", who had taken part in the Human Rights Day gathering were tried in civil court and sentenced to terms ranging from two to six years. =Others= A third group of 10 people were associated with the Presbyterian Church for hiding Shih Ming-teh, who feared torture and immediate execution. Most prominent among this group was Kao Chun-ming, the general-secretary of the Presbyterian Church. Kao was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. The others received lesser sentences. Shih was given a life sentence, and his wife, Linda Gail Arrigo, a United States citizen, was deported. Fifteen of Taiwan's most important political leaders, writers and intellectuals, all associated with the Formosa Magazine, were arrested. Fifteen publications were closed down, including Meilidao (Formosa Magazine). After the event, newspapers reported that the ensuing confrontations led to civilian and police injuries. After the incident, four Tangwai participants were arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of sedition, including Huang Hsin-chieh, Yao Chia-wen, Chang Chun-hung and Lin Hung-hsuan.  News reports  Mainstream media had long been controlled by the authoritarian KMT government. The contemporary domestic newspapers were biased about the Kaohsiung Incident and framed it as a violent mass event. China Times, United Daily News, and KMT-owned Central District News also incorrectly stated that the Tangwai protesters were motivated by a pro-independence mindset. It also stated that they were working to subvert the Republic of China in cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party.Weng, Shieu-chi and Chen, Huei-min (2000).

This negative public opinion was used by the media as further proof to attack and condemn the Tangwai. The incident caused international attention around the world, which pressed the KMT government to hold an open trial on the accused. Even though there were pressures from the U.S. and reports from the international media such as New York Times, the mainstream Taiwanese media refuted what the larger international media reported as biased rumors regarding the incident.Pang, Ming-Fui (2001). The Editorials of the United Daily News toward the Magnificent Political Events during the Postwar Taiwan. The Journal of History, 18, 277-308. ‚Äú„ÄäËÅØÂêàÂ†±„ÄãÁ§æË´ñÂ∞çÂè∞ÁÅ£ÈáçÂ§ßÊîøÊ≤ª‰∫ã‰ª∂ÁöÑÁ´ãÂ†¥ËàáËßÄÈªû(1950-1995)‚Äù  Legacy  The time period experienced a rising middle class, and a more open-minded Kuomintang (KMT) ruling regime that allowed some fostering of political opposition. Taiwanese citizens were becoming weary of mainlander authority, and were eager for a more democratic society. The event turned into a series of political protests that led to public trials and arrests. It is considered a turning point for pro-democracy groups/KMT political oppositions. After the Kaohsiung incident, a decade of political struggle continued between the mainlander-controlled KMT and the other political parties. The importance of the incident is that both Taiwanese people in Taiwan as well as the overseas Taiwanese community were galvanized into political actions. The movement which grew out of the incident formed the basis for the present-day governing Democratic Progressive Party. While political opposition at the time was not yet calling for Taiwanese independence, the event called for self-determination. An overseas support network of Taiwanese organizations was also formed in North America and Europe. Virtually all leading members of the present-day democratic opposition had a role in the event, either as defendants or as defense lawyers. By 2000, DPP successfully ended KMT rule. After losing the 2008 and 2012 presidential and legislative elections to the KMT, the DPP successfully contested and won both elections in 2016. Chen Shui-bian, who was later elected to two terms as ROC president, was one of the defence lawyers, while his running mate, Annette Lu, was one of the \\"Kaohsiung Eight\\". She was sentenced to 12 years, of which she served five and a half.

The uprising broke out in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling. Although the main rebellion was suppressed by 185 AD, pockets of resistance continued and smaller rebellions emerged in later years. It took 21 years until the uprising was fully suppressed in 205 AD. The rebellion, which got its name from the colour of the cloths that the rebels wore on their heads, marked an important point in the history of Taoism due to the rebels' association with secret Taoist societies. The revolt was also used as the opening event in the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Causes A major cause of the rebellion was an agrarian crisis in the north of China. Famine, along with smaller floods along the lower course of the Yellow River, forced many farmers and former military settlers to seek employment in the south, where large landowners exploited the labour surplus to amass large fortunes. The peasants also suffered from high taxation, imposed to fund the construction of fortifications along the Silk Road and garrisons against foreign infiltration and invasion. The strain led to landowners, landless peasants and unemployed veterans forming armed bands (around 170) and eventually private armies. At the same time, the Han central government was weakening internally. The power of the landowners had become a longstanding problem, but in the run-up to the rebellion, the court eunuchs in particular gained considerably in influence over the emperor, which they abused to enrich themselves. Ten of the most powerful eunuchs formed a group known as the Ten Attendants, and Emperor Ling referred to one of them (Zhang Rang) as his \\"foster father\\". The government was widely regarded as corrupt and incapable and the famines and floods were seen as an indication that a decadent emperor had lost his Mandate of Heaven. Political discontent, as well as droughts and plagues, fueled public resentment against the Han government. The Taoist sect of Zhang Jue took advantage of public sentiment to further their plans for a new beginning. Zhang Jue sent disciples out to gain support and organize followers throughout north China in preparation for a revolt. The rebels even had allies in the imperial court, and most government officials were either ignorant of their intentions or intimidated by their power. Zhang Jue intended to launch an uprising throughout the Han Empire, but the plan was betrayed before he was ready. Rebel sympathizers in Luoyang were arrested and executed, and the revolt in the provinces had to begin ahead of time, in the second month of 184. Despite the inevitable lack of co-ordination and overall preparation, tens of thousands of men rose in rebellion. Government offices were plundered and destroyed and the imperial armies were immediately forced on the defensive. The rebels =Founders= The rebellion was led by Zhang Jue (also referred to as Zhang Jiao, known to his followers as the \\"General of Heaven\\") and his two younger brothers Zhang Bao (ÂºµÂØ∂) and Zhang Liang (ÂºµÊ¢Å), who were born in Julu Commandery. The brothers had founded a Taoist religious sect in present-day Shandong. They were healers, usually accepting patients pro bono who could not afford to pay them. The brothers saw how the local government abused the peasants through harsh labour and heavy taxes, leaving them overburdened and hungry. =Taoist sect= The rebels were the first followers of the Way of Supreme Peace () and venerated the deity Huang‚ÄìLao, who according to Zhang Jue, had given him a sacred book called the Crucial Keys to the Way of Peace () based on the Taipingjing. Zhang Jue, who was said to be a sorcerer, called himself the \\"Great Teacher\\" (Â§ßË≥¢ËâØÂ∏´). When the rebellion was proclaimed, Zhang Jue created a 16-word slogan: Since all the three brothers were healers, they easily spread the slogan among the peasants through their patients.(ÂàùÔºåÈâÖÈπøÂºµËßíËá™Á®±„ÄåÂ§ßË≥¢ËâØÂ∏´„ÄçÔºåÂ•â‰∫ãÈªÉËÄÅÈÅìÔºåÁïúÈ§äÂºüÂ≠êÔºåË∑™ÊãúÈ¶ñÈÅéÔºåÁ¨¶Ê∞¥ÂííË™™‰ª•ÁôÇÁóÖÔºåÁóÖËÄÖÈ†óÊÑàÔºåÁôæÂßì‰ø°Âêë‰πã„ÄÇËßíÂõ†ÈÅ£ÂºüÂ≠êÂÖ´‰∫∫‰ΩøÊñºÂõõÊñπÔºå‰ª•ÂñÑÈÅìÊïôÂåñÂ§©‰∏ãÔºåËΩâÁõ∏Ë™ëÊÉë„ÄÇÂçÅÈ§òÂπ¥ÈñíÔºåÁúæÂæíÊï∏ÂçÅËê¨ÔºåÈÄ£ÁµêÈÉ°ÂúãÔºåËá™Èùí„ÄÅÂæê„ÄÅÂπΩ„ÄÅÂÜÄ„ÄÅËçä„ÄÅÊ•ä„ÄÅÂÖó„ÄÅË±´ÂÖ´Â∑û‰πã‰∫∫ÔºåËé´‰∏çÁï¢Êáâ„ÄÇÈÅÇÁΩÆ‰∏âÂçÅÂÖ≠Êñπ„ÄÇÊñπÁå∂Â∞áËªçËôü‰πü„ÄÇÂ§ßÊñπËê¨È§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∞èÊñπÂÖ≠‰∏ÉÂçÉÔºåÂêÑÁ´ãÊ∏†Â∏•„ÄÇË®õË®Ä„ÄåËíºÂ§©Â∑≤Ê≠ªÔºåÈªÉÂ§©Áï∂Á´ãÔºåÊ≠≤Âú®Áî≤Â≠êÔºåÂ§©‰∏ãÂ§ßÂêâ„Äç„ÄÇ‰ª•ÁôΩÂúüÊõ∏‰∫¨ÂüéÂØ∫ÈñÄÂèäÂ∑ûÈÉ°ÂÆòÂ∫úÔºåÁöÜ‰Ωú„ÄåÁî≤Â≠ê„ÄçÂ≠ó„ÄÇ) Houhanshu vol. 71. =Religious practices= Zhang Jue used a form of Taoism to cure the sick by confession of sins and by faith healing. The religion and the politics of the Zhang brothers were based on belief in an apocalyptic change in the order of the world. They told their followers that in the jiazi year, the beginning of the new sexagenary cycle, the sky would become yellow, and that under this new heaven the rule of the Han dynasty would end and a new era of government begin. The characters jiazi became a symbol of the coming change and, later, when the followers of Zhang Jue went to battle they wore a yellow cloth bound about their heads as a badge. From this came the term Yellow Turbans.Generals of the South, Rafe de Crespigny (pp. 85‚Äì92) Nearly all of the religious practices of the sect were communal activities (e.g. collective trances, fasts). A typical worship service consisted largely of music and chanting, the burning of incense, and sermons or anecdotes that could be given by any member of the congregation including women and those perceived as barbarians. Several Xiongnu leaders such as Yufuluo are known to have at least lent their support to the sect and a number of scholars have theorised that Zhang Jue may have derived some of his teachings from shamanism as he appeared as a mystical healer with a direct link to the heavens. While many of the beliefs of the early Path of Supreme Peace have been lost, it is very likely that they had some relation to the Way of the Celestial Masters, considering Zhang Jue claimed to be a descendant of Zhang Daoling. Many of the writings found in the 52 surviving chapters of the Taiping Jing that are found in the Daozang have a direct relationship to the Way of the Celestial Masters. Regardless, it is quite likely that any discrepancies found within the Way were suppressed by later Taoist sects. Zhang Jue's plans for rebellion Before the rebellion started, Zhang Jue had sent Ma Yuanyi (È¶¨ÂÖÉÁæ©) to recruit followers from Jing and Yang provinces and gather them in Ye. As Ma Yuanyi frequently traveled to Luoyang, the Han imperial capital, he managed to build connections with Feng Xu (Â∞ÅË´ù) and Xu Feng (ÂæêÂ•â), two members of the influential eunuch faction in the imperial court, and convince them to secretly collaborate with Zhang Jue. They set 3 April 184 as the date for the rebellion, but before the plans was set in motion, the Yellow Turbans were betrayed. One of the founders of \\"The Way of Peace\\" movement, Tang Zhou (ÂîêÂë®) had been left out of the Zhang brothers' further plans, so he reported Ma Yuanyi to the authorities.

Liu Bei fled south to join Liu Biao, while Gong Du and the remaining rebels dispersed.([Âª∫ÂÆâÂÖ≠Âπ¥]‰πùÊúàÔºåÂÖ¨ÈÇÑË®±„ÄÇÁ¥π‰πãÊú™Á†¥‰πüÔºå‰ΩøÂäâÂÇôÁï•Ê±ùÂçóÔºåÊ±ùÂçóË≥äÂÖ±ÈÉΩÁ≠âÊáâ‰πã„ÄÇÈÅ£Ëî°ÊèöÊìäÈÉΩÔºå‰∏çÂà©ÔºåÁÇ∫ÈÉΩÊâÄÁ†¥„ÄÇÂÖ¨ÂçóÂæÅÂÇô„ÄÇÂÇôËÅûÂÖ¨Ëá™Ë°åÔºåËµ∞Â•îÂäâË°®ÔºåÈÉΩÁ≠âÁöÜÊï£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 1. =Yang and Jiao provinces= Another Yellow Turban remnant force led by Wu Huan (Âê≥Ê°ì) was active in Kuaiji Commandery (around present-day Shaoxing, Zhejiang) until Liu Zan defeated and killed Wu Huan.(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÁïôË¥äÂ≠óÊ≠£ÊòéÔºåÊúÉÁ®ΩÈï∑Â±±‰∫∫„ÄÇÂ∞ëÁÇ∫ÈÉ°ÂêèÔºåËàáÈªÉÂ∑æË≥äÂ∏•Âê≥Ê°ìÊà∞ÔºåÊâãÊñ¨ÂæóÊ°ì„ÄÇË¥ä‰∏ÄË∂≥Ë¢´ÂâµÔºåÈÅÇÂ±à‰∏ç‰º∏„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 64.

Aftermath and impact The Han armies gained victory at high cost. Over wide areas, government offices had been destroyed, officials had been killed, and whole districts were cut off from the writ of the central government. Rebel deaths numbered in the hundreds of thousands, while many non-combatants had been left homeless or destitute by the wars, and the economy and society over great parts of this most populous region of the empire were left in ruins and without resources. Unrest remained and bandits appeared in every district; the Han government, in no position to put down all the lesser disturbances, was forced to patch up the situation as best it could. A long period of consolidation was needed to restore some measure of peace and prosperity, but that breathing space was not given. While the rebellion was eventually defeated, the military leaders and local administrators gained self-governing powers in the process. This hastened the collapse of the Han dynasty in 220. After Emperor Ling died in 189, a power struggle between He Jin and the eunuchs culminated in He Jin's assassination on 22 September 189. He Jin's chief ally, Yuan Shao, retaliated by setting the palace on fire and slaughtering the eunuchs. Finally, the warlord Dong Zhuo was able to gain control over the underage heir to the throne which he used as a legitimization for occupying the capital, which was ransacked on the occasion. Because of his cruelty, Dong Zhuo was murdered in 192, setting the stage for Cao Cao's rise to power. Despite the negative manner in which the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms describes the Yellow Turban Rebellion, many subsequent peasant uprisings in China drew inspiration from the Yellow Turban Rebellion and even claimed to be its spiritual successors.

Many fictional Yellow Turban figures were created for the novel, including: * Du Yuan, killed by Liao Hua for kidnapping Liu Bei's wives. * Zhou Cang, Guan Yu's rebel-turned-weapon bearer. * Gao Sheng, a subordinate of Zhang Bao. * Cheng Yuanzhi, defeated by Liu Bei's forces in their first engagement. * Deng Mao, Cheng Yuanzhi's champion. * Bian Xi, an eventual servant of Cao Cao who tried and failed to kill Guan Yu. Though not a fictional character, Liao Hua was presented in the novel as having been a Yellow Turban rebel in his earlier days; this is historically unlikely, given his date of death and predicted lifespan. In popular culture The rebellion also appears as an early stage in each iteration of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game franchise, remaining largely unchanged throughout the series. It is also featured in Total War: Three Kingdoms as playable factions in the Yellow turban dlc led by He Yi, Gong Du, and Huang Shao, and in the mandate of heaven dlc led by Zhang Jue, Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang.

Biography Nasmyth was born in Edinburgh on 9 September 1758. Endnote: For an account of the Nasmyth family see James Nasmyth‚Äôs Autobiography (1883) He studied at the Royal High School and the Trustees‚Äô Academy and was apprenticed to a coachbuilder. Aged sixteen, he was taken to London by portrait painter Allan Ramsay where he worked on subordinate parts of Ramsay's works. Nasmyth returned to Edinburgh in 1778, where he worked as a portrait painter. Offered a loan by Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, Nasmyth left in 1782 for Italy, where he remained two years furthering his studies. In Italy he devoted most of his attention to landscape painting, and is recorded as having copied a work by Claude Lorrain.Macmillan 1986, p.142. Macmillan suggests that his interest in Classical landscape painting may have been due to the example of the Scottish artist Jacob More, then resident in Rome. Nasmyth returned to Scotland where for the next few years he continued his career as a portraitist. He painted some works in the style of Ramsay, but most were conversation pieces with outdoor settings.Macmillan 1986, p.142 His portrait of Robert Burns, who became a close friend, is now in the Scottish National Gallery. Eventually, Nasmyth's strong Liberal opinions offended many of his aristocratic patrons in a politically charged Edinburgh, leading to a falling off in commissions for portraits, and in 1792 he completely abandoned the genre, turning instead to landscape painting. He also began painting scenery for theatres, an activity he continued for the next thirty years, and in 1796 painted a panorama.Macmillan 1986, p.144 View of the City of Edinburgh, Yale Center for British Art His landscapes are all of actual places, and architecture is usually an important element.Macmillan 1986, p.141 Some works were painted to illustrate the effects that new buildings would have on an area, such as Inverary from the Sea, painted for the Duke of Argyll to show the setting a proposed lighthouse.Macmillan 1986, p.145 Nasmyth had a great interest in engineering, and proposed several ideas that were later widely used, although he never patented any of them. In October 1788, when Patrick Miller sailed the world's first successful steamship, designed by William Symington, on Dalswinton Loch, Nasmyth was one of the crew. He was employed by members of the Scottish nobility in the improvement and beautification of their estates. He designed the circular temple covering St Bernard's Well by the Water of Leith (1789), and bridges at Almondell, West Lothian, and Tongland, Kirkcudbrightshire. In 1815 he was one of those invited to submit proposals for the expansion of Edinburgh New Town.Macmillan 1986, p.142. Nasmyth set up a drawing school and \\"instilled a whole generation with the importance of drawing as a tool of empirical investigation\\"; his pupils included David Wilkie, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield and John Thomson of Duddingston; and it was probably from him that John James Ruskin (father of John Ruskin) learned to paint as a schoolboy in Edinburgh in the later 1790s. Another successful pupil was the painter, teacher, art dealer and connoisseur Andrew Wilson, who had his first art training under Nasmyth. Nasmyth was not only the tutor to the polymath Mary Somerville but he also introduced her to the leading intellectuals in Edinburgh. Nasmyth died at home, 47 York Place (roughly opposite the house of Sir Henry Raeburn) in Edinburgh. He was buried in St Cuthbert's Churchyard at the west end of Princes Street. Family He married the daughter of Sir James Foulis, 5th Baronet of Colinton.Grant's Old and New Edinburgh vol.III Nasmyth's six daughters all became notable artists. His daughters were Jane, Barbara, Margaret, Elizabeth, Anne and Charlotte. His eldest son, Patrick Nasmyth, studied under his father, then went to London and attracted attention as a landscapist. Another son, James Nasmyth, invented the steam hammer.

Snyder is a fictional character in the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, played by Armin Shimerman. Shimerman originally auditioned for the role of Principal Flutie, but lost that role to Ken Lerner.Sprinder, Matt & Stokes, Mike, \\"Head of the Class\\", from Buffy the Vampire Slayer magazine #12 (UK, September 2000), page 18. Although his full name is never revealed in the series, his desk name-display revealed that the first letter of his first name is R. Summary After Robert Flutie is eaten alive by \\"the Pack\\" (with the exception of Xander), Snyder replaces him as the principal of Sunnydale High. A strict disciplinarian with a dictator-like personality, he has few friends among the students, except the swim team. Despite or because of his view of adolescents as hormone-ridden pests, he follows his profession out of a sense of civic duty (\\"When She Was Bad\\"). Snyder takes an immediate and profound dislike to Buffy, and seeks out any excuse to expel her. He coerces students into serving as chaperones for young children on Halloween, bullies Willow into tutoring Percy and makes her give a passing grade to a swim team member who is failing computer class, and forces everyone to sell candy for the marching band. Snyder (along with Police Chief Bob Munroe) turns out to be one of the many people Mayor Richard Wilkins had put in place to cover up supernatural activities in Sunnydale (\\"School Hard\\", \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\"), and he was hostile towards Buffy because Wilkins had so ordered him. According to the later episode, Snyder was specifically chosen as principal because the authorities believed he was uniquely suited for the job's equally unique pressures, but precisely what in Snyder's past might have so qualified him was never discussed. The only insight into Snyder's past was his Band Candy-induced regression to adolescence, where he is a socially inept geek without an obvious understanding of the supernatural. Snyder finally expels Buffy when she is found beside Kendra's body in the season two finale. He refuses to allow her to return even after Buffy is cleared of all charges, citing Buffy's poor grades, spotty attendance record, and \\"tingling pleasure\\" that he is finally rid of her. However, the school board, as well as physical and professional threats from Rupert Giles, force him to allow Buffy to return. Snyder's stern belief in imposing order and discipline proves to be his undoing in the season three finale, \\"Graduation Day\\". He loudly scolds Mayor Wilkins for turning into the gigantic, snakelike demon Olvikan following his keynote speech at the 1999 high school graduation. Olvikan swallows Snyder whole. Snyder makes one more appearance in the role of Colonel Kurtz in Xander's Apocalypse Now-themed dream in the season four finale \\"Restless\\". Four years later, after Sunnydale High School is rebuilt, Robin Wood succeeded Snyder as the school's principal. Even three and a half years after Snyder's death, Willow says Wood is so much cooler than Snyder, indicating she still dislikes him.

The Tswana language is a member of Sotho-Tswana language group which belongs to the Bantu language family group. Both Northern Sotho and Sesotho derive from the Setswana language and the people speaking these languages are an offshoot of the Tswana people. Ethnic Tswana made up approximately 85% of the population of Botswana in 2011. The Tswana are the native people of south-western Botswana, Gauteng, North West and some parts of Northern Cape provinces of South Africa where the majority of the Tswana live. History =Early history of Batswana= 18th Century Tswana Warrior The Batswana are descended mainly from Bantu-speaking tribes who migrated southward of Africa around 600 AD, living in tribal enclaves as farmers and herders. Several Iron Age cultures flourished from around 900 AD, including the Toutswemogala Hill Iron Age settlement. The Toutswe were based in the eastern region of what is now Botswana, relying on Tswana cattle breed held in kraals as their source of wealth. The arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana- speakers who came to control the region (from the Vaal River to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold and rhinoceros horn. Members of the Bakwena, a chieftaincy under a legendary leader named Kgabo II, made their way into the southern Kalahari by AD 1500, at the latest, and his people drove the Bakgalagadi inhabitants west into the desert. Over the years, several offshoots of the Bakwena moved into adjoining territories. The Bangwaketse occupied areas to the west, while the Bangwato moved northeast into formerly Bakalanga areas. Not long afterwards, a Bangwato offshoot known as the Batawana migrated into the Okavango Delta, probably in the 1790s. The first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. One of these famous capitals was Kaditshwene which was the cultural capital of the Bahurutshe people, one of the principal Tswana tribes and a centre of manufacturing and trading, it had been founded in the late 1400s on the site of iron and copper ore deposits. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823-1843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo (Sotho-Tswana speaking Clan) in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and amaNdebele raided repeatedly, and stole large numbers of cattle from the Batswana‚Äîmost of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside. Homestead in the ancient City of left According to all historical narratives to date, Barotseland, or rather the Luyi state or nation, was invaded sometime between 1820 and 1840 by a branch of Sotho-Tswana peoples that the Luyi originally referred to as the Akubu, later known as the Makololo led by their warrior charismatic leader, Sibituane a wise military strategist, occupying it and imposing their will for over thirty years, until they were overthrown in 1864. The Makololo were in fact the Bafokeng Basotho(Mixture of Sotho and Tswana) people that moved from the then Orange Free State area through modern day Botswana upnorth to the present day southern Zambia. From the 1820s to the 1860s, the name Makololo inspired a combination of fear, horror and reverence amongst peoples of the Kalahari between the Orange and Zambezi Rivers. The name Makololo only came about during the long migration north. One version has it that the name came about after Sibituane took a wife named Setlutlu of the Batlokoa (Tswana Clan), who he had previously awarded to Lechae, one of his young commanders but who he was particularly enamoured with himself. Sibituane was renowned for his military capabilities and his leadership qualities. The very fact of so many victories for Sibituane over peoples who would have strongly resisted the transit of strangers through their lands suggests remarkable abilities. This led to considerable respect for Sibituane and the Makololo system of rule. In truth it was no contest and after a few battles the Lozi forces were completely routed although total subjugation of Barotseland took around five years to complete. Sibituane made his capital at Naliele but moved south again to Linyanti (present day Sangwali) in Caprivi where he met Livingstone and Oswell in 1851.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271812285_In_Search_of_Kaditshwene =Batswana‚ÄìBoer Wars= An 1865 Portrait of Kgosi Sechele I in Ntsweng Bechuanaland During the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the Batswapong and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions which culminated with the pivotal showdown of the Battle of Dimawe fought with artillery and long range rifles as well as musket fire. Although it was the Boer Commando led by the Boer Commandant-General Pieter Scholtz and Paul Kruger, as an officer leading the Boer advance who started the offensive, it was they who ended up on the retreat followed by Batswana's retaliatory attacks into the then Transvaal's Marique district in which Boer settlements, villages and farms were scotched. After about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully. =Battle of Khutiyabasadi= The Batawana's (Tswana tribe/clan) fight against invading Ndebele of 1884. When the amaNdebele arrived at Toteng, they thus found the village abandoned. But, as they settled down to enjoy their bloodless conquest, about seventy mounted Batawana under Kgosi Moremi's personal command appeared, all armed with breech-loading rifles. In classic commando style the cavalry began to harass the much larger enemy force with lethal hit and run volleys. Meanwhile, another group of traditionally armed subjects of the Kgosi also made their presence known. At this point the amaNdebele commander, Lotshe, took the bait dividing his army into two groups. One party pursued Moremi's small force, while the other fruitlessly tried to catch up to what they believed was the main body of Batawana. As the invaders generally lacked guns, as well as horses, Moremi continued to harass his pursuers, inflicting significant casualties while remaining unscathed. The primary mission of Moremi's men was not, however, to inflict losses on the enemy so much as to ensnare them into a well designed trap. His force thus gradually retreated northward towards Khutiyabasadi, drawing the amaNdebele to where the main body of defenders were already well entrenched. As they approached the swamp area south Khutiyabasadi, Lotshe struggled to reunite his men, perhaps sensing that they were approaching a showdown. But, instead, Moremi's Batawana, now joined by Qhunkunyane's Wayeyi drew the amaNdebele still deeper into the swamps. Graduation daggers that were given to Tswana Fighting Regiments In this area of poor visibility, due to the thick tall reeds, the Batawana and Wayeyi were able to employ additional tricks to lure the invaders towards their ultimate doom. At one point a calf and its mother were tied to separate trees to make Lotshe's men think that they were finally catching up to their main prize, the elusive Batawana cattle. As they pressed forward the amaNdebele were further unnerved by additional hit and run attacks and sniping by small bands of Batawana marksmen. Certainly they could not have been comfortable in the unfamiliar Okavango environment. It was at Kuthiyabasadi that the defenders' trap was finally sprung. At the time, the place was an island dominated by high reeds and surrounded to the west by deep water. In the reeds, three well armed Batawana regiments, joined by local Wayeyi, waited patiently. There they had built a small wooden platform, upon which several men could be seen from across the channel, as well tunnels and entrenchments for concealment. The amaNdebele were drawn to the spot by the appearance of Batawana cavalry who crossed the channel to the island in their sight. In addition, cattle were placed on a small islet adjacent to Kuthiyabasadi, while a group of soldiers now made themselves visible by standing up on the wooden platform. Also at the location was a papyrus bridge that had been purposely weakened at crucial spots. Surveying the scene, Lotshe ordered his men to charge across the bridge over what he presumably thought was no more than a small stream. As planned, the bridge collapsed when full of amaNdebele, who were thus unexpectedly thrown into a deep water channel. Few if any would have known how to swim. Additional waves of amaNdebele found themselves pinned down by their charging compatriots along the river bank, which was too deep for them to easily ford. With the enemy thus in disarray, the signal was given for the main body of defenders to emerge from their tunnels and trenches. A barrage of bullets cut through Lotshe's lines from three sides, quickly turning the battle into a one-sided massacre. It is said that after the main firing had ceased, the Wayeyi used their mekoro to further attack the survivors trapped in the river, hitting them on the head with their oars. In this way, many more were drowned. By the time the fighting was over, the blood is reported to have turned the water along the course of the river black. While the total number of casualties at Khutiyabasadi cannot be precisely known, observers in Bulawayo at the time confirm that over 2,500 men had left on Lotshe's expedition and less than 500 returned. While the bulk of the amaNdebele losses are believed to have occurred in and around Khutiyabasadi itself, survivors of the battle were also killed while being mercilessly pursued by the Batawana cavalry. Moremi was clearly determined to send a strong message to Lobengula that his regiments were no match. Still others died of exhaustion and hunger while trying to make their way home across the dry plains south of Chobe; the somewhat more hospitable route through Gammangwato having been blocked by Khama. While the battle at Khutiyabasadi was a great victory for the Batawana and defeat for the amaNdebele, for the Wayeyi of the region the outcome is said to have been a mixed blessing. While they had shared in the victory over the hated Amandebele, one of its consequences was a tightening of Batawana authority in the area over them, as Moremi settled for a period at nearby Nokaneng. = First Matabele War = The First Matabele War was fought between 1893 and 1894 in modern-day Zimbabwe. The British South Africa Company had no more than 750 troops in the British South Africa Company's Police, with an undetermined number of possible colonial volunteers and an additional 700 Tswana (Bechuana) allies who marched on Bulawayo from the south commandeered by Khama III, the most influential of the Batswana chiefs, and a staunch ally of the British. The Salisbury and Fort Victoria columns marched into Bulawayo on 4 November 1893. The Imperial column from Bechuanaland was nowhere to be seen. They had set march on 18 October heading north for Bulawayo and had a minor skirmish with the Matabele near Mphoengs on 2 November. They finally reached Bulawayo on 15 November, a delay which probably saved the Chartered Company's then newly occupied territory being annexed to the imperial Bechuanaland Protectorate. = Bophuthatswana = Flag of Bophuthatswana The Bophuthatswana Territorial Authority was created in 1961, and in June 1972 Bophuthatswana was declared a self-governing state. On 6 December 1977 this 'homeland' was granted independence by the South African government. Bophuthatswana's capital city was Mmabatho and 99% of its population was Tswana speaking. In March 1994, Bophuthatswana was placed under the control of two administrators, Tjaart van der Walt and Job Mokgoro. The small, widespread pieces of land were reincorporated into South Africa on 27 April 1994. Bophuthatswana is part of the North West Province under Premier Prof Job Mokgoro. On 9 May 2018, Mahumapelo, who was Premier before Prof Mokgoro, announced that he would take leave of absence and appointed Finance MEC Wendy Nelson as acting premier. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed an inter- ministerial task team to investigate violent protests in the province's capital Mahikeng and other towns through the province over a long period of time. Supra Mahumapelo officially resigned on 23 May 2018. Dynasties and tribe =Botswana= The republic of Botswana (formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland) is named for the Tswana people. The country's eight major tribes/clans speak Tswana, which is also called Setswana. All have a traditional Paramount Chief, styled Kgosikgolo, who is entitled to a seat in the Ntlo ya Dikgosi (an advisory body to the country's Parliament). The Tswana dynasties are all related. A person who lives in Botswana is a Motswana and the plural is Batswana. The three main branches of the Tswana tribe formed during the 17th century. Three brothers, Kwena, Ngwaketse and Ngwato, broke away from their father, Chief Malope, to establish their own tribes in Molepolole, Kanye and Serowe, probably in response to drought and expanding populations in search of pasture and arable land. The principal Tswana tribes/clans are the: * Bafokeng * Bakgatla (Kgatla) * Bakhurutse * Bakwena * Balete * Bangwato * BaNgwaketse * Barolong * Bataung * Batlase * Batlhaping * Batl√¥kwa =South Africa= The largest number of ethnic Tswana people actually live in South Africa. They are one of the largest ethnic groups in the country, and the Tswana language is one of eleven official languages in South Africa. There were over 4 million Tswana speakers in the country in 2012, with North West Province having a majority of 2,200,000 Tswana speakers. From 1948 to 1994, South African Tswana people were defined by the Apartheid regime to be citizens of Bophuthatswana, one of ten bantustans set up for the purpose of defending the policy of denying black Africans citizenship in South Africa.

Setswana food and cuisine Bogobe is a porridge made from sorghum or millet which can be prepared differently to make various porridges. The most popular sorghum porridge is Ting. Bogobe jwa Logala/Sengana is a traditional Setswana dish prepared from sorghum porridge mixed/cooked with milk. Seswaa is Botswana's national dish and is often served at weddings, funerals, and other celebrations. Seswaa is a pounded or shredded meat and often served with Bogobe (Porridge). Madila is a sour cultured milk a primitive form of cheese curd prepared from cow and goat milk over a period of time until fully matured for consumption. Traditionally madila were prepared using Lekuka a leather sack or bag used in processing and storing madila. Madila is also traditionally used as relish, eaten with pap. It can also be used in popular Tswana breakfast meal, motogo, to give the soft porridge that sour and milky taste. Culture and attire Batswana wear a cotton fabric known in Setswana as Leteishi and Sotho as Shweshwe. This fabric is often used for wedding celebrations and other traditional celebrations. In Setswana tradition mothers wear mogagolwane, a checkered small blanket during traditional baby-showers, and married women during traditional weddings are identified by it, as well as during various initiation ceremonies. Even during funerals Batswana women don mogagolwane. Music Tswana music is mostly vocal and performed, sometimes without drums depending on the occasion; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane (a Botswana version of miniature piano), Segankure/Segaba (a Botswana version of the Chinese instrument Erhu), Moropa (Meropa -plural) (a Botswana version of the many varieties of drums),and phala (a Botswana version of a whistle used mostly during celebrations, which comes in a variety of forms). Botswana cultural musical instruments are not confined only to the strings or drums. the hands are used as musical instruments too, by either clapping them together or against phathisi (goat skin turned inside out wrapped around the calf area; it is only used by men) to create music and rhythm. For the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music as it offers a variety in string which the Segaba instrument does not have. Other notable modern Tswana music is Tswana Rap known as Motswako. Visual arts Tswana Baskets Batswana are noted for their skill at crafting baskets from Mokola Palm and local dyes. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. Potters made clay pots for storing water, traditional beer and also for cooking and hardly for commercial use. Craft makers made wooden crafts and they made traditional cooking utensils such as leso and lehetlho, traditional wooden chairs and drums among others. Tswana astronomy Milky Way Galaxy Astronomy is an old age tradition in Africa. As with all other cultures, various ethnic groups developed their own interpretations of the solar system. Using their natural instrument the eye, Batswana have observed, commented on and named celestial objects of interest to them. There are more telling and specific names that relate to unique stellar patterns and their seasonal appearance e.g. Selemela, Naka, Thutlwa, and Dikolojwane. According to Tswana culture, the stars of Orion's sword were \\"dintsa le Dikolobe\\", three dogs chasing three pigs of Orion's belt. The Milky Way was viewed by the Tswana as Molalatladi, the place where lightning rests. It was further believed that this place of rest also kept the sky from collapsing and showed the movement of time. Some even claimed that it turned the sun to the east, in a way to explaining the rising of the sun. It was also believed that it was a supernatural footpath across the sky along which ancestors' spirits walked. The moon (Ngwedi) is said to represent a woman; it brings forth light but not as scorching as the Sun (Letsatsi) and its light is associated with happiness. Venus is called Mphatlalatsana (the brilliant and blinding one) by Batswana & Kopadilalelo (seeker of evening meals). The southern African calendar was made up of 354 days, (12 x 29.5 day lunar month). This was 11 days shorter than the solar year, an issue which could not be ignored. The solution was to add an additional month, when necessary, to \\"catch up\\". Some years were 12 months long, others 13. After the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of the Gregorian calendar, it was noted that the Batswana people had started forgetting the name of the 13th month. In contrast to Europe, where the new year is in the middle of winter, in southern Africa it logically started in September or October at the start of the new growing season. Raditladi Basin, a large peak ring impact crater on Mercury with a diameter of 263 km is named after Leetile Disang Raditladi. a Motswana playwright and poet.

Life He came from an established Norfolk family, and was born at Melton Constable Hall. His first experiences of war were at the age of 18 when he joined the Islands Voyage expedition in 1597 under the Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh to the Azores. In 1598 he joined Maurice of Nassau and Henry of Orange in the Netherlands, where he served with distinction, and afterwards fought under Frederick V, Elector Palatine and Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War. He was evidently thought highly of by the States-General, for when he was absent, serving under Christian IV of Denmark, his position in the Dutch army was kept open for him. In 1622 Astley joined the household of Elizabeth, daughter of James I of England and her husband Frederick, King of Bohemia serving as tutor to Frederick's son Prince Rupert. Returning to England with a well-deserved reputation, he was in the employment of Charles I in various military capacities. As \\"Sergeant-Major-General\\" of the infantry, he went north in 1639 to organize the defence against the expected Scottish invasion. Here his duties were as much diplomatic as military, as the discontent which ended in the Civil War was now coming to a head. In the ill-starred Bishops' Wars, Astley did good service to the cause of the king, and he was involved in the so-called \\"Army Plot\\". At the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642 he at once joined Charles, and was made Major-General of the Foot (infantry)‚Äîthe cavalry was under the command of his former student Prince Rupert. His characteristic battle-prayer at the Battle of Edgehill has become famous: \\"O Lord, Thou knowest how busy I must be this day. If I forget Thee, do not thou forget me\\" which he followed promptly with the order \\"March on, boys!\\" Both sides' troops were poorly trained and both sides claimed the battle to be a victory, but the outcome was inconclusive and it would take a further three years of civil war before the Royalists lost to the Parliamentarians. Astley was loyal supporter of the Crown throughout the First Civil War, while his own region of East Anglia was strongly Parliamentarian. His opposite number in the Parliamentarians was Philip Skippon, another Norfolkman. At Gloucester Astley commanded a division, and at the First Battle of Newbury he led the infantry of the royal army. With Ralph Hopton, in 1644, he served at Arundel and Cheriton. He was not present at Cheriton, although his son, Bernard, probably was, as his regiment of foot was certainly there. At the second Battle of Newbury he made a gallant and memorable defence of Shaw House. He was made a baron by King Charles, and at the Battle of Naseby he once more commanded the main body of the infantry. He afterwards served in the west, and with 3,000 men fought stubbornly but vainly at the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold (March 1646), the last pitched battle of the First Civil War. He surrendered to the Parliamentarians with the words \\"Well, boys, you have done your work, now you may go and play‚Äîif you don't fall out among yourselves\\". His scrupulous sense of honour forbade him to take any part in the Second Civil War, as he had given his parole at Stow-on-the-Wold; but he had to undergo his share of the discomforts that were the lot of the vanquished royalists. He was imprisoned initially but able to retire to Maidstone. He died in February 1652. The barony became extinct in 1688. Family He married a Dutch woman, Agnes Impel, who bore him two sons and a daughter. Notes References *Anglian Annals 87:Jacob Astley, Peter Sargent Eastern Daily Press Saturday 31 December 2005.

She was launched on 3 May 1977 as the seventh ship to carry the name. She was originally designated as an anti-submarine warfare carrier, but was used as an aircraft carrier during the Falklands War, when she was deployed with . She took over as flagship of the British fleet when Hermes was sold to India. Invincible was also deployed in the Yugoslav Wars and the Second Gulf War (Iraq War). In 2005, she was decommissioned, and was eventually sold for scrap to the Turkish company Leyal Ship Recycling in February 2011. Design As built, Invincible was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of at the waterline and at flight deck level, and a draught of at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by four Rolls-Royce Olympus TBM3 gas turbines, with a maximum total continuous power of . These drove two propeller shafts via reversible gearboxes, giving a maximum speed of . The ship had a range of at . Invincibles flight deck was long and wide. It was connected to the ship's hangar by two lifts, with dimensions of √ó and rated to carry aircraft with a weight of . The hangar itself was long, with width varying between and a height of . An upward-curved Ski-jump ramp at an angle of 6.5 degrees was fitted at the forward end of the ship's flight deck, this allowed the carrier's Sea Harriers to take off with a higher disposal payload, while shortening the take-off run, leaving more space for helicopter operations. The ship had a design air wing of 10 Westland Sea King anti-submarine helicopters and 8 British Aerospace Sea Harrier STOVL jet fighters. As built, defensive armament consisted of a twin Sea Dart Surface to air missile launcher in the ship's bows. 22 Sea Dart missiles were carried. A Type 1022 long-range air- search radar was mounted above the ship's bridge, with Type 909 fire control directors for the Sea Dart system mounted at the fore and aft end of the ship's superstructure. A Type 992 air-surface search radar was mounted on the ship's mainmast, while a Type 1006 navigation radar was also fitted. Type 184 medium range sonar was also fitted. =Modifications= In September 1982, after returning from the Falklands War, Invincible had her close-in armament supplemented by two Phalanx CIWS and two Oerlikon 20 mm anti-aircraft autocannons. She underwent a major refit in 1986‚Äì1989, with several changes to increase the ship's efficiency in operating aircraft. The angle of the ship's ski-jump was increased to 12 degrees, with her hangar modified to allow more aircraft (nine Sea Harriers and twelve Sea Kings) to be accommodated below. The ship's overall length increased to . Additional command facilities were fitted and accommodation for another 120 people (aircrew and command staff) was added. The ship's magazines were enlarged, allowing Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles for the carrier's Sea Harriers to be carried, while also increasing the number of torpedoes carried for the ship's helicopters. Three Thales 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWS replaced the Phalanxes. Type 996 air-sea search radar replaced the Type 992 radar, with Type 2016 sonar replaced the Type 184. In 2000, Invincible was subject to further modifications to allow her to operate Harrier GR.7s in the ground-attack role. The Sea Dart launcher was removed, while the ship's flight deck was enlarged.  History  Invincible was ordered from Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering on 17 April 1973, and was laid down at Vickers' Barrow-in-Furness on 17 April 1973. The ship's construction was delayed by design changes and industrial action, and Invincible was not launched until 3 May 1977. She was accepted into Royal Navy service on 19 March 1980 and after trials, formally commissioned on 11 July 1980. More trials and work-up followed for the ship and her air wing followed before she was declared operational on 19 June 1981, joining the fleet's other carrier Hermes in service. Invincibles initial air wing consisted of 801 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with five Sea Harriers and 820 Naval Air Squadron, equipped with Sea King anti-submarine helicopters. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1981, Invicible took part in the NATO naval exercises \\"Ocean Venture\\" and \\"Ocean Safari\\". =Proposed sale and Falklands War= Invincible in the South Atlantic, during the Falklands War Invincible returns to the Solent after the Falklands War On 25 February 1982, after several months of negotiations, the Australian government announced that it had agreed to buy Invincible for ¬£175 million (285 million A$) as a replacement, under the name HMAS Australia, for the Royal Australian Navy's . Australia planned to make minimal changes to the carrier, adding more fuel and replacing some of the ship's computers. Initially at least, it was planned to operate helicopters only. The sale was confirmed by the Ministry of Defence. On 2 April 1982, however, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. Three days later, a naval task force headed by Invincible and Hermes left HMNB Portsmouth bound for the South Atlantic. On 20 April, the UK government formally ordered its defence forces to bring the islands back under British control. Along with eight Sea Harriers, the Invincibles airgroup included twelve Sea King helicopters that were slightly larger than the ship had originally been designed to accommodate. Small machine guns were added around the flight deck and island for close-in defence. On 23 April, while en route from Ascension Island to the Falklands, Invincible mistakenly locked her Sea Dart missile system on a VARIG Brazilian Airlines DC-10 rather than on the Argentine Air Force Boeing 707 that had been monitoring the fleet's movements.Lawrence Freedman, Official History of the Falklands Campaign, Volume 2 (), p. 223‚Äì224. The previous day, Task Group Commander Rear Admiral Sandy Woodward had sought permission from Commander-in- Chief Admiral Sir John Fieldhouse to shoot down the 707Admiral Sandy Woodward, One Hundred Days (), p. 143‚Äì145. The aircraft had been nicknamed \\"the Burglar\\". Woodward believed he had been given permission to shoot it down if came within a certain distance of the task force and could be positively identified, although this course of action had not been confirmed. as he believed its activity indicated a raid would be launched from the Argentine aircraft carrier ARA Veinticinco de Mayo. As the 707 would be no direct threat to the fleet, Woodward ordered Weapons Tight and the continued tracking of the aircraft's course while a Sea Harrier was dispatched to investigate. The Harrier pilot reported that \\"it was a Brazilian airliner, with all the normal navigation and running lights on.\\" Details of the Harrier interception appeared in the Brazilian press along with the claim that the DC-10's passengers were \\"alleged to have been frightened\\" and Woodward's comment that \\"[i]nconvenience to passengers' underwear regretted unless any of them were Argentinian\\". On 30 May, two Super √âtendards, one carrying Argentina's last remaining air-launched Exocet, escorted by four A-4C Skyhawks each with two 500lb bombs, took off to attack Invincible. Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands. However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position. This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the main body of ships. Two of the attacking Skyhawks were shot down by Sea Darts fired by , with HMS Avenger claiming to have shot down the missile with her 4.5\\" gun (although this claim is disputed). No damage was caused to any British vessels. During the war Argentina claimed to have damaged the ship and continues to do so to this day, although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered. On 1 June, the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, advised the British government that the sale of Invincible to Australia could be cancelled if desired. In July 1983, a year after the end of the Falklands conflict,The UK formally declared an end to hostilities on 20 June 1982 (). the Ministry of Defence announced that it had withdrawn its offer to sell Invincible so it could maintain a three-carrier force. =1983‚Äì2005= In December 1983, Invincible was refused the use of dry dock facilities in Sydney when the Royal Navy declined to divulge to the Australian authorities whether or not the ship was carrying nuclear weapons. Between 1993 and 1995, Invincible was deployed in the Adriatic for Operation \\"Deny Flight\\" and then Operation \\"Deliberate Force\\" during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1997, flying the flag of Rear-Admiral Alan West, Commander UK Task Group, Invincible led a deployment that included 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines. During the following two years, Invincible contributed to Operation \\"Bolton\\" (part of Operation \\"Southern Watch\\") in southern Iraq before she was redeployed to the Balkans to support the NATO action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo. There, while her helicopters aided refugees, her Harriers were involved in military strikes. In 2003, Invincible featured in a skit of the BBC show Top Gear involving The Stig racing a white Jaguar XJS known as \\"The Top Gear Jag\\" on the deck in an attempt to reach 100 mph and stop before the end of the runway. The attempt failed, resulting in The Stig and the Jaguar ending up in the sea. Jeremy Clarkson ended the show holding one of The Stig's gloves, claiming that it was all the salvage crew found of The Stig. The old Stig was replaced by the first White Stig in the next episode. The car was driven up to the ramp on the flight deck then on the following day the car was propelled off the ramp using a high pressure air rig. The vehicle was never recovered. A Sea Harrier FA2 on the deck of Invincible =2005‚Äì2011= On 6 June 2005, the British Ministry of Defence announced that Invincible would be inactive until 2010 but available for reactivation at eighteen months' notice. She was decommissioned on 3 August 2005, twenty months after an extensive refit that had been intended to give her ten more years of service. succeeded her as the service's flagship. The Royal Navy maintained that Invincible could have been deployed had the need arisen and that Navy policy assumed she was still an active aircraft carrier. According to Jane's, however, Invincible had been stripped of some parts for her sister ships, so operational readiness would require not only eighteen months but also the replacement or removal of systems from those other ships. In March 2010, Invincible was tied up and minimally maintained with other decommissioned ships up-river of HMNB Portsmouth. On 10 September 2010, she was struck off the Naval Reserve ListNorth West Evening Mail Barrow- built Invincible thrown out of the Navy and, in December, offered for sale by the Disposal Services Authority (DSA) with tenders due by 5 January 2011. The DSA tender documents confirmed that the ship's engines had been removed and that its generators and pumps were \\"generally unserviceable or not working\\". On 8 January 2011, the British press relayed an earlier report in the South China Morning Post that a ¬£5-million bid had been made for the ship by the UK- based Chinese businessman Lam Kin-bong with plans to moor her at Zhuhai or Liverpool as a floating international school. In light, however, of China's re-arming of the Varyagbought under a similar pretextand the EU arms embargo on China, doubts were raised as to whether such a sale would go ahead. A month later, in February 2011, BBC News reported that the Ministry of Defence had announced the sale of Invincible to Leyal Ship Recycling in Turkey. She was towed out of Portsmouth on 24 March and arrived at Leyal's Aliaƒüa yard on 12 April 2011 for scrapping. By June 2011, work was underway to break up the ship.  Weapons and aircraft  Invincibles Sea Dart. Invincible initially lacked any close-in weapon systems. As one of the lessons from the Falklands War Invincible had two 20 mm Raytheon Phalanx close-in weapon systems fitted but these were later replaced by three Thales 30 mm Goalkeeper CIWS; there are also two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. Countermeasures were provided by a Thales jamming system and ECM system, Seagnat launchers provide for chaff or flare decoys. Initially the carriers were armed with a Sea Dart SAM missile system, but this was removed to enlarge the flight deck and to allow magazine storage and deck space for Royal Air Force Harrier GR7s. After the various refits, the carrier's air group grew from the original planned 5 Sea Harriers and 9 Sea Kings to nine Sea Harrier or Harrier GR7/9s and twelve helicopters (usually all Sea Kings, either anti-submarine warfare (ASW) or Airborne Early Warning (AEW) variants). Alternative airgroups were occasionally tested with 16 Harriers and 3 helicopters being embarked. The carrier was equipped with flagship facilities and could provide an operational headquarters for Royal Navy task forces. The runway was long and included the ship's characteristic ski jump (initially at an angle of 7¬∞, but later increased to 12¬∞).

It was inspired by actual dreams that Kurosawa claimed to have had repeatedly. It was his first film in 45 years in which he was the sole author of the screenplay. It was made five years after Ran, with assistance from George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and funded by Warner Bros. The film was screened out of competition at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, and to this day has received positive reviews. The main themes the movie addresses are: childhood, spirituality, art, death, universal disasters and man's mistakes regarding the world; all the segments of the film show a literal and a metaphorical side. Summary The film does not have a single narrative, but is rather episodic in nature, following the adventures of a \\"surrogate Kurosawa\\" (often recognizable by his wearing Kurosawa's trademark hat) through eight different segments, or \\"dreams\\", each one titled. =Sunshine Through The Rain= There is an old legend in Japan that states that when the sun is shining through the rain, the kitsune (foxes) have their weddings (this is a common theme globally ‚Äì see sunshower). In this first dream, a boy defies the wish of his mother to remain at home during a day with such weather. From behind a large tree in the nearby forest, he witnesses the slow wedding procession of the kitsune. Unfortunately, he is spotted by the foxes and runs home. The same woman meets him at the front door, barring the way, and says that an angry fox had come by the house, leaving behind a tant≈ç knife. The mother gives the knife to the boy and tells him that he must go and beg forgiveness from the foxes, although they are known to be unforgiving, refusing to let him in unless he does so. She warns that if he does not secure their forgiveness, he must take his own life. Taking the knife, the boy sets off into the mountains, towards the place under the rainbow in search for the kitsune's home. Kurosawa built a near exact replica of his childhood home for this segment, and the nameplate on the gate even reads \\"Kurosawa\\". Kurosawa even showed the actress playing the mother a photo of his own mother, and gave her tips on how to act as her. =The Peach Orchard= Hina Matsuri, the Doll Festival, traditionally takes place in spring when the peach blossoms are in full bloom. The dolls that go on display at this time, they say, are representative of the peach trees and their pink blossoms. One boy's family, however, has chopped down their peach orchard, so the boy feels a sense of loss during this year's festival. After being scolded by his older sister the boy spots a small girl dressed in pink running out the front door. He follows her to the now-treeless orchard, where the dolls from his sister's collection have come to life and are standing before him on the slopes of the orchard. The living dolls, revealing themselves to be the spirits of the peach trees, berate the boy about chopping down the precious trees. But after realizing how much he loved the blossoms, they agree to give him one last glance at the peach trees by way of a slow and beautiful dance to Etenraku. The boy sees the mysterious girl walking among the blooming trees and runs after her, but she and the trees vanish and he walks sadly through the thicket of stumps where the trees had been, until he sees a single young peach tree, in full bloom, sprouting in her place. The mysterious girl may be a reference to an older sister of Kurosawa's who died of illness when he was in the fourth grade. =The Blizzard= A group of four mountaineers, including an adolescent Kurosawa, struggle up a mountain path during a horrendous blizzard. It has been snowing for three days and the men are dispirited and ready to give up. One by one they stop walking, giving in to the snow and sure death. The leader endeavors to push on, but he too, stops in the snow. A strange woman (the Yuki-onna of Japanese myth) appears out of nowhere and attempts to lure the last conscious man to his death - give in to the snow and the storm, she urges him on, into reverie, into sleep, into certain death. But finding some heart, deep within, he shakes off his stupor and her entreaties, to discover that the storm has abated, and that their camp is only a few feet away. The setting for this sequence was most likely inspired from Kurosawa's personal life, since he confessed to being \\"a devotee of mountain climbing\\". =The Tunnel= A discharged Japanese company commander is walking down a deserted road at dusk, on his way back home from fighting in the Second World War. He comes to a large concrete pedestrian tunnel that seems to go on forever into the darkness. Suddenly, an angry, almost demonic-looking anti-tank dog (strapped with explosives) runs out of the tunnel, barking and snarling. The dog herds him into the tunnel. The commander walks hesitatingly into its darkness. He comes out the other side, only to witness the horrific y≈´rei (ghost) of one of his soldiers, Private Noguchi (Yoshitaka Zushi, who was also in Kurosawa's Dodes'ka-den), who had died severely wounded in the commander's arms. Noguchi's face is light blue with blackened eyes, signifying that he is dead. The soldier seems not to believe that he is gone. Noguchi has appeared because his parents' house is visible in a nearby mountainside, a light in the darkness left on for his return. He is heartbroken, knowing he cannot see them again, even while he remains respectful to the commander who led him to his death. Following the commander's wish that he accept his fate Noguchi returns to the tunnel. Just when the commander thinks he's seen the worst, his entire third platoon, led by a young lieutenant brandishing an officer's sword, marches out of the tunnel. They come to a halt and present arms, saluting the commander. Their faces too are colored blue, for they were all annihilated in a single action. The commander searches for words to tell them that they are dead, and says that he himself is to blame for sending them into a futile battle. They stand mute in reply. The commander orders them to turn about face, and salutes them in a farewell as they march back into the tunnel. Collapsing in grief, the commander is quickly brought back to his feet by the reappearance of the hellish dog. =Crows= A vignette featuring director Martin Scorsese as Vincent van Gogh. An art student finds himself inside the world of Van Gogh's artwork, where he meets the artist in a field and converses with him. Van Gogh relates that his left ear gave him problems during a self portrait, so he cut it off. The student loses track of the artist, and travels through other works trying to find him, concluding with Van Gogh's Wheat Field with Crows. This Segment features Prelude No. 15 in D-flat major (\\"Raindrop\\") by Chopin. The visual effects for this particular segment were provided by George Lucas and his special effects group Industrial Light & Magic. It is also the only segment where the characters do not speak Japanese but English and French. =Mount Fuji in Red= A large nuclear power plant near Mount Fuji has begun to melt down; its six reactors explode one by one. The breaches fill the sky with hellish red fumes and send millions of Japanese citizens fleeing in terror towards the ocean. After an unspecified amount of time, two men, a woman, and her two small children are seen alone, left behind on land in broad daylight. Behind them is the sea. The older man (Hisashi Igawa, who appeared in a number of Kurosawa's later movies), who is dressed in a business suit, explains to the younger man that the rest have drowned themselves in the ocean. He then says that the several colours of the clouds billowing across the now rubbish-strewn, post-apocalyptic landscape signify different radioactive isotopes; according to him, red signifies plutonium-239, a tenth of a microgram of which is enough to cause cancer. He elaborates on how other released isotopes cause leukemia (strontium-90) and birth defects (cesium-137) before wondering at the foolish futility of colour- coding radioactive gases of such lethality. The woman, hearing these descriptions, recoils in horror before angrily cursing those responsible and the pre-disaster assurances of safety they had given. The suited man then displays contrition, suggesting that he is in part responsible for the disaster. The other man, dressed casually, watches the multicoloured radioactive clouds advance upon them. When he turns back towards the others at the shore, he sees the woman weeping: the suit-clad man has leaped to his death. A cloud of red dust reaches them, causing the mother to shrink back in terror. The remaining man attempts to shield the mother and her children by using his jacket to feebly fan away the now-incessant radioactive billows. Mount Fuji in Red was sub-directed by Ishiro Honda, the Director of Godzilla (1954), in which we meet (essentially) this same woman and her two children in similar dire circumstances.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100998/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ql_1 =The Weeping Demon= A man finds himself wandering around a misty, bleak mountainous terrain. He meets a strange oni-like man, who is actually a mutated human with one horn. The \\"demon\\" explains that there had been a nuclear holocaust which resulted in the loss of nature and animals, towering dandelions taller than a man, and humans sprouting horns, which cause them so much agony that you can hear them howling during the night, but, according to the demon, they can't die, which makes their agony even worse. Many of the \\"demons\\" were former millionaires and government officials, who are now (in Buddhist style) suffering through a hell befitting for their sins. At the last scene, the \\"demon\\" warns the man to go away, asks if he also wants to become demon. The horrified man then runs away from the scene with the demon in pursuit. =Village of the Watermills= Watermills in the Daio Wasabi farm A young man finds himself entering a peaceful, stream-laden village. The traveler meets an old, wise man (he tells the young man that he is 103 years old) who is fixing a broken watermill wheel. The elder explains that the people of his village decided long ago to forsake the polluting influence of modern technology and return to a happier, cleaner era of society. They have chosen spiritual health over convenience, and the traveler is surprised but intrigued by this notion. At the end of the sequence (and the film), a funeral procession for an old woman takes place in the village, which instead of mourning, the people celebrate joyfully as the proper end to a good life. This segment was filmed at the Daio Wasabi farm in the Nagano Prefecture. The film ends with a haunting, melancholic excerpt from \\"In the Village\\", part of the Caucasian Sketches, Suite No. 1 by the Russian composer Mikhail Ippolitov- Ivanov. One aspect of the village in this sequence is a large stone which local children place flowers over; the old man reveals this to be the grave of a traveler who died long ago, and it has become a tradition to lay flowers over it as you pass. Kurosawa was most likely inspired by a similar stone from his father's home village: > Near the main thoroughfare of the village stood a huge rock, and there were > always cut flowers on top of it. All the children who passed by it picked > wild flowers and laid them atop the stone. When I wondered why they did this > and asked, the children said they didn't know. I found out later by asking > one of the old men in the village. In the Battle of Boshin, a hundred years > ago, someone died at that spot. Feeling sorry for him, the villagers buried > him, put the stone over the grave and laid flowers on it. The flowers became > a custom of the village, which the children maintained without ever knowing > why. Before the end credits, the young man himself pauses to lay a flower over the stone.

The magical and mysterious are mixed with the practical, funny and polemical.\\"Kurosawa's Magical Tales of Art, Time and Death , May 20, 2003, Vincent Canby, New York Times. The Encyclopedia of International Film states: \\"At 80, Kurosawa [...] is impatient with artifice; He has long been a master of complex narrative. Now he wants to tell what he does. There are no wild juxtapositions of the creatures of his sleeping world with the images of his waking world. They are, after all, products of the same sensibility. The rhythms of his editing and his staging are serene - hypnotically so. To be able to do so, we need to know what is going on. And this is one of the most lucid dreamworks ever placed on film.\\"Richard Schickel: Night Tales, Magically Told, September 9, 1990 in Time Magazine, online resource, retrieved on September 24, 2007, translated by Wikipedia. Donald Richie and Joan Mellen, in an article said: \\"Beyond himself, he is beautiful because the beauty is in the attitude of the director. This is evident not only in the didactic approach, but also in the whole slowness, in the quantity of respect and in the enormous, insolent security of the work. That a director in 1990 could be so strong, so serious, so moral and so hopeful, is already beautiful.\\"Donald Richie, Joan Mellen: The Films of Akira Kurosawa.

Biography The Count of Egmont was at the head of one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the Low Countries. Paternally, a branch of the Egmonts ruled the sovereign duchy of Guelders until 1538. Lamoral was born in La Hamaide near Ellezelles. His father was John IV of Egmont, knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. His mother belonged to a cadet branch of the House of Luxembourg, and through her he inherited the title prince de Gavere.The complicated series of inheritances through which Gavre/Gavere in Flanders and its dependencies passed through the heiress Beatrix de Gavre to Guy IX de Laval and was sold in 1515 to Jacques de Luxembourg, is sketched in Arthur Bertrand de Broussillon, Paul de Farcy, Eug√®ne Vall√©e, La maison de Laval, 1020-1605 (1895-1903), vol. 4 Les Montfort-Laval et leur cadets, 1501-1605, s.v. \\"Guy XVI\\" de Laval, pp. 5-7. During his youth, he received a military education in Spain. In 1542, he inherited the estates of his elder brother Charles in Holland. His family's stature increased further in 1544 when, at Spires, in the presence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and of the Archduke Ferdinand I, he married the Countess Palatine Sabine of Simmern, whose brother became the Elector Palatine Frederick III. By appointment, he was Captain General of the Lowlands under Charles V, knight of the Golden Fleece from 1546, and Imperial Chamberlain. In the service of the Spanish army, he defeated the French in the battles of Saint-Quentin (1557) and Gravelines (1558). Egmont was appointed stadtholder of Flanders and Artois in 1559, aged only 37. Pieter Christiaanszoon Bor: Oorsprongh, begin en vervolgh der Nederlandsche oorlogen, 1621 As a leading Netherlandic nobleman, Egmont was a member of King Philip II of Spain's official Council of State for Flanders and Artois. Together with William, Prince of Orange and the Count of Horn, he protested against the introduction of the inquisition in Flanders by the cardinal Antoine Perrenot Granvelle, bishop of Arras. Egmont even threatened to resign, but after Granvelle left, there was a reconciliation with the king. In 1565, running short of funds as he had continued the representation of the Low Countries entirely from his own pocket, Egmont went to Madrid to beseech Philip II, the king of Spain, for a change of policy in the Netherlands, but met with little more than courtesy. Soon thereafter, the 'Beeldenstorm' started, the massive iconoclasm of Catholic churches in the Netherlands, and resistance against the Spanish rule in the Netherlands increased. As a devout Catholic, Egmont deplored the iconoclasm, and remained faithful to the Spanish king. After Philip II sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands, William of Orange decided to flee Brussels. Having always declined to do anything that smacked of l√®se majest√©, Egmont refused to heed Orange's warning; thus he and Horn decided to stay in the city. Upon arrival, Alba almost immediately had the counts of Egmont and Horn arrested on charges of heresy, and imprisoned them in a castle in Ghent, prompting Egmont's wife and their eleven surviving children (from the thirteen they had together) to seek refuge in a convent. Pleas for amnesty came to the Spanish king from throughout Europe, including from many reigning sovereigns, the Order of the Golden Fleece (both being knights of the Order, and thereby theoretically immune from trial by any but their peers of the Order), and the king's kinsman the Emperor Maximilian II, all to no avail. Execution and destruction of Castle Egmond Egmont and Hoorne, from Pieter Christiaanszoon Bor: Oorsprongh, begin en vervolgh der Nederlandsche oorlogen, 1621 On 4 June Egmont and Horn were condemned to death, and lodged that night in the maison du roi. On 5 June 1568 both men were beheaded in the Grand Place in Brussels, Egmont's uncomplaining dignity on the occasion being widely noted. Their deaths led to public protests throughout the Netherlands, and contributed to the resistance against the Spaniards. The Count of Egmont lies buried in a crypt in Zottegem, a Belgian city in which Egmont is remembered by his two statues, his museum and his castle. His castle in Egmond aan den Hoef was destroyed in 1573 and a statue in his memory is erected on the site of the ruins. A statue erected on the Petit Sablon / Kleine Zavel Square in Brussels commemorates the Counts of Egmont and Horn, in historical overview usually mentioned together as \\"Egmond en Hoorne\\" and hailed as the first leaders of the Dutch revolt, as the predecessors of William of Orange, who grew to importance and obtained the leadership after their execution, and who was assassinated in 1584 in Delft, having succeeded in liberating parts of The Netherlands in the early years of the Eighty Years' War (1568‚Äì1648). Egmont's offices and vast estates were forfeited upon his execution, escheating to the Prince-Bishop of Li√®ge. By inheritance he had been count of Egmont (or Egmond), prince de Gavre and van Steenhuysen, baron de Fiennes, Gaesbeke and La Hamaide, seigneur de Purmerent, Hoogwoude, Aertswoude, Beyerland, Sottenghien, Dondes, Auxy and Baer. Some of these lands were eventually returned to his heirs by the Bishop, principally in 1600. Despite the taint of treason and the family's impoverishment, his niece Louise of Lorraine-Merc≈ìur, was chosen to become the Queen consort of Henry III of France in 1575. Literary treatments The Count of Egmont is the main character in a play by Goethe, Egmont. In 1810 Ludwig van Beethoven composed the Egmont Overture an overture and incidental music for a revival of the play.

First described in Murray Leinster's 1945 novella \\"First Contact\\",\\"Hic Rhodus, His Salta\\" by Robert Silverberg, Asimov's Science Fiction, January 2009, page 6. the translator's purpose is to offer an instant translation of any language. As a convention, it is used to remove the problem of translating between alien languages, unless that problem is essential to the plot. To translate a new language in every episode when a new species or culture is encountered would consume time (especially when most of these shows have a half-hour or one-hour format) normally allotted for plot development and would potentially, across many episodes, become repetitive to the point of annoyance. Occasionally, alien races are portrayed as being able to extrapolate the rules of English from little speech and then immediately be fluent in it, making the translator unnecessary. While a universal translator seems unlikely, due to the apparent need for telepathy, scientists continue to work towards similar real-world technologies involving small numbers of known languages. General As a rule, a universal translator is instantaneous, but if that language has never been recorded, there is sometimes a time delay until the translator can properly work out a translation, as is true of Star Trek. The operation of these translators is often explained as using some form of telepathy by reading the brain patterns of the speaker(s) to determine what they are saying; some writers seek greater plausibility by instead having computer translation that requires collecting a database of the new language, often by listening to radio transmissions. The existence of a universal translator tends to raise questions from a logical perspective, such as: * The continued functioning of the translator even when no device is evident; * Multiple speakers hear speech in one and only one language (so for example, for a Spanish speaker and a German speaker listening to an Italian speaker the Spanish speaker would only hear Spanish and neither the original Italian nor the translated German, while the German speaker would not hear any Spanish nor Italian but only German); * Characters' mouths move in sync with the translated words and not the original language; * The ability for the translator to function in real-time even for languages with different word order (such as a phrase the horse standing in front of the barn would end up in Japanese as Á¥çÂ±ã„ÅÆÂâç„Å´Á´ã„Å£„Å¶„ÅÑ„ÇãÈ¶¨, lit. barn-in-front-at-standing-horse, however there is no delay for the Japanese listener even when the English speaker has yet to mention the barn). Nonetheless, it removes the need for cumbersome and potentially extensive subtitles, and it eliminates the rather unlikely supposition that every other race in the galaxy has gone to the trouble of learning English.  Fictional depictions  =Doctor Who= Using a telepathic field, the TARDIS automatically translates most comprehensible languages (written and spoken) into a language understood by its pilot and each of the crew members. The field also translates what they say into a language appropriate for that time and location (e.g., speaking the appropriate dialect of Latin when in ancient Rome). This system has frequently been featured as a main part of the show. The TARDIS, and by extension a number of its major systems, including the translator, are telepathically linked to its pilot, the Doctor. None of these systems appear able to function reliably when the Doctor is incapacitated. In \\"The Fires of Pompeii\\", when companion Donna Noble attempts to speak the local language directly, her words are humorously rendered into what sounds to a local like Welsh. One flaw of this translation process is that if the language that a word is being translated into does not have a concept for it, e.g, the Romans don't have a word or a general understanding of \\"volcano\\" as Mt. Vesuvius has not erupted yet. =Farscape= On the TV show Farscape, John Crichton is injected with bacteria called translator microbes which function as a sort of universal translator. The microbes colonize the host's brainstem and translate anything spoken to the host, passing along the translated information to the host's brain. This does not enable the injected person to speak other languages; they continue to speak their own language and are only understood by others as long as the listeners possess the microbes. The microbes sometimes fail to properly translate slang, translating it literally. Also, the translator microbes cannot translate the natural language of the alien Pilots or Diagnosans because every word in their language can contain thousands of meanings, far too many for the microbes to translate; thus Pilots must learn to speak in \\"simple sentences\\", while Diagnosans require interpreters. The implanted can learn to speak new languages if they want or to make communicating with non- injected individuals possible. The crew of Moya learned English from Crichton, thereby being able to communicate with the non-implanted populace when the crew visited Earth. Some species, such as the Kalish, cannot use translator microbes because their body rejects them, so they must learn a new language through their own efforts. =The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy= In the universe of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, universal translation is made possible by a small fish called a \\"babel fish\\". The fish is inserted into the auditory canal where it feeds off the mental frequencies of those speaking to its host. In turn it excretes a translation into the brain of its host. The book remarks that, by allowing everyone to understand each other, the babel fish has caused more wars than anything else in the universe. The book also explains that the babel fish could not possibly have developed naturally and therefore proves the existence of God as its creator, which in turn proves the non-existence of God. Since God needs faith to exist, and this proof dispels the need for faith, this therefore causes God to vanish \\"in a puff of logic\\". =Men in Black= The Men in Black franchise possess a universal translator, which, as Agent K explains in the first film, Men in Black, they are not allowed to have because \\"human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in some of the better galaxies.\\" remarking ‚ÄúThat kinda makes you proud, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù =Neuromancer= In William Gibson's novel Neuromancer, along with the other novels in his Sprawl trilogy, Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive, devices known as \\"microsofts\\" are small chips plugged into \\"wetware\\" sockets installed behind the user's ear, giving them certain knowledge and/or skills as long as they are plugged in, such as the ability to speak another language. (The name is a combination of the words \\"micro\\" and \\"soft\\", and is not named after the software firm Microsoft.) =Star Control= In the Star Control computer game series, almost all races are implied to have universal translators; however, discrepancies between the ways aliens choose to translate themselves sometimes crop up and complicate communications. The VUX, for instance, are cited as having uniquely advanced skills in linguistics and can translate human language long before humans are capable of doing the same to the VUX. This created a problem during the first contact between Vux and humans, in a starship commanded by Captain Rand. According to Star Control: Great Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict, Captain Rand is referred to as saying \\"That is one ugly sucker\\" when the image of a VUX first came onto his viewscreen. However, in Star Control II, Captain Rand is referred to as saying \\"That is the ugliest freak-face I've ever seen\\" to his first officer, along with joking that the VUX name stands for Very Ugly Xenoform. It is debatable which source is canon. Whichever the remark, it is implied that the VUX's advanced Universal Translator technologies conveyed the exact meaning of Captain Rand's words. The effete VUX used the insult as an excuse for hostility toward humans. Also, a new race called the Orz was introduced in Star Control II. They presumably come from another dimension, and at first contact, the ship's computer says that there are many vocal anomalies in their language resulting from their referring to concepts or phenomena for which there are no equivalents in human language. The result is dialogue that is a patchwork of ordinary words and phrases marked with *asterisk pairs* indicating that they are loose translations of unique Orz concepts into human language, a full translation of which would probably require paragraph-long definitions. (For instance, the Orz refer to the human dimension as *heavy space* and their own as *Pretty Space*, to various categories of races as *happy campers* or *silly cows*, and so on.) In the other direction, the Supox are a race portrayed as attempting to mimic as many aspects of other races' language and culture as possible when speaking to them, to the point of referring to their own planet as ‚ÄúEarth,‚Äù also leading to confusion. In Star Control III, the K‚Äôtang are portrayed as an intellectually inferior species using advanced technology they do not fully understand to intimidate people, perhaps explaining why their translators‚Äô output is littered with misspellings and nonstandard usages of words, like threatening to ‚Äúcrushify‚Äù the player. Along the same lines, the Daktaklakpak dialogue is highly stilted and contains many numbers and mathematical expressions, implying that, as a mechanical race, their thought processes are inherently too different from humans‚Äô to be directly translated into human language. =Stargate= In the television shows Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, there are no personal translation devices used, and most alien and Human cultures on other planets speak English. The makers of the show have themselves admitted this on the main SG-1 site, stating that this is to save spending ten minutes an episode on characters learning a new language (early episodes of SG-1 revealed the difficulties of attempting to write such processes into the plot). In the season 8 finale of SG-1, ‚ÄúMoebius (Part II),‚Äù the characters go back in time to 3000 B.C. and one of them teaches English to the people there. A notable exception to this rule are the Goa‚Äôuld, who occasionally speak their own language amongst themselves or when giving orders to their Jaffa. This is never subtitled, but occasionally a translation is given by a third character (usually Teal‚Äôc or Daniel Jackson), ostensibly for the benefit of the human characters nearby who do not speak Goa‚Äôuld. The Asgard are also shown having their own language (apparently related to the Norse languages), although it is English played backwards. (See Hermiod). In contrast a major plot element of the original Stargate film was that Daniel Jackson had to learn the language of the people of Abydos in the common way, which turned out to be derived from ancient Egyptian. The language had been extinct on Earth for many millennia, but Jackson eventually realized that it was merely errors in pronunciation that prevented effective communication. =Star Trek= In Star Trek, the universal translator was used by Ensign Hoshi Sato, the communications officer on the Enterprise in Star Trek: Enterprise, to invent the linguacode matrix. It was supposedly first used in the late 22nd century on Earth for the instant translation of well-known Earth languages. Gradually, with the removal of language barriers, Earth's disparate cultures came to terms of universal peace. Translations of previously unknown languages, such as those of aliens, required more difficulties to be overcome. Like most other common forms of Star Trek technology (warp drive, transporters, etc.), the universal translator was probably developed independently on several worlds as an inevitable requirement of space travel; certainly the Vulcans had no difficulty communicating with humans upon making \\"first contact\\" (although the Vulcans could have learned Standard English from monitoring Earth radio transmissions). The Vulcan ship that landed during First Contact was a survey vessel. The Vulcans had been surveying the humans for over a hundred years, when first contact actually occurred to T'Pol's great-grandmother, T'mir, in the episode \\"Carbon Creek\\"; however, in Star Trek First Contact it is implied that they learned English by surveying the planets in the Solar System. Deanna Troi mentions the Vulcans have no interest in Earth as it is \\"too primitive\\", but the Prime Directive states not to interfere with pre-Warp species. The Vulcans only noticed the warp trail and came to investigate. Improbably, the universal translator has been successfully used to interpret non-biological lifeform communication (in the Original Series episode \\"Metamorphosis\\"). In the Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) episode \\"The Ensigns of Command\\", the translator proved ineffective with the language of the Sheliaks, so the Federation had to depend on the aliens' interpretation of Earth languages. It is speculated that the Sheliak communicate amongst themselves in extremely complex legalese. The TNG episode \\"Darmok\\" also illustrates another instance where the universal translator proves ineffective and unintelligible, because the Tamarian language is too deeply rooted in local metaphor. Unlike virtually every other form of Federation technology, universal translators almost never break down. A notable exception is in the Star Trek: Discovery episode \\"An Obol for Charon\\", where alien interference causes the translator to malfunction and translate crew speech and computer text into multiple languages at random, requiring Commander Saru's fluency in nearly one hundred languages to repair the problem. Although universal translators were clearly in widespread use during this era and Captain Kirk's time (inasmuch as the crew regularly communicated with species who could not conceivably have knowledge of Standard English), it is unclear where they were carried on personnel of that era. The episode \\"Metamorphosis\\" was the only time in which the device was actually seen. In the episode \\"Arena\\" the Metrons supply Captain Kirk and the Gorn commander with a Translator-Communicator, allowing conversation between them to be possible. During Kirk's era, they were also apparently less perfect in their translations into Klingon. In the sixth Star Trek film, the characters are seen relying on print books in order to communicate with a Klingon military ship, since Chekov said that the Klingons would recognize the use of a Translator. Actress Nichelle Nichols reportedly protested this scene, as she felt that Uhura, as communications officer during what was effectively a cold war, would be trained in fluent Klingon to aid in such situations. In that same movie during the trial scene of Kirk and McCoy before a Klingon judiciary, the Captain and the Doctor are holding communication devices while a Klingon (played by Todd Bryant) translates for them. The novelization of that movie provided a different reason for the use of books: sabotage by somebody working on the Starfleet side of the conspiracy uncovered by the crew in the story, but the novelization is not part of the Star Trek canon. By the 24th century, universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by Starfleet personnel, although there were instances when crew members (such as Riker in the Next Generation episode \\"First Contact\\") spoke to newly encountered aliens even when deprived of their communicators. In the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"The 37's\\" the device apparently works among intra- species languages as well; after the Voyager crew discovers and revives eight humans abducted in 1937 (including Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan) and held in stasis since then, a Japanese Army officer expresses surprise that an Ohio farmer is apparently speaking Japanese, while the farmer is equally surprised to hear the soldier speaking English (the audience hears them all speaking English only, however). Certain Starfleet programs, such as the Emergency Medical Hologram, have universal translators encoded into the programming. The Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual says that the universal translator is an \\"extremely sophisticated computer program\\" which functions by \\"analyzing the patterns\\" of an unknown foreign language, starting from a speech sample of two or more speakers in conversation. The more extensive the conversational sample, the more accurate and reliable is the \\"translation matrix\\", enabling instantaneous conversion of verbal utterances or written text between the alien language and American English / Federation Standard.Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (introduction by Gene Roddenberry), p. 101. Simon & Schuster, 1991. In some episodes of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, we see a Cardassian universal translator at work. It takes some time to process an alien language, whose speakers are initially not understandable but as they continue speaking, the computer gradually learns their language and renders it into Standard English (also known as Federation Standard). Ferengi customarily wear their universal translators as an implant in their ears. In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) episode \\"Little Green Men\\", in which the show's regular Ferengi accidentally become the three aliens in Roswell, the humans without translators are unable to understand the Ferengi (who likewise can not understand the English spoken by the human observers) until the Ferengi get their own translators working. Similarly, throughout all Trek series, a universal translator possessed by only one party can audibly broadcast the results within a limited range, enabling communication between two or more parties, all speaking different languages. The devices appear to be standard equipment on starships and space stations, where a communicator pin would therefore presumably not be strictly necessary. Since the Universal Translator presumably does not physically affect the process by which the user's vocal cords (or alien equivalent) forms audible speech (i.e. the user is nonetheless speaking in his/her/its own language regardless of the listener's language), the listener apparently hears only the speaker's translated words and not the alien language that the speaker is actually, physically articulating; the unfamiliar oratory is therefore not only translated but somehow replaced. The universal translator is often used in cases of contact with pre-warp societies such as in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\", and its detection could conceivably lead to a violation of the Prime Directive. Therefore, logically there must be some mechanism by which the lips of the speaker are perceived to be in sync with the words spoken. No explanation of the mechanics of this function appears to have been provided, the viewer is required to suspend disbelief enough to overcome the apparent limitation.  Non-fictional translators  Microsoft is developing its own translation technology, for incorporation into many of their software products and services. Most notably this includes real-time translation of video calls with Skype Translator. As of July 2019, Microsoft Translator supports over 65 languages and can translate video calls between English, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin), Italian, and Spanish. In 2010, Google announced that it was developing a translator. Using a voice recognition system and a database, a robotic voice will recite the translation in the desired language. Google's stated aim is to translate the entire world's information. Roya Soleimani, a spokesperson for Google, said during a 2013 interview demonstrating the translation app on a smartphone, \\"You can have access to the world's languages right in your pocket... The goal is to become that ultimate Star Trek computer.\\" The United States Army has also developed a two-way translator for use in Iraq. TRANSTAC (Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use), though, only focuses on Arabic-English translation. The United States Army has scrapped the TRANSTAC Program and is developing in conjunction with DARPA, the BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) in its place. In February 2010, a communications software called VoxOx launched a two-way translator service for instant messaging, SMS, email and social media titled the VoxOx Universal Translator. It enables two people to communicate instantly with each other while both typing in their native languages.

These jokes about people, generally women, who have blonde hair serve as a form of blonde versus brunette rivalry. They are often considered to be derogatory as many are mere variants on traditional ethnic jokes or jests about other identifiable groups that would be considered more offensive (such as Italian jokes involving Carabinieri). In some cases, jokes about stereotypically stupid people have circulated since the seventeenth century with only the wording and targeted groups changed.Giselinde Kuipers, Good Humor, Bad Taste: A Sociology of the Joke, page 24, Walter de Gruyter, 2006, Some blonde jokes rely on sexual humour to portray or stereotype their subjects as promiscuous.Karen Ross, The Handbook of Gender, Sex and Media, chapter 6, John Wiley & Sons, 2011, Many of these are rephrased sorority girl or Essex girl jokes, much as other jokes about dumb blondes are based on long- running ethnic jokes. Common traits Blonde jokes nearly always take the format of the blonde placing herself in a situation or making a comment that serves to highlight her supposed promiscuity and/or lack of intelligence, cluelessness and clumsiness. The blonde of the joke is often placed in an unusual situation with a brunette or redhead. The emergence of a class of meta-jokes about blondes (\\"meta-blonde jokes\\", i.e., jokes about blonde jokes) is noted. In a typical plot of this type a blonde complains about the unfairness of the stereotype propagated by blonde jokes, with a punch line actually reinforcing the stereotype.Limor Shifman, Dafna Lemish, \\"Virtually Blonde: Blonde Jokes in the Global Age and Postfeminist Discourse\\", in: The Handbook of Gender, Sex and Media An example is about a blonde objecting to a ventriloquist act packed with sexist jokes about blondes: The British Essex girl joke, very similar in content, became popular in the late 1980s; it satirises working-class girls from the county of Essex. Criticism Like all humour based on stereotypes, blonde jokes are considered offensive to many people, particularly women. However, blonde jokes, unlike jokes that target minorities, do appear in mainstream media such as newspapers and television. Blonde jokes have been criticized as sexist by several authors, largely because the target is invariably dim-witted, female and sexually promiscuous.

He was the only legitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, and converted to the Roman Catholicism in 1712 to secure his candidacy for the Polish throne. In 1719 he married Maria Josepha, daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, and became Elector of Saxony following his father's death in 1733. Augustus was able to gain the support of Charles VI by agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and also gained recognition from Russian Empress Anna by supporting Russia's claim to the region of Courland. He was elected king of Poland by a small minority on 5 October 1733 and subsequently banished the former Polish king Stanis≈Çaw I. He was crowned in Krak√≥w on 17 January 1734. Augustus was supportive of Austria against Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession (1742) and again in the Seven Years' War (1756), both of which resulted in Saxony being defeated and occupied by the Prussian Kingdom. In Poland, his rule was marked by the increasing influence of the Czartoryski and Poniatowski families, and by the intervention of Catherine the Great in Polish affairs. His rule deepened the social anarchy in Poland and increased the country's dependence on its neighbours, notably Prussia, Austria and Russia. The Russian Empire prevented him from installing his family on the Polish throne, supporting instead the aristocrat Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, the lover of Catherine the Great. Throughout his reign, Augustus was known to be more interested in ease and pleasure than in the affairs of state; this notable patron of the arts left the administration of Saxony and Poland to his chief adviser, Heinrich von Br√ºhl, who in turn left Polish administration chiefly to the powerful Czartoryski family.

His mother was Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, daughter of Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg- Bayreuth. Unlike his father, Christiane remained a fervent Protestant throughout her life and never set foot in Catholic Poland during her 30-year service as queen consort. Despite the pressure from Augustus II, she was never crowned at Wawel in Krak√≥w and purely held a titular title of queen.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660‚Äì1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) This move was viewed by the Polish nobility as a provocation and from the beginning the prince was treated with prejudice in Poland. Prince Frederick Augustus, by Louis de Silvestre, 1727 From his early years Augustus was groomed to succeed as king of Poland-Lithuania; best tutors were hired from across the continent and the prince studied Polish, German, French and Latin.Jacek Staszewski, August III Sas, Wroc≈Çaw, 2010, p. 27‚Äì29, 70 (in Polish) He was taught Russian, but was unable to speak it fluently,Staszewski, Op. cit., p. 28 as well as exact sciences including mathematics, chemistry and geography. He also practiced equestrianism in his youth. While his father spent time in Poland, the young Augustus was left in the care of his grandmother, Princess Anna Sophie of Denmark, who initially raised him Lutheran. This was particularly unfavourable for the Poles, who wouldn't accept or tolerate a Protestant monarch. As a consequence, troubled Augustus II organized a tour of Catholic countries in Europe for his son which he hoped would bring him closer to Catholicism and break the bond between him and his controlling grandmother. In Venice, the Polish entourage thwarted a kidnapping attempt organized by British agents of Queen Anne in order to prevent him from converting. He also witnessed the coronation of Charles VI in 1711 after the death of his brother and predecessor, Joseph I. Augustus eventually converted to Roman Catholicism in November 1712 while extensively touring Italy, and its cultural and religious heritage. He was then under the supervision of the Jesuits, who certainly contributed to the cause. The public announcement of conversion in 1717 triggered discontent among the Protestant Saxon aristocracy... Faced with a hereditary Catholic succession for Saxony, Prussia and Hanover attempted to oust Saxony from the directorship of the Protestant body in the Reichstag of the Holy Roman Empire, but Saxony managed to retain the directorship. Reception of Augustus at Versailles by Louis XIV, 1714 On 26 September 1714, Augustus was warmly welcomed by Louis XIV of France at Versailles. Louis rejoiced when he heard that Augustus converted to Catholicism and permitted him to stay at the royal court and in Paris. The young prince participated in balls, masquerades and private parties that were hosted by the Sun King himself. During this time, Augustus improved his knowledge of the French language and learnt how to approach politics and diplomacy. In June 1715, he departed Versailles and travelled across France, visiting Bordeaux, Moissac, Toulouse, Carcassonne, Marseille and Lyon. Apart from sightseeing, the purpose of this trip was to understand how cities and villages function. Being brought up in great wealth, Augustus was not entirely aware of how extensive poverty and poor living conditions can be in the countryside. =Marriage and wedding= Maria Josepha at the Zwinger Palace in Dresden, 1719 On 20 August 1719, Augustus married Maria Josepha Habsburg in Vienna. She was the daughter of the deceased Emperor Joseph I and niece of Charles VI of the Holy Roman Empire, whose coronation young Augustus attended. This marriage wasn't coincidental; Augustus II the Strong orchestrated it to maintain the might of the Saxons within the Holy Roman Empire. The alliance with Catholic Charles would prove fruitful in case of hostile or armed opposition from the Protestant states within the Empire. Ten day earlier, on 10 August 1719, Maria Josepha was forced to renounce her claim to the throne of Austria in favour of her uncle's daughter, Maria Theresa. In accordance with the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 issued by Charles, a female heir or the eldest daughter would be permitted to inherit the throne of Austria. Augustus II also hoped to place Saxony in a better position should there arise a war of succession to the Austrian territories. Royal Monogram of King Augustus III of Poland. The wedding celebration in Dresden was one of the most splendorous and expensive of the Baroque era in Europe. Over 800 guests were invited for a 2-week celebration. The main banquet was held in a chamber that was transformed into an artificial silver mine to astound the invitees. Apart from exotic dishes, over 500 deer were brought in from the Bia≈Çowie≈ºa Forest for the feast. Approximately 4 million thalers were spent for this occasion. =Succession= Coronation mantle of Augustus III, National Museum in Warsaw Augustus II died suddenly on 1 February 1733, following a Sejm (Polish parliament) session in Warsaw. Augustus III inherited the Saxon electorate and, but his election to the Polish throne was much more complicated. Shortly before the ailing king died, Prussia, Austria and Russia signed a pact known as the Treaty of the Three Black Eagles, which would prevent Augustus III and Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski from inheriting the Polish throne. The royal elections in Poland and the elective monarchy in general weakened the country and allowed other powers to meddle into Polish affairs. The neighbouring countries that signed the treaty preferred a neutral monarch like Infante Manuel, Count of Our√©m, brother of John V of Portugal, or any living relative of the Piast dynasty. The agreement had provisions for all three powers to agree that it was in their best interest that their common neighbour, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, did not undertake any reforms that might strengthen it and trigger expansionism. The new king would also have to maintain friendly relations with these countries. The treaty quickly became ineffective as Prussia began to support Leszczy≈Ñski and allowed him safe passage from France to Poland through German lands. As a result, Austria and Russia signed on 19 August 1733 the L√∂wenwolde's Treaty, named after Karl Gustav von L√∂wenwolde. The terms of L√∂wenwolde's Treaty were direct; Russia opted for a quid pro quo ‚Äì they would provide troops to ensure Augustus III is elected king and in turn Augustus would recognise Anna Ivanovna as Empress of Russia, thus relinquishing Polish claims to Livonia and Courland.That effectivity meant supporting the rule of Ernest Biron, a Russian court favourite. Corwin, Edward Henry Lewinski (1917) The Political History of Poland Polish Book Importing Company, New York, page 288, Ragsdale, Hugh (1993) Imperial Russian foreign policy Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, page 32-33, Austria received a promise that as king, Augustus would both renounce any claim to the Austrian succession and continue respecting the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713.Corwin, Edward Henry Lewinski (1917) The political History of Poland Polish Book Importing Company, New York, page 286-288, =War of the Polish Succession= Royal Polish Regalia of Augustus III, made around the time of the Succession War Augustus on his candidacy to the Polish throne was opposed by Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski (Stanislaus I), who had usurped the throne with Swedish support during the Great Northern War. Reigning from 1706 until 1709, Stanis≈Çaw was overthrown after the Swedish defeat at Poltava. Returning from exile in 1733 with the support of Louis XV of France and Spain, Stanis≈Çaw sparked the War of the Polish Succession. Throughout the spring and summer of 1733, France began mobilizing and stationing forces along its northern and eastern borders, while Austria massed troops on the Polish frontier, reducing garrisons in the Duchy of Milan for the purpose. Prince Eugene of Savoy recommended to the emperor a more warlike posture against its longtime rival, France. He suggested that the Rhine valley and northern Italy should be strengthened with more troops, however only minimal steps were taken to improve imperial defenses on the Rhine. In July 1733, Augustus agreed to Austria's and Russia's terms per L√∂wenwolde's Treaty. During the election sejm in August, Russian troops counting 30,000 men under the command of Peter Lacy entered Poland to secure Augustus' succession. The election was de jure won by Stanis≈Çaw, with 12,000 votes. Augustus received 3,000, however he had the support of Poland's influential, wealthiest and most corrupt magnates, such as Michael Servacy Wi≈õniowiecki. The Franco-Spanish coalition declared war on Austria and Saxony on 10 October. The Italian states of Savoy-Sardinia and Parma also joined the struggle against Austrian rule in northern Italy. Most of the battles took place outside of Poland and the main focus of the war was personal interests and demonstration of superiority. The Russian-Saxon forces chased Stanis≈Çaw until he was besieged at Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) on 22 February 1734. In June, when the garrisons at Gda≈Ñsk surrendered, Stanis≈Çaw fled to K√∂nigsberg and then back to France. The Pacification Sejm in 1736 de facto confirmed Augustus III as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania. To this day, the aphorism and phrase od Sasa do Lasa (lit. from the Saxon to Leszczy≈Ñski) exists in the Polish language and is used when describing two completely opposite things in everyday life. =Reign and diplomacy= Poland von Br√ºhl exhibiting his extravagant Meissen porcelain. Br√ºhl was the viceroy of Poland and headed the Saxon court As King, Augustus was uninterested in the affairs of his Polish‚ÄìLithuanian dominion, focusing instead on hunting, the opera, and the collection of artwork at the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister. He spent less than three years of his thirty-year reign in Poland, where political feuding between the House of Czartoryski and the Potocki paralyzed the Sejm (Liberum veto), fostering internal political anarchy and weakening the Commonwealth. Augustus delegated most of his powers and responsibilities in the Commonwealth to Heinrich von Br√ºhl, who served in effect as the viceroy of Poland. Br√ºhl in turn left the politics in Poland to the most powerful magnates and nobles, which resulted in widespread corruption. Under Augustus, Poland was not involved in any major conflicts which further lessened its position in Europe and allowed the neighbouring countries to take advantage of the disorder. Any opposition was violently crushed by Br√ºhl, who used either Saxon or Russian forces that permanently stationed in the country. Br√ºhl was a skillful diplomat and strategist; Augustus could only be reached through him if an important political feud arose. He was also the head of the Saxon court in Dresden and was fond of collectibles, such as gadgets, jewellery and Meissen porcelain, the most famous being the Swan Service composed of 2,200 individual pieces made between 1737 and 1741. It has been described as possibly \\"the finest table service ever produced\\" and part of it are exhibited at the National Museum in Warsaw. He also owned the largest collections of watches, vests, wigs and hats in Europe, though this cannot be accurately assessed. Br√ºhl was depicted by his rivals as a nouveau-riche materialist, who used his wealth to gain support. His lavish spending was immortalized by Augustus' reported question to the viceroy \\"Br√ºhl, do I have money?\\" By 1748 Augustus III completed extending the Saxon Palace in Warsaw and made significant contributions in remodelling the Royal Castle. In 1750, von Br√ºhl purchased a residence adjacent to the larger Saxon Palace and transformed it into a rococo masterpiece, which later became known as the Br√ºhl Palace. Both buildings were completely destroyed by the Nazis during World War II. War of the Austrian Succession Neumarkt in 1747, by Bernardo Bellotto With the marriage to Austrian princess Maria Josepha, Augustus was bound to accept the succession of her cousin, Maria Theresa, as Holy Roman Empress. Saxony mediated between the friendly French faction and the Habsburg faction of Maria Theresa. Between 1741 and 1742 Saxony was allied with France, but changed sides with the help of Austrian diplomats. In the first days of December 1740, the Prussians assembled along the Oder river and on 16 December, Frederick invaded Silesia without a formal declaration of war. The Austrian troops which then stationed in Silesia were poorly supplied and outnumbered as the Habsburgs concentrated their supreme force on Hungary and Italy. They held onto the fortresses of Glogau, Breslau, and Brieg, but abandoned the rest of the region and withdrew into Moravia. This campaign gave Prussia control of most of the richest province in the Habsburg Empire, with the commercial centre of Breslau as well as mining, weaving and dyeing industries. Silesia was also rich in natural resources such as coal, chalk, copper and gold. Rotari, 1755 Saxony joined Austria in the Second Silesian War, which erupted after Prussia proclaimed to keep Charles VII as Holy Roman Emperor and invaded Bohemia on 15 August 1744. The true cause behind the invasion was Frederick's personal expansionist ideas and goals. On 8 January 1745, the Treaty of Warsaw united Great Britain, the Habsburg Monarchy, the Dutch Republic and Saxony into what became known as the \\"Quadruple Alliance\\", which was aimed at securing the Austrian throne for Maria Theresa. Soon-after Charles VII died of gout in Munich, which weakened the Prussians. However, Prussia still maintained military superiority; the successful battles of Hennersdorf and Kesselsdorf opened the way to Dresden, which Frederick occupied on 18 December. The Treaty of Dresden was eventually completed on Christmas Day (25 December) and Saxony was obliged to pay one million rixdollars in reparations to the Prussian state. The treaty ended the Second Silesian War with a status quo ante bellum. Maria Theresa was finally recognized as Empress with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, which proved a Pyrrhic victory for Augustus III, however, the conflict nearly bankrupted Saxony. Meanwhile, the affairs in Poland remained highly neglected. Seven Years' War The Electorate of Saxony was involved in the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763. The Saxons were allied with Austria and Russia against Frederick the Great of Prussia, who saw Saxony as another potential field for expansion. Saxony was then merely a buffer zone between Prussia and Austrian Bohemia as well as Silesia, which Frederick attempted to annex in their entirety. Moreover, Saxony and Poland were separated by a strip of land in Silesia and Lusatia which made the movement of troops even more difficult. Frederick's plans also entailed annexing Duchy of Hanover, but joining the France would trigger an Austro-Russian attack and occupation. On 29 August 1756, the Prussian army preemptively invaded Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War, a theatre of the Seven Years' War. Saxony was bled dry and exploited at maximum extent to support Prussia's war effort. The Treaty of Hubertusburg signed on 15 February 1763 ended the conflict with Frederick's victory and Saxony renounced its claim to Silesia. =Death= In April 1763, Augustus returned ill and frail from Poland to Dresden with his closest advisors, leaving Primate W≈Çadys≈Çaw Aleksander ≈Åubie≈Ñski behind to take care of the affairs in the Commonwealth. He died suddenly on 5 October 1763 in Dresden from apoplexy (stroke). Unlike his father who rests at Wawel in Krak√≥w, Augustus III was buried at Dresden Cathedral and remains one of the few Polish monarchs who were buried outside of Poland. Augustus's eldest surviving son, Frederick Christian of Saxony, succeeded his father as Elector. A Russian-supported coup d'√©tat in Poland, instigated by the Czartoryskis, resulted in the election of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski as king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania on 7 September 1764. Reigning under the name Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, Poniatowski was the son of the elder Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, a powerful Polish noble and a onetime agent of Stanis≈Çaw I; he was a lover of Catherine II of Russia and as such enjoyed strong support from that Empress's court. Legacy =Patron of arts= Saxon Facade of the Royal Castle in Warsaw Augustus III was a great patron of the arts and architecture. During his reign the Baroque Catholic Church of the Royal Court in Dresden (present- day Dresden Cathedral) was built, in which he was later buried as one of the few Polish kings buried outside the Wawel Cathedral in Krak√≥w. He greatly expanded the Dresden art gallery, to the extent that in 1747 it was placed in a new location at the present-day Johanneum, where it remained until 1855, when it was moved to the newly built Semper Gallery. In 1748 he founded the Opera House (Operalnia) in Warsaw and the Collegium medico-chirurgicum, the first medical school in Dresden. During his reign, the extension of the Saxon Palace in Warsaw, begun by his father Augustus II, was completed, and the reconstruction of the eastern fa√ßade of the Royal Castle was ordered, thus creating the so-called Saxon Facade, an iconic part of the Vistula panorama of the Warsaw Old Town. Meissen porcelain figure of King Augustus III In 1733, the composer Johann Sebastian Bach dedicated the Kyrie‚ÄìGloria Mass in B minor, (early version), to Augustus in honor of his succession to the Saxon electorate, with the hope of appointment as Court Composer, a title Bach received three years later. Bach's title of Koeniglicher Pohlnischer Hoff Compositeur (Royal Polish Court Composer, and court composer to the Elector of Saxony) is engraved on the title page of Bach's famous Goldberg Variations. Augustus III was also the patron of composer Johann Adolph Hasse, who was granted the title of the Royal-Polish and Electoral-Saxon Kapellmeister by his father, Augustus II, in 1731, and thanks to Augustus III the same title was obtained in 1716 by composer Johann David Heinichen. =Personal life and criticism= Donors to the General Hospital of Infant Jesus; Augustus III is in the top left corner, 18th-century depictions In 1732, a French priest named Gabriel Piotr Baudouin founded the first orphanage in Poland, situated in Warsaw's Old Town. The facility was later moved to the nearby Warecki Square (now Warsaw Uprising Square), and in 1768 Augustus III decreed that the new institution is to be called Szpital Generalny DzieciƒÖtka Jezus (The General Hospital of Infant Jesus). The newly established hospital expanded its operations into treating not only orphans, but also the sick and the poor. Augustus remained a charitable man throughout his life and donated to the hospital. His successor, Stanis≈Çaw Augustus, also contributed to the cause. Despite his charitable manner, Augustus was viewed in Poland as an impotent monarch, obese, plump, ugly and a lazy sybarite with no interest in the affairs of state. Such harsh critique and opinion continues to this day. On the other hand, historian Jacek Staszewski was able to find a description of Augustus' character in the Dresden archives in the late 1980s; he was considered an honest and affectionate man, who was widely respected during his reign by both the Saxons and the Poles. In his personal life, Augustus was a devoted husband to Maria Josepha, with whom he had sixteen children. Unlike his father who was a notorious womanizer, he was never unfaithful and enjoyed spending time with his spouse, uncommon among the royalty in those days. He also favoured hunting. Depictions Augustus III was portrayed by Ernst Dernburg in the 1941 film Friedemann Bach. Issue On 20 August 1719, Augustus married Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, the eldest child of Joseph I, the Holy Roman Emperor. They had sixteen children, but only fourteen or fifteen are recognized by historians: * Frederick Augustus Franz Xavier (born Dresden, 18 November 1720 ‚Äì died Dresden, 22 January 1721) * Joseph Augustus Wilhelm Frederick Franz Xavier Johann Nepomuk (born Pillnitz, 24 October 1721 ‚Äì died Dresden, 14 March 1728) * Frederick Christian Leopold Johann Georg Franz Xavier (born Dresden, 5 September 1722 ‚Äì died Dresden, 17 December 1763), successor to his father as Elector of Saxony * Unknown stillborn daughter (Dresden, 23 June 1723) * Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga (born Dresden, 24 November 1724 ‚Äì died Buen Retiro, 27 September 1760); married on 19 June 1738 to Charles VII, King of Naples, later King Charles III of Spain * Maria Margaretha Franziska Xaveria (born Dresden, 13 September 1727 ‚Äì died Dresden, 1 February 1734), died in childhood. * Maria Anna Sophie Sabina Angela Franziska Xaveria (born Dresden, 29 August 1728 ‚Äì died Munich, 17 February 1797); married on 9 August 1747 to Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria * Unknown child (1729‚Äì1730) * Franz Xavier Albert August Ludwig Benno (born Dresden, 25 August 1730 ‚Äì died Dresden, 21 June 1806), Regent of Saxony (1763‚Äì1768) * Maria Josepha Karolina Eleonore Franziska Xaveria (born Dresden, 4 November 1731 ‚Äì died Versailles, 13 March 1767); married on 9 February 1747 to Louis, Dauphin of France (1729‚Äì1765), son of Louis XV of France (she was the mother of Kings Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X) of France * Karl Christian Joseph Ignaz Eugen Franz Xavier (born Dresden, 13 July 1733 ‚Äì died Dresden, 16 June 1796), Duke of Courland and Zemgale (1758‚Äì1763) * Maria Christina Anna Teresia Salomea Eulalia Franziska Xaveria (born Warsaw, 12 February 1735 ‚Äì died Brumath, 19 November 1782), Princess-Abbess of Remiremont. * Maria Elisabeth Apollonia Casimira Francisca Xaveria (born Warsaw, 9 February 1736 ‚Äì died Dresden, 24 December 1818), died unmarried. * Albert Kasimir August Ignaz Pius Franz Xavier (born Moritzburg, near Dresden, 11 July 1738 ‚Äì died Vienna, 10 February 1822), Duke of Teschen and Governor of the Austrian Netherlands (1781‚Äì1793) * Clemens Wenceslaus August Hubertus Franz Xavier (born Schloss Hubertusburg, Wermsdorf, 28 September 1739 ‚Äì died Marktoberdorf, Allg√§u, 27 July 1812), Archbishop of Trier * Maria Kunigunde Dorothea Hedwig Franziska Xaveria Florentina (born Warsaw, 10 November 1740 ‚Äì died Dresden, 8 April 1826), Princess-Abbess of Thorn and Essen Gallery File:August III.jpgPortrait of Crown Prince Augustus File: August III the Saxon in Polish costume.PNGAugustus III in Sarmatian costume, by Louis de Silvestre, c.1737 File:Coat of arms of Augustus III of Poland as vicar of the Holy Roman Empire.svgCoat of arms of Augustus III of Poland as vicar of the Holy Roman Empire File:POL JS Mock Wjazd Augusta III do Warszawy.jpgEntry of Augustus III into Warsaw by Johann Samuel Mock File:K√∂ler Regalia of Augustus III and Maria Josepha.jpgCrown Regalia of King Augustus and Maria Josepha File:POLAND, DANZIG (GDANSK), AUGUSTUS III 1763 -6 GROSCHEN a - Flickr - woody1778a.jpg6 groschen, 1763 Ancestry See also * History of Saxony * History of Poland (1569‚Äì1795) * Rulers of Saxony * List of Lithuanian rulers * Dresden Castle ‚Äì Residence of Augustus III Notes and references External links * . 1696 births 1763 deaths 18th-century Polish monarchs Electoral Princes of Saxony Nobility from Dresden Electors of Saxony Grand Dukes of Lithuania Imperial vicars House of Wettin Converts to Roman Catholicism from Lutheranism Polish Roman Catholics Burials at Katholische Hofkirche Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle Recipients of the Order of St. Andrew Polish military personnel of the War of the Polish Succession People of the Silesian Wars Albertine branch ","title":"Augustus III of Poland"},{"id":"247730","text":"The greater bulldog bat or fisherman bat (Noctilio leporinus) is a type of fishing bat native to Latin America (Spanish: Murci√©lago pescador). The bat uses echolocation to detect water ripples made by the fish upon which it preys, then uses the pouch between its legs to scoop the fish up and its sharp claws to catch and cling to it. It is not to be confused with the lesser bulldog bat, which, though belonging to the same genus, merely catches water insects, such as water striders and water beetles. It emits echolocation sounds through the mouth like Myotis daubentoni, but the sounds are quite different, containing a long constant frequency part around 55 kHz, which is an unusually high frequency for a bat this large. General description The greater bulldog bat is a large bat, often with a combined body and head length of . It generally weighs from 50‚Äì90 grams. Males tend to be larger than females, with the former averaging 67 grams and the latter averaging 56 grams. They also differ in fur color. Males have bright orange fur on the back while females are dull gray. However, both sexes have pale undersides and may have a pale line that runs down the middle of the back. The males do not have a baculum. The bulldog bat has rounded nostrils that open forward and down. It has elongated, pointed ears with a tragus that gets ridged at the outer edge. The bulldog bat has smooth lips but its upper lip is divided by a skin fold while its bottom lip has a wart above skin folds that extend to the chin. It is these features that give the bulldog bat gets its name, as it resembles a bulldog. The bulldog bat has a wingspan of . The wing of the bat is longer than the head and body combined and 65% of its wingspan is made of the third digit. When in flight, the bat's wings move slowly. This species is a capable swimmer and will use its wings to paddle. The greater bulldog bat also has prominent cheek pouches which are useful for holding its food. Its hind legs and feet are particularly large. Distribution and variation The greater bulldog bats range stretches from Mexico to Northern Argentina and also includes most Caribbean islands. While vast, its range is also patchy as the bat is limited to mostly well-watered lowland and coastal areas as well as river basins. There is geographical variation in the species and are classified as subspecies. Bats around the Caribbean Basin are large and usually have the pale mid-dorsal stripe, despite varying in pelage. These bats are known as N. l. mastivus. In Guianas and the Amazon Basin, the bats are small and dark and often lack the pale mid-dorsal stripe. These bats are known as N. l. leporinus. In eastern Bolivia, southern Brazil and northern Argentina bats tend to be large and pale, more so than the other subspecies. They are known as N. l. rufenscenes. Ecology and behavior The greater bulldog bat lives primarily in tropical lowlands. The bats are commonly found over ponds and streams as well as estuaries and coastal lagoons. They live in colonies that number in the hundreds. In Trinidad, bulldog bats rest in hollow trees like silk-cotton, red mangrove and balat√°. The bats live in hollow tree roosts in other areas as well. They also roost in deep sea caves. Like most bats, bulldog bats are nocturnal. Female bulldog bats stay together in groups while roosting and tend to be accompanied by a resident male. Females associate with the same individuals in the same location for several years unaffected by changes in resident males and movements of the group to different roosts. A male may stay with a female group for two or more reproductive seasons. Bachelor males are segregated from the females and may roost alone or together in small groups. Female bats forage either alone or with their roost mates, with stable female groups continue to forage in the same areas in the long term. Males forage alone and use areas that are larger and separate from those used by the females. =Food and hunting= The greater bulldog bat is one of the few bat species that has adapted to eating fish. Nevertheless, the bats eat both fish and insects. During the wet season, the bats feed primarily on insects like moths and beetles. During the dry season, bat will primarily feed on fish as well as crabs, scorpions and shrimp to a lesser extent. The bulldog bat mostly forages for fish during high tide and locates them with echolocation. A bulldog bat will fly high in the air and in a circular direction when searching for prey. If it spots a jumping fish, the bat will drop down closer to the water surface, particularly the spot where it made the jump and decreases the pulse duration and intervals of its echolocation signals. The bulldog bat may also search by dragging its feet across the water surface, a behavior known as raking. The bat may rake through areas where fish jumping is most frequent or in areas where it had previously made a successful catch. =Echolocation= Greater bulldog bats emit echolocation signals that are either at constant frequency (CF), frequency-modulated (FM) or a combination of the two (CF-FM). The longest signals are the pure CF signal which typically last 13.3 ms but can go as long as 17 ms. CF-FM signals have CF followed by a FM. In an CF-FM signal, the CF are typically 8.9 ms with a frequency of 52.8‚Äì56.2 kHz while the FM ranges up to 3.9 ms with 25.9 kHz bandwidth. Bulldog bats have two kinds of signal when flying. In one, the CF pulses begin at 60 kHz of frequency and may fall no further than 50 kHz. The second type has the CF starting at a frequency of 60 kHz and then falls for more than a single octave. =Reproduction cycle= For females, pregnancy occurs from September until January, and lactation starts in November and continues until April. Only one young is born each gestation. Male bats mostly breed autumn and winter. Young bats stay in the roosts for one month and are then capable of flight. Both the male and female care for the young. Status While the bulldog bat is not in danger overall, the bat is nevertheless threatened by water pollution, persecution, changing water levels and deforestation.Barquez, R., Perez, S., Miller, B. & Diaz, M. 2008.

Echolocation, development, and vocal communication in the lesser bulldog bat, Noctilio albiventris. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 13(4), 287-298 As they skim across the water they will bombard the water with their vocalization and when they detect a disturbance of the vocalization they move to the disturbance. Additionally, since the lesser bulldog bat prefers to forage in small groups they also use echolocation to communicate during foraging.  Development and lifespan  They live about ten years and reach sexual maturity in one year.Lundrigan B., & Kamarainen A., (2003). Noctilio albiventris lesser bulldog bat. https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Noctilio_albiventris/ Ovulation occurs in the ovary the gestation period lasts about 4 to 5 weeks. Baby bats are capable of very limited vocalization, and they cannot begin flight until 5 to 6 weeks after birth. Mother bats will feed their young until the babies are three months old.  Predators  Predation on bats is uncommon however large birds are known to prey upon bats.Camargo, P. H. S. A., & Laps, R. R., (2016).

The bath brick (also known as Patent Scouring or Flanders bricks), patented in 1823 by William Champion and John Browne, was a predecessor of the scouring pad used for cleaning and polishing. Bath bricks were made by a number of companies in the town of Bridgwater, England, from fine clay dredged from the River Parrett near Dunball. The silt, which was collected from the river on either side of the Town Bridge, contained fine particles of alumina and silica. It was collected from beds of brick rubble left in the rain for the salt to be washed out and then put into a \\"pugging mill\\" which was powered by a horse to be mixed, before being shaped into moulds and dried. These would be wrapped in paper and boxed for sale in England and throughout the British Empire. By the end of the 19th century around 24 million bath bricks had been produced in Bridgwater for the home and international markets. The brick, similar in size to an ordinary house brick, could be used in a number of ways. A mild abrasive powder could be scraped from the brick and used as a scouring powder on floors and other surfaces. Powder could also be moistened with water for use on a cloth for polishing or as a kind of sand paper. Items such as knives might be polished directly on a wetted brick.

A typical convention used in aeronautics is to define transonic flight as speeds in the range of Mach 0.72 to 1.0 ( at sea level). This condition depends not only on the travel speed of the craft, but also on the temperature of the airflow in the vehicle's local environment. It is formally defined as the range of speeds between the critical Mach number, when some parts of the airflow over an air vehicle or airfoil are supersonic, and a higher speed, typically near Mach 1.2, when most of the airflow is supersonic. Between these speeds some of the airflow is supersonic, but a significant fraction is not. Most modern jet powered aircraft are engineered to operate at transonic air speeds. Transonic airspeeds see a rapid increase in drag from about Mach 0.8, and it is the fuel costs of the drag that typically limits the airspeed. Attempts to reduce wave drag can be seen on all high-speed aircraft. Most notable is the use of swept wings, but another common form is a wasp-waist fuselage as a side effect of the Whitcomb area rule. Severe instability can occur at transonic speeds. Shock waves can cause large-scale separation downstream, increasing drag and adding asymmetry and unsteadiness to the flow around the vehicle. Research has been done into weakening shock waves in transonic flight through the use of anti-shock bodies and supercritical airfoils. Transonic speeds can also occur at the tips of rotor blades of helicopters and aircraft. This puts severe, unequal stresses on the rotor blade and may lead to accidents if it occurs. It is one of the limiting factors of the size of rotors and the forward speeds of helicopters (as this speed is added to the forward-sweeping [leading] side of the rotor, possibly causing localized transonics). Condensation clouds At transonic speeds supersonic expansion fans form intense low-pressure, low-temperature areas at various points around an aircraft. If the temperature drops below the dew point a visible cloud will form. These clouds remain with the aircraft as it travels. It is not necessary for the aircraft as a whole to reach supersonic speeds for these clouds to form. Typically, the tail of the aircraft will reach supersonic flight while the bow of the aircraft is still in subsonic flight. A bubble of supersonic expansion fans terminating by a wake shockwave surround the tail. As the aircraft continues to accelerate, the supersonic expansion fans will intensify and the wake shockwave will grow in size until infinity is reached, at which point the bow shockwave forms. This is Mach 1 and the Prandtl‚ÄìGlauert singularity. Transonic flows in astronomy and astrophysics In astrophysics, wherever there is evidence of shocks (standing, propagating or oscillating), the flow close by must be transonic, as only supersonic flows form shocks. All black hole accretions are transonic. Many such flows also have shocks very close to the black holes. The outflows or jets from young stellar objects or disks around black holes can also be transonic since they start subsonically and at a far distance they are invariably supersonic. Supernovae explosions are accompanied by supersonic flows and shock waves. Bow shocks formed in solar winds are a direct result of transonic winds from a star. It has been long thought that a bow shock was present around the heliosphere of our solar system. This was recently found not to be the case according to IBEX data..

The Bible documents the instruments played by the ancient Hebrews, all of which are correlated in Egyptian archaeology. Egyptian music probably had a significant impact on the development of ancient Greek music, and via the Greeks was important to early European music well into the Middle Ages. Egyptian modern music is considered as a main core of Middle Eastern and Oriental music as it has a very big influence on the region due to the popularity and huge influence of Egyptian Cinema and Music industries. The tonal structure of Oriental Middle Eastern music is defined by the maqamat, loosely similar to the Western modes, while the rhythm of Middle Eastern music is governed by the iqa'at, standard rhythmic modes formed by combinations of accented and unaccented beats and rests. History The ancient Egyptians credited the goddess Bat with the invention of music. The cult of Bat was eventually syncretised into that of Hathor because both were depicted as cows. Hathor's music was believed to have been used by Osiris as part of his effort to civilise the world. The lion-goddess Bastet was also considered a goddess of music. =Neolithic period= In prehistoric Egypt, music and chanting were commonly used in magic and rituals. Rhythms during this time were unvaried and music served to create rhythm. Small shells were used as whistles. =Predynastic period= During the predynastic period of Egyptian history, funerary chants continued to play an important role in Egyptian religion and were accompanied by clappers or a flute. Despite the lack of physical evidence in some cases, Egyptologists theorise that the development of certain instruments known of the Old Kingdom period, such as the end-blown flute, took place during this time. =Old Kingdom= The evidence for instruments played is more securely attested in the Old Kingdom when harps, flutes and double clarinets were played. Percussion instruments and lutes were added to orchestras by the Middle Kingdom. Cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance, much as they still do in Egypt today. =Medieval music= Early Middle Eastern music was influenced by Byzantine and Persian forms, which were themselves heavily influenced by earlier Greek, Semitic, and Ancient Egyptian music. Egyptians in Medieval Cairo believed that music exercised \\"too powerful an effect upon the passions, and leading men into gaiety, dissipation and vice.\\" However, Egyptians generally were very fond of music. Though, according to E.W. Lane, no \\"man of sense\\" would ever become a musician, music was a key part of society. Tradesmen of every occupation used music during work and schools taught the Quran by chanting. The music of Medieval Egypt was derived from Greek and Persian traditions. Lane said that \\"the most remarkable peculiarity of the Arab system of music is the division of tones into thirds,\\" although today Western musicologists prefer to say that Arabic music's tones are divided into quarters. The songs of this period were similar in sound and simple, within a small range of tones. Egyptian song, though simple in form, is embellished by the singer. Distinct enunciation and a quavering voice are also characteristics of Egyptian singing. Male professional musicians during this period were called Alateeyeh (plural), or Alatee (singular), which means \\"a player upon an instrument\\". However, this name applies to both vocalists as well as instrumentalists. This position was considered disreputable and lowly. However, musicians found work singing or playing at parties to entertain the company. They generally made three shillings a night, but earned more by the guests' givings. Female professional musicians were called Awalim (pl) or Al‚Äômeh, which means a learned female. These singers were often hired on the occasion of a celebration in the harem of a wealthy person. They were not with the harem, but in an elevated room that was concealed by a screen so as not to be seen by either the harem or the master of the house. The female Awalim were more highly paid than male performers and more highly regarded than the Alateeyeh as well. Lane relates an instance of a female performer who so enraptured her audience that she earned up to fifty guineas for one night's performance from the guests and host, themselves not considered wealthy. =Modern Egyptian classical and pop music= In the second half of the 19th century, the Hasaballah genre of popular improvisational brass band folk music emerged, initiated by clarinettist Mohammad Hasaballah and his band, also called Hasaballah, playing in Cairo's music and entertainment quarter on Mohammed Ali Street. The typical line-up of trumpet, trombone, bass and snare drums, was popular, such as at family events, for well over a century, and is still played.Egypt: Hasaballah, the People's Music, Al Jazeera, 22 Nov 2017Hasaballah Music: The Past and The Present , The Community Times, 24 May 2016 Egyptian music began to be recorded in the 1910s when Egypt was still part of the Ottoman Empire. The cosmopolitan Ottomans encouraged the development of the arts, encouraging women and minorities to develop their musical abilities. By the fall of the Empire, Egypt's classical musical tradition was already thriving, centered on the city of Cairo. In general, modern Egyptian music blends its indigenous traditions with Turkish and western elements. Since the end of World War I, some of the Middle East's biggest musical stars have been Egyptian. Contemporary Egyptian music traces its beginnings to the creative work of luminaries such as Abdu-l Hamuli, Almaz and Mahmud Osman, who were all patronized by the Ottoman Khedive Ismail, and who influenced the later work of the 20th century's most important Egyptian composers: Sayed Darwish, Umm Kulthum, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Abdel Halim Hafez, and Zakariya Ahmed. Most of these stars, including Umm Kulthum and Nagat El-Saghira, were part of the traditional Egyptian music. Some, like Abd el-Halim Hafez, were associated with the Egyptian nationalist movement from 1952 onward. Cairo-born Fatma Said was the first Egyptian soprano to sing at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan, and from 2016-2018 took part in BBC Radio 3 New Generation Artists scheme. Western classical music Cairo Opera House, a landmark in the cultural landscape of Egypt and the Middle East Western classical music was introduced to Egypt, and, in the middle of the 18th century, instruments such as the piano and violin were gradually adopted by Egyptians. Opera also became increasingly popular during the 18th century, and Giuseppe Verdi's Egyptian-themed Aida was premiered in Cairo on December 24, 1871. By the early 20th century, the first generation of Egyptian composers, including Yusef Greiss, Abu Bakr Khairat, and Hasan Rashid, began writing for Western instruments. The second generation of Egyptian composers included notable artists such as Gamal Abdelrahim. Representative composers of the third generation are Ahmed El-Saedi and Rageh Daoud. In the early 21st century, even fourth generation composers such as Mohamed Abdelwahab Abdelfattah (of the Cairo Conservatory) have gained international attention. Religious music in Egypt Religious music remains an essential part of traditional Sufi Muslim and Coptic Christian celebrations called mulids. Mulids are held in Egypt to celebrate the saint of a particular church. Muslim mulids are related to the Sufi zikr ritual. The Egyptian flute, called the ney, is commonly played at mulids. The liturgical music of the Alexandrian Rite also constitutes an important element of Egyptian music and is said to have preserved many features of ancient Egyptian music. Folkloric music Egyptian folk music, including the traditional Sufi dhikr rituals, are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient Egyptian music, having preserved many of its features, rhythms and instruments. Folk and roots revival The 20th century has seen Cairo become associated with a roots revival. Musicians from across Egypt are keeping folk traditions alive, such as those of rural Egyptians (fellahin), the Saii'da, and to a lesser extent minorities like the Siwa people, the Egyptian Gypsies, the Sinawis and the Nubians. Mixtures of folk and pop have also risen from the Cairo hit factory. Since the Nasser era, Egyptian pop music has become increasingly important in Egyptian culture, particularly among the large youth population of Egypt. Egyptian folk music continues to be played during weddings and other traditional festivities. In the last quarter of the 20th century, Egyptian music was a way to communicate social and class issues. Among some of the most popular Egyptian pop singers today are Mohamed Mounir and Amr Diab. Sawahli (coastal) music is a type of popular Egyptian music from the country's northern coast, and is based around ancient Egyptian instrumentals, mainly the simsimiyya, which is an indigenous stringed instrument. Well-known singers include Abdo El-Iskandrani and Eid El- Gannirni. =Saidi (Upper Egyptian)= Egyptian musicians from Upper Egypt play a form of folk music called ·π¢a‚Äòƒ´di which originates from Upper Egypt). Discovered in 1975 by Alain Weber, Metqal Qenawi's Les Musiciens du Nil ( Musicians of the Nile) are the most popular saidi group, and were chosen by the government to represent Egyptian folk music abroad. They spent over three decades touring Europe performing at various festivals and musical events and in 1983 after their performance in the World of Music and Dance Festival, they were signed to Peter Gabriel's label Real World-Carolina and went on to feature on his Album Passion. Other performers include Shoukoukou, Ahmad Ismail, Omar Gharzawi, Sohar Magdy and Ahmed Megahid. =Nubian= In Egypt, Nubians are native to southern part of Aswan, though some live in Cairo, Alexandria and other cities. Nubian folk music can still be heard, but migration and intercultural contact with Egyptian and other musical genres have produced new innovations. Ali Hassan Kuban's efforts had made him a regular on the world music scene, while Mohamed Mounir's social criticism and sophisticated pop have made him a star among Nubians, Egyptians, and other people worldwide. Ahmed Mounib, Mohamed Mounir's mentor, was by far the most notable Nubian singer to hit the Egyptian music scene, singing in both Egyptian Arabic as well as in his native Nobiin. Hamza El Din was another popular Nubian Egyptian artist, well known on the world music scene and has collaborated with the Kronos Quartet. Egyptian musical instruments A typical contemporary Egyptian ensemble compromising the Oud, qanun, violin, ney and cello. During the Abbasid and Ottoman dynasty Egypt was one of the main musical hubs in the middle east and therefore after the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1923 Egypt became the capital of Arabic music where classical instruments such as the oud, qanun and ney were widely used. The typical takht (ensemble) consisted of an Oud player, qanun player, ney player and violin player. The takht (literally meaning a sofa) was the most common form of ensembles in the early 20th century before the adoption of more orchestral instruments which were introduced by composers such as Mohamed El Qasabgi, Riad El Sunbati and Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Electronic music One of the most respected early electronic music composers, Halim El-Dabh, is an Egyptian. However, the Egyptian electronic music scene has only gained a mainstream foothold recently in the form of techno, trance and dance pop DJs such as Aly & Fila. In the 2010s, Shaabi music, a form of electronic music which often contains political lyrics, gained popularity both inside and outside music. Reconstruction of ancient Egyptian music In the early 21st century, interest in the music of the pharaonic period began to grow, inspired by the research of such foreign-born musicologists as Hans Hickmann. By the early 21st century, Egyptian musicians and musicologists led by the musicology professor Khairy El-Malt at Helwan University in Cairo had begun to reconstruct musical instruments of Ancient Egypt, a project that is ongoing.Ancient Egyptian Music Symposium File:Broken Sistrum (1890) - TIMEA.jpgBroken Egyptian Sistrum File:C+B-Music- Fig5-EgyptianSistrum.PNGEgyptian Sistrum File:Louvres-antiquites- egyptiennes-p1010937.jpgCollection of sistrums at the Louvre File:Egyptian - Sistrum - Walters 541207.jpgFrom the Walters Art Museum, 380‚Äì250 BC File:C+B-Music-Fig8-EgyptianLongFlute.PNGAncient Egyptian Long Flute File:C+B-Music-Fig22-EgyptianStringedInstruments.PNGAncient Egyptian Stringed Instruments File:C+B-Music-Fig2-EgyptianWithTwoSidedDrum.PNGAncient Egyptian With TwoSided Drum File:C+B-Music-Fig26-EgyptianBand.PNGAncient Egyptian Music Band File:C+B-Music-Fig15-LateStyleEgyptianLyre.PNGLate Style Egyptian Lyre File:C+B-Music-Fig1-EgyptianWomanPlayingDrum.PNGAncient Egyptian Woman Playing Drum File:C+B-Music-Fig14-PeopleWithEgyptianLyre.PNGEgyptian Lyre See also * Egyptian contemporary art Notes and references Further reading *Lodge, David and Bill Badley. \\"Partner of Poetry\\". 2000.

Its course is marked by rapids, impeding navigation southwest of Fort McMurray. Numerous communities are located on the banks of the Athabasca River, including Jasper, Brule, Entrance, Hinton, Whitecourt, Fort Assiniboine, Smith, Athabasca, Fort McMurray, and Fort McKay. =Tributaries= ;Alberta's Rockies *Habel Creek *Warwick Creek *Quincy Creek *Chaba River *Dragon Creek *Sunwapta River *Ranger Creek *Fryatt Creek **Lick Creek *Geraldine Lakes *Kerkeslin Creek *Hardisty Creek *Whirlpool River *Astoria River *Portal Creek *Wabasso Creek *Whistlers Creek *Tekerra Creek *Miette River *Pyramid Lake *Maligne River *Garonne Creek *Snaring River *Morro Creek *Cobblestone Creek *Corral Creek *Jacques Creek *Rocky River *Snake Indian River *Mountain Creek *Fiddle River *Supply Creek *Oldhouse Creek *Prine Creek *Maskuta Creek ;Central Alberta *Hardisty Creek *Fish Creek *Cache Petotte Creek *Tiecamp Creek *Canyon Creek *Ponoka Creek *Plante Creek **Apetowun Creek *Obed Creek *Oldman Creek *Nosehill Creek *Jackpine Creek *Berland River **Wildhay River *Beaver Creek *Marsh Head Creek *Pine Creek *Pass Creek *Two Creek *Windfall Creek *Chickadee Creek *Bessie Creek *Stony Creek *Sakwatamau River *McLeod River ;Northern Alberta *Freeman River *Timeu Creek *Pembina River *Lesser Slave River *Lawrence Lake Creek *Baptiste Lake Creek *Tawatinaw River *La Biche River *Calling River *McMillan Lake Creek *Parallel Creek *Pelican River *House River *Horse River *Clearwater River *Steepbank River *Muskeg River *Mackay River *Ells River *Firebag River *Richardson River History Sekani, Shuswap, Kootenay, Salish, Stoney, and Cree tribes hunted and fished along the river prior to European colonization in the 18th century. From about 1778, the Athabasca River, the Clearwater River, which enters the Athabasca River from the east at Fort McMurray, and the Methye Portage were part of a primary fur trade route from the Mackenzie River to the Great Lakes (see Canadian Canoe Routes (early)).A Hudson's Bay Company scow in the Athabasca River, c. 1910 David Thompson and Thomas the Iroquois traveled through Athabasca Pass in 1811. In 1862, the Athabasca Springs area was crossed during the Cariboo Gold Rush by the Overlander Party. The northern segment of the Athabasca River became part of a major shipping network in 1921 when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached Waterways near Fort McMurray, making it the northernmost point on the North American railroad grid at that time. Cargo for destinations farther north was shipped to Waterways and transferred to barges, after which fleets of tugboats took them up the river to destinations in the Athabasca and Mackenzie River watersheds. Barge traffic declined after 1964 when Hay River, on the Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, became the northern terminus of the rail grid. Environmental concerns Owing to its proximity to the Athabasca oil sands, the river has seen significant amounts of energy infrastructure constructed along its course. On June 6, 1970, a pipeline operated by Great Canadian Oil Sands, the precursor to Suncor and the earliest commercial extraction operation, ruptured near the banks of the river. The total spill volume was estimated by Great Canadian Oil Sands at approximately 1,190 barrels of oil.Province of Alberta, Alberta Government Committee Report on Great Canadian Oil Sands Oil Spill to Athabasca River June 6, 1970, Edmonton: Alberta Government, 1970. Page 3. An independent study has concluded that the Athabasca River contains elevated levels of pollution downstream of the Athabasca oil sands. Testing has shown this portion of the river contains mercury, lead, and 11 other toxic elements. =Coal mine spill= On October31, 2013, one of the Obed Mountain coal mine pits failed, and from between 600 million to a billion liters of slurry poured into the Plante and Apetowun Creeks. The plume of waste products then joined the Athabasca River, travelling downstream for a month before settling in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan, over away. =Heritage= The river was designated a Canadian Heritage River for its importance to the fur trade and the construction of railways and roads opening up the Canadian West, as well as for its natural heritage. The Canadian Heraldic Authority named the position of Athabaska Herald after the river.

It also includes music produced by people of Chinese origin in some territories outside mainland China using traditional Chinese instruments or in the Chinese language. It covers a highly diverse range of music from the traditional to the modern. Different types of music have been recorded in historical Chinese documents from the early periods of Chinese civilization which, together with archaeological artifacts discovered, provided evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the Zhou dynasty (1122 BC ‚Äì 256 BC). These further developed into various forms of music through succeeding dynasties, producing the rich heritage of music that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today. Chinese music continues to evolve in the modern times, and more contemporary forms of music have also emerged.  History  Chinese ceramic statues from the Eastern Han period (25‚Äì220 AD), Shanghai Museum According to legends, the founder of music in Chinese mythology was Ling Lun who, at the request of the Yellow Emperor to create a system of music, made bamboo pipes tuned to the sounds of birds including the phoenix. A twelve-tone musical system was created based on the pitches of the bamboo pipes, the first of these pipes produced the \\"yellow bell\\" (ÈªÉÈêò) pitch, and a set of tuned bells were then created from the pipes. =Early history= bone flute from Henan Archaeological evidence indicates that music culture developed in China from a very early period. Excavations in Jiahu Village in Wuyang County, Henan found bone flutes dated to 9,000 years ago, and clay music instruments called Xun thought to be 7,000 years old have been found in the Hemudu sites in Zhejiang and Banpo in Xi'an. A set of bronze bells called bianzhong 5th century B.C. from Hubei During the Zhou dynasty, a formal system of court and ceremonial music later termed yayue (meaning \\"elegant music\\") was established. Note that the word music (Ê®Ç, yue) in ancient China can also refer to dance as music and dance were considered integral part of the whole, and its meaning can also be further extended to poetry as well as other art forms and rituals. The word \\"dance\\" (Ëàû) similarly also referred to music, and every dance would have had a piece of music associated with it. The most important set of music of the period was the Six-dynasty Music Dance (ÂÖ≠‰ª£Ê®ÇËàû) performed in rituals in the royal court. Music in the Zhou Dynasty was conceived as a cosmological manifestation of the sound of nature integrated into the binary universal order of yin and yang, and this concept has enduring influence later Chinese thinking on music. \\"Correct\\" music according to Zhou concept would involve instruments correlating to the five elements of nature and would bring harmony to nature. Around or before the 7th century BC, a system of pitch generation and pentatonic scale was derived from a cycle-of-fifths theory. Chinese philosophers took varying approaches to music. To Confucius, a correct form of music is important for the cultivation and refinement of the individual, and the Confucian system considers the formal music yayue to be morally uplifting and the symbol of a good ruler and stable government. Some popular forms of music, however, were considered corrupting in the Confucian view. Mozi on the other hand condemned making music, and argued in Against Music (ÈùûÊ®Ç) that music is an extravagance and indulgence that serves no useful purpose and may be harmful. According to Mencius, a powerful ruler once asked him whether it was moral if he preferred popular music to the classics. The answer was that it only mattered that the ruler loved his subjects. In ancient China the social status of musicians was much lower than that of painters, though music was seen as central to the harmony and longevity of the state. Almost every emperor took folk songs seriously, sending officers to collect songs to record the popular culture. One of the Confucianist Classics, The Classic of Poetry, contained many folk songs dating from 800 BC to about 400 BC. =Qin to Qing dynasty= A mural from the tomb of Xu Xianxiu in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, dated 571 AD during the Northern Qi Dynasty, showing male court musicians playing stringed instruments, either the liuqin or pipa, and a woman playing a konghou (harp) The Imperial Music Bureau, first established in the Qin dynasty (221‚Äì207 BC), was greatly expanded under the emperor Han Wudi (140‚Äì87 BC) and charged with supervising court music and military music and determining what folk music would be officially recognized. In subsequent dynasties, the development of Chinese music was influenced by the musical traditions of Central Asia which also introduced elements of Indian music.A History of Sino-Indian Relations: 1st Century A.D. to 7th Century A.D. by Yukteshwar Kumar. p.76 Journal of Music in China, Volume 4, p.4 Instruments of Central Asian origin such as pipa were adopted in China, the Indian Heptatonic scale was introduced in the 6th century by a musician from Kucha named Sujiva, although the heptatonic scale was later abandoned.India and China: Interactions through Buddhism and Diplomacy: A Collection of Essays by Professor Prabodh Chandra Bagchi . p.210 History of Civilizations of Central Asia edited by Unesco A half-section of the Song dynasty (960-1279) version of the Night Revels of Han Xizai, the original was by Gu Hongzhong in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-960);Patricia Ebrey (1999), Cambridge Illustrated History of China, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 148. the female musicians in the center of the image are playing transverse bamboo flutes and guan, and the male musician is playing a wooden clapper called paiban. The oldest extant written Chinese music is \\"Youlan\\" (ÂπΩËò≠) or the Solitary Orchid, composed during the 6th or 7th century, but has also been attributed to Confucius. The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the qin during the Tang dynasty (618-907AD), though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty. This is based on the conjecture that because the recorded examples of Chinese music are ceremonial, and the ceremonies in which they were employed are thought to have existed \\"perhaps more than one thousand years before Christ\\", the musical compositions themselves were performed, even in 1000 BC, in precisely the manner prescribed by the sources that were written down in the seventh century AD. (It is based on this conjecture that Van Aalst dates the \\"Entrance Hymn for the Emperor\\" to c. 1000 BC.) Yangguan Sandie [Three Refrains on the Yang Pass Theme], one of the great Tang masterpieces found in the Qinxue Rumen (1867) played on qin. Through succeeding dynasties over thousands of years, Chinese musicians developed a large assortment of different instruments and playing styles. A wide variety of these instruments, such as guzheng and dizi are indigenous, although many popular traditional musical instruments were introduced from Central Asia, such as the erhu and pipa. The presence of European music in China appeared as early as 1601 when the Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci presented a Harpsichord to the Ming imperial court, and trained four eunuchs to play it.Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music ‚Äî CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. . During the late Qing dynasty era, the influence of Western music began to be felt. = Republic of China era (1912‚Äì1949) = Blind Chinese Street Musician - Beijing (1930) The earliest forms of the 1935 March of the Volunteers anthem in the Denton Gazette newspaper The New Culture Movement of the 1910s and 1920s produced a great deal of lasting interest in Western music. A number of Chinese musicians returned from studying abroad to perform Western classical music, composing work hits on Western musical notation system. The Kuomintang tried to sponsor modern music adoptions via the Shanghai Conservatory of Music despite the ongoing political crisis. Twentieth-century cultural philosophers like Xiao Youmei, Cai Yuanpei, Feng Zikai and Wang Guangqi wanted to see Chinese music adopted to the best standard possible. There were many different opinions regarding the best standard. Symphony orchestras were formed in most major cities and performed to a wide audience in the concert halls and on radio. Many of the performers added jazz influences to traditional music, adding xylophones, saxophones and violins, among other instruments. L√º Wencheng, Qui Hechou, Yin Zizhong and He Dasha were among the most notable performers and composers of this period. In Shanghai, a popular genre of music called shidaiqu emerged in the 1920s. Shidaiqu is a fusion of Chinese and Western popular music, and Li Jinhui is considered to be founder of the genre. Popular singers in this genre in the 1930s and 1940s included Zhou Xuan, Li Xianglan and Yao Lee. After the 1942 Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, a large-scale campaign was launched in the Communist controlled areas to adapt folk music to create revolutionary songs to educate the largely illiterate rural population on party goals. Musical forms considered superstitious or anti-revolutionary were repressed, and harmonies and bass lines were added to traditional songs. One example is The East Is Red, a folksong from northern Shaanxi which was adapted into a nationalist hymn. Of particular note is the composer, Xian Xinghai, who was active during this period, and composed the Yellow River Cantata which is the most well-known of all of his works. = 1949‚Äì1990s = The golden age of shidaiqu and the Seven great singing stars would come to an end when the Communist party denounced Chinese popular music as yellow music (pornography).Broughton, Simon. Ellingham, Mark. Trillo, Richard. [2000] (2000) World Music: The Rough Guide. Rough Guides Publishing Company. . Maoists considered pop music as a decline to the art form in mainland China. In 1949 the Kuomintang relocated to Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China was established. Revolutionary songs would become heavily promoted by the state. The Maoists, during the Cultural Revolution, pushed revolutionary music as the only acceptable genre; because of propaganda, this genre largely overshadowed all others and came almost to define mainland Chinese music. This is still, in some ways, an ongoing process, but some scholars and musicians (Chinese and otherwise) are trying to revive old music. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a new fast tempo Northwest Wind (xibeifeng, Ë•øÂåóÈ¢®) style was launched by protesters to counter the government. The music would progress into Chinese rock, which remained popular in the 1990s. However, music in China is very much state-owned as the TV, media, and major concert halls are all controlled by the Communist party. The government mainly chose not to support Chinese rock by limiting its exposure and airtime. As a result, the genre never reached the mainstream in its entirety. = 2000s‚Äìpresent = Annual events such as the Midi Modern Music Festival in Beijing attracts tens of thousands of visitors. There was also the \\"Snow Mountain Music Festival\\" in Yunnan province 2002. Today, rock music is centered on almost exclusively in Beijing and Shanghai, and has very limited influence over Chinese society. Wuhan and Sichuan are sometimes considered pockets of rock music culture as well. It points to a significant cultural, political and social difference that exist between China, the West, or even different parts within China. While rock has existed in China for decades, the milestone that put the genre on the international map is when Cui Jian played with The Rolling Stones in 2003, at the age of 42. China has also become a destination of major Western rock and pop artists; many foreign acts have toured in China and performed in multiple concerts in recent decades, including Beyonce, Eric Clapton, Nine Inch Nails, Avril Lavigne, Linkin Park and Talib Kweli. Mainland China has a high piracy rate along with issues of intellectual properties.BuildingIPvalue. \\"BuildingIPvalue.\\" Recent developments in intellectual property. Retrieved on 2007-04-04. Normally there is some delay before the products are released into mainland China, with occasional exceptions, such as the work of Cui Jian who was released in Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China simultaneously.Gunde, Richard. [2002] (2002) Culture and Customs of China. Greenwood Press. . Consequently, a delay in release time is also the biggest driver of piracy, since individuals would rather pirate from the outside. The modern market is not only hindered by rights issues, as there are many other factors such as profit margin, income and other economical questions. In 2015, the digital music market in China was expected to be worth . In 2015 China had the 14th largest music market in the world, with revenues of . As of 2016 there were 213 music charts in China. Also as of 2016, the three largest music streaming and download services in China are KuGou, with a 28% share of the market, QQ Music with 15% and Kuwo with 13%. China is expected to become one of the largest music markets in the world by 2020.  Traditional music  = Instrumental = Musical instruments were traditionally classified into 8 categories known as bayin. Traditional music in China is played on solo instruments or in small ensembles of plucked and bowed stringed instruments, flutes, and various cymbals, gongs, and drums. The scale is pentatonic. Bamboo pipes and qin are among the oldest known musical instruments from China; instruments are traditionally divided into categories based on their material of composition: animal skins, gourd, bamboo, wood, silk, earth/clay, metal, and stone. Chinese orchestras traditionally consist of bowed strings, woodwinds, plucked strings and percussion. The Moon reflecting in Erquan Pool, a masterpiece written for erhu by the blind composer Abing.

Chinese vocal music has traditionally been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in falsetto and is usually solo rather than choral. All traditional Chinese music is melodic rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an erhu or dizi are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the pipa and zheng music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The qin is perhaps the most revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or seen and heard one being played. The zheng, a form of zither, is most popular in Henan, Chaozhou, Hakka areas, and Shandong. The pipa, a kind of lute, believed to have been introduced from the Arabian Peninsula area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in Shanghai and surrounding areas. = Music of the Han culture = People of the Han ethnic group make up about 92% of the population of China. Han people's music consists of heterophonic music, in which the musicians play versions of a single melodic line. Percussion accompanies most music, dance, talks, and opera. Han Folk Music had many aspects to it regarding its meaning, feelings, and tonality. This genre of music, in a sense, is similar to the Chinese language. This relationship is made by tones, sliding from higher tones to lower tones, or lower to higher tones, or a combination of both. These similarities mean that the instrument is a very important part in mastering technique with both left and right hands (left hand is used to create tonality on the string, right hand is for plucking or strumming the string), particularly for the classical (literati) tradition. Sometimes, singing can be put into the music to create a harmony or a melody accompanying the instrument. Han Chinese Folk's feelings are displayed in its poetry-like feeling to it with slow soothing tempos that express feelings that connect with the audience or whoever is playing the piece. Han folk music uses silences that alter its meaning, creating a sound similar to poetry. Performers in Peking Opera. = Chinese opera = Chinese opera has been a popular form of entertainment for many centuries, from the Nanxi of Song dynasty to the Peking opera of today. The music is often guttural with high- pitched vocals, usually accompanied by suona, jinghu, other kinds of string instruments, and percussion. Other types of opera include clapper opera, Pingju, Cantonese opera, puppet opera, Kunqu, Sichuan opera, Qinqiang, ritual masked opera and Huangmei xi. = Folk music = According to current archaeological discoveries, Chinese folk music dates back 7000 years. Not only in form but also in artistic conception, China has been the home of a colorful culture of folk music. Largely based on the pentatonic scale, Chinese folk music is different from western traditional music, paying more attention to the form expression as well. Han traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of oboe called a suona and percussive ensembles called chuigushou. Ensembles consisting of mouth organs (sheng), shawms (suona), flutes (dizi) and percussion instruments (especially yunluo gongs) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of Beijing, Xi'an, Wutai shan and Tianjin. Xi'an drum music, consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the sheng, pipes, an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western free reed instruments, such as the accordion. Parades led by Western-type brass bands are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band. In southern Fujian and Taiwan, Nanyin or Nanguan is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a xiao and a pipa, as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken woman. Further south, in Shantou, Hakka areas, and Chaozhou, erxian and zheng ensembles are popular. Sizhu ensembles use flutes and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in Nanjing and Hangzhou, as well as elsewhere along the southern Yangtze area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas. Jiangnan Sizhu (silk and bamboo music from Jiangnan) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in Shanghai; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin. Guangdong Music or Cantonese Music is instrumental music from Guangzhou and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories and myths, maybe legends.  Regional music  Miao musicians playing free-reed instruments in Guizhou China has many ethnic groups besides the Han, who reside in various regions around the nation. These include Tibetans, Uyghurs, Manchus, Zhuang, Dai, Mongolians, Naxi, Miao, Wa, Yi, and Lisu. = Guangxi = Guangxi is a region of China, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Its most famous performer of Guangxi is the legendary Zhuang folksinger, Âàò‰∏âÂßê () or Third Sister Liu, born in Guangxi during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) and who was the subject of the 1961 film, Liu Sanjie which introduced Guangxi's culture to the rest of the world. Zhuang folk songs and Han Chinese music are a similar style, and are mostly in the pentatonic scale. The lyrics have an obvious antithesis format. They frequently contain symbols and metaphors, and common themes include life experiences as well as allusions to classical Chinese stories. The Jing or Gin people (ethnic Vietnamese) are one of the smallest populations of ethnic and the only coastal fishery ethnic minority of China. They are known for their instrument called duxianqin (lit. \\"single string zither\\"), a string instrument with only one string, said to date back to the 8th century. = Hong Kong = The music of Hong Kong notably includes the Cantonese Chinese pop music known as cantopop. = Hua'er = Hua'er is a form of traditional a cappella singing that is popular in the mountainous northwestern Chinese provinces such as Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. = Inner Mongolia = Mongolian folk songs have a \\"long tune\\" and a \\"short tune\\". The Mongolians have a variety of stringed instruments such as morin khuur or horsehead fiddle. It is named because of its headstock carving of a horse used as decoration on the pillar. = Korean = There are Korean communities scattered across northeast China. Chinese Korean music and North/South Korea music are basically the same. The main instruments are the long drum and the Gayageum. The Gayageum is similar to the ancient Chinese zither, which was smaller than the modern zither. The playing methods are different also. = Kuaiban = Kuaiban (Âø´Êùø) is a type of rhythmic talking and singing which is often performed with percussive instruments such as a clapper called paiban. The center of the kuaiban tradition is Shandong province. Kuaiban bears some resemblance to rap and other forms of rhythmic music found in other cultures. = Northeast China = Northeast China is a region inhabited by ethnic groups like the Manchu. The most prominent folk instrument is the octagonal drum, while the youyouzha lullaby is also well-known. = Sichuan = Sichuan is a province in southwest China. Its capital city, Chengdu, is home to the only musical higher education institution in the region, the Sichuan Conservatory of Music. The province has a long history of Sichuan opera. = Tibet = Monks playing Tibetan horns Music forms an integral part of Tibetan Buddhism. While chanting remains perhaps the best known form of Tibetan Buddhist music, complex and lively forms are also widespread. Monks use music to recite various sacred texts and to celebrate a variety of festivals during the year. The most specialized form of chanting is called yang, which is without metrical timing and is dominated by resonant drums and sustained, low syllables. Other forms of chanting are unique to Tantra as well as the four main monastic schools: Gelugpa, Kagyupa, Nyingmapa and Sakyapa. Of these schools, Gelugpa is considered a more restrained, classical form, while Nyingmapa is widely described as romantic and dramatic. Gelugpa is perhaps the most popular. Secular Tibetan music survived the Cultural Revolution more intact than spiritual music, especially due to the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts, which was founded by the Dalai Lama shortly after his exile. TIPA originally specialized in the operatic lhamo form, which has since been modernized with the addition of Western and other influences. Other secular genres include nangma and toshe, which are often linked and are accompanied by a variety of instruments designed for highly rhythmic dance music. Nangma karaoke is popular in modern Lhasa. A classical form called gar is very popular, and is distinguished by ornate, elegant and ceremonial music honoring dignitaries or other respected persons. Tibetan folk music includes a cappella lu songs, which are distinctively high in pitch with glottal vibrations, as well as now rare epic bards who sing the tales of Gesar, Tibet's most popular hero. Tibetan music has influenced the pioneering compositions of Philip Glass and, most influentially, Henry Eichheim. Later artists made new-age fusions by pioneers Henry Wolff and Nancy Hennings. These two collaborated on Tibetan Bells, perhaps the first fusion of New Age and Tibetan influences, in 1971. Glass' Kundun soundtrack proved influential in the 1990s, while the popularity of Western-adapted Buddhism (exemplified by Richard Gere, Yungchen Lhamo, Steve Tibbetts, Choying Drolma, Lama Karta and Kitaro and Nawang Khechong) helped further popularize Tibetan music. In the mid- to late 1980s, a relaxation of governmental rules allowed a form of Tibetan pop music to emerge in Tibet proper. Direct references to native religion is still forbidden, but commonly understood metaphors are widespread. Pure Tibetan pop is heavily influenced by light Chinese rock, and includes best-sellers like Jampa Tsering and Yatong. Politically and socially aware songs are rare in this form of pop, but commonplace in a second type of Tibetan pop. Nangma karaoke bars appeared in 1998 and are common in Lhasa, in spite of threats from the Chinese government. = Xinjiang = Uyghur Meshrep musicians in Yarkand. Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is dominated by Uyghurs, a Turkic people related to other Turkic groups from Central Asia. The Uyghurs' best-known musical form is the On Ikki Muqam, a complex suite of twelve sections related to Uzbek and Tajik forms. These complex symphonies vary wildly between suites in the same muqam, and are built on a seven-note scale. Instruments typically include dap (a drum), dulcimers, fiddles and lutes; performers have some space for personal embellishments, especially in the percussion. The most important performer is Turdi Akhun, who recorded most of the muqams in the 1950s. = Yunnan = Nakhi musicians Yunnan is an ethnically diverse area in southwest China. Perhaps best known from the province is the lusheng, a type of mouth organ, used by the Miao people of Guizhou for pentatonic antiphonal courting songs. The Hani of Honghe Prefecture are known for a unique kind of choral, micro-tonal rice- transplanting songs. The Nakhi of Lijiang play a type of song and dance suite called baisha xiyue, which was supposedly brought by Kublai Khan in 1253. Nakhi Dongjing is a type of music related to southern Chinese forms, and is popular today. The Dai ethnic musical styles are similar to those of South Asia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Some typical Dai instruments are the hulusi and the elephant-foot drum.  Modern changes  In the early 20th century after the end of Imperial China, there were major changes to traditional Chinese music as part of the New Culture Movement. Much of what Westerners and even Chinese now consider to be music in the traditional Chinese style can be dated to this period and is in fact less than 100 years old. The modernization of Chinese music involved the adoption of some aspects of Western forms and values, such as the use of Western conservatory system of teaching, and changes to the instruments and their tuning, the composition, the orchestration of music, the notation system and performance style. Some forms of Chinese music however remained traditional and are little changed. = National music = The term guoyue, or national music, became popular in the early 20th century and was used loosely to include all music written for Chinese instruments in response to a particular nationalistic consciousness. The term however may have a slightly different meaning when used by different Chinese communities. It was originally used only to refer to the music of the Han Chinese; it later began to include music of various ethnic minorities in China. In the Republic of China in Taiwan, Guoyue emphasized music of the mainland China over the Taiwanese local traditions. In mainland China a new term minyue (Ê∞ë‰πê, short for minzu yinyue or \\"people's music\\") was coined post-1949 in place of guoyue to encompass all compositions and genres for traditional instruments. In other Chinese communities, it may also be referred to as huayue (for example in Singapore) or zhongyue (in Hong Kong). Chinese musicians at a restaurant in Shanghai =Chinese orchestra= There was a tradition of massed instruments in the ritual court music form known as yayue since the Zhou Dynasty. This music may be played by a handful of musicians, or there may be more than 200 for example during the Song Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty there were also large-scale presentations of banquet music called yanyue () in the court. The Tang imperial court may have up to ten different orchestras, each performing a different kind of music. It also had a large outdoor band of nearly 1,400 performers. The modern Chinese orchestra however was created in the 20th century modeled on Western symphony orchestra using Chinese instruments. In the traditional yanyue, a single dominant melodic line was favored, but the new music and arrangements of traditional melodies created for this modern orchestra is more polyphonic in nature. =Instruments and tuning= Many traditional instruments underwent changes in the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western equal temperament is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their traditional voices. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound out of tune and discordant. In order to accommodate Western system, changes were made to the instruments, for example in the pipa the number of frets was increased to 24, based on the 12 tone equal temperament scale, with all the intervals being semitones. There is also a need to standardize the tuning when the instruments are played in an orchestra, which in turn may also affect how the instrument is made. For example, traditionally dizi is made by using a solid piece of bamboo which made it impossible to change the fundamental tuning once the bamboo is cut. This issue was resolved in the 1920s by the insertion of a copper joint to connect two pieces of shorter bamboo, which allows the length of the bamboo to be modified so that minute adjustment to its fundamental pitch can be made. The Xindi, \\"new flute\\", is a 1930s redesign of the Chinese flute incorporating western influences on the basis of equal temperament. In order to achieve a greater vibrancy and loudness with instruments (not to mention longevity), many string instruments are no longer strung with silk but with steel or nylon. For example, metal strings began to be used in place of the traditional silk ones in the 1950s for pipa, resulting in a change in the sound of the pipa which became brighter and stronger.The pipa: How a barbarian lute became a national symbol =Notation= Before the 20th century Chinese used the gongche notation system, in modern times the Jianpu system is common. Western staff notation however is also used. =Performance= In common with the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of traditional Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as qupai, in which tempo and ornamentation vary according to the mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their reaction to what is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto where the same melody at different points in the lover's story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a score in a standard way rather than in the changeable reflective individual way of tradition, this can at times lead to the feeling that a performance has been rushed. Modern popular music = Pop music = Chinese popular music found its beginnings in the shidaiqu genre. The shidaiqu genre was founded by Li Jinhui in mainland China and was influenced by Western jazz artists like Buck Clayton. After the takeover by the Communist in China, popular music were denounced as Yellow Music, a form of pornography. and record companies of Shanghai such as Baak Doi in 1952 left China.Shoesmith, Brian. Rossiter, Ned. [2004] (2004). Refashioning Pop Music in Asia: Cosmopolitan flows, political tempos and aesthetic Industries. Routeledge Publishing. Mainland China was left on the sidelines in the development of pop music for a few decades, as the Chinese pop music industry moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Taiwan. The 1970s saw the rise of cantopop in Hong Kong, and mandopop in its neighboring country Taiwan. In the late 1970s, economic reforms by Deng Xiaoping in mainland China led to the introduction of gangtai culture of Hong Kong and Taiwan, and pop music returned to mainland China. However, for a time the government still have a censorious attitude toward pop music; for example, Hong Kong's icon Anita Mui was banned from returning to the mainland concert stage after performing the song \\"Bad Girl\\" during the 1990s in China as punishment for what the Chinese government called her rebellious attitude.Baranovitch, Nimrod. China's New Voices. University of California press. . Nevertheless, pop music continue to increase in popularity in mainland China, and by 2005, China had overtaken Taiwan in term of the retail value of its music sales. The beginning of the 21st century has seen an increasing number of mainland Chinese artists who produced a wide range of Mandarin pop songs and the release of many new albums. However, despite having a much larger population and increasing consumption of Chinese pop music, China is not yet considered a major production hub of pop music.Keane, Michael. Donald, Stephanie. Hong, Yin. [2002] (2002). Media in China: Consumption, Content and Crisis. Routledge Publishing. Many popular mainland Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese music artists were included in promotions for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. = Hip hop and rap = Mandarin rap music gradually became popular in mainland China, especially in Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing and Sichuan where pop culture is very diverse and modern. Although Chinese perform rap in different dialects and languages, most Chinese hip hop artists perform in China's most popular language: Mandarin. Cantonese rap is also very diverse in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Rock and heavy metal The Peking All- Stars were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979, by foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital. The widely acknowledged forefather of Chinese rock is Cui Jian. In the late 1980s he played the first Chinese rock song called: \\"Nothing To My Name\\" (\\"Yi wu suo you\\"). It was the first time an electric guitar was used in China. He became the most famous performer of the time, and by 1988 he performed at a concert broadcast worldwide in conjunction with the Seoul Summer Olympic Games. His socially critical lyrics earned him the anger of the government and many of his concerts were banned or cancelled. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he played with a red blindfold around his head as an action against the government. Following, two bands became famous Hei Bao (Black Panther) and Tang Dynasty. Both started during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hei Bao is an old-school rock band whose first CD, Hei Bao used the popular English song (\\"Don't Break My Heart\\"). Tang Dynasty was the first Chinese heavy metal band. Its first CD \\"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\\" combines elements of traditional Chinese opera and old school heavy metal. The album was a major breakthrough releasing around 1991/1992. Around 1994‚Äì96: the first thrash metal band, Chao Zai (Overload), was formed. They released three CDs, the last one in cooperation with pop singer Gao Chi of the split-up band The Breathing. At the same time the first nu metal bands were formed and inspired by Western bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park. China would have their own with Yaksa, Twisted Machine, AK-47, Overheal Tank. Black metal is becoming a prominent scene in mainland China, particularly central China. = Punk rock and post-punk = Punk rock first emerged in China in the early 1990s as records from Western punk and post-punk bands were imported into mainland China for the first time. One of the earliest and most renowned punk-influenced Chinese artists was He Yong whose debut album Garbage Dump was released in 1994. Formed in Nanjing in 1997, post-punk group P.K. 14 are regarded as the most important band in the development of Chinese experimental rock music. The band moved to Beijing in 2001 and released their first album 'Upstairs, Turn Left' the same year. P.K. 14's singer-songwriter Yang Haisong (Êù®Êµ∑Â¥ß) has also produced many of the Chinese indie music scene's most celebrated albums (including Carsick Cars' 2007 eponymous debut album), working with independent record labels such as Maybe Mars and Modern Sky. Since the early 2000s, Chinese indie music has grown considerably, with homegrown bands such as Carsick Cars, Birdstriking, Re-TROS, Brain Failure, Demerit, Tookoo, AV Okubo, Hang on the Box and Fanzui Xiangfa all embarking on international tours. Western classical music Whereas orchestras organised by, run solely by and nearly always exclusive to the expatriate community in China are recorded from the early days of the International Settlement in Shanghai (i.e. 1850s) and a Russian orchestra was in operation in Harbin from the early 20th century,, additional text. the beginnings of a unique classical music tradition in China lie with the first foreign trained Chinese conductor, Zheng Zhisheng AKA (romanized) Yin Zizhong. Zheng (Yin or Wan depending on romanization) was raised in China's Guangdong province. He was influenced by the Western Church Music at an early age., additional text. He studied in Lyons and Paris before returning to China in the 1930s. He became the first Chinese conductor of the Chongqing Symphonic Orchestra. additional text. Their performances included compositions from Beethoven and Mozart. The revolutionary spirit of Yin Zizhong's (or romanized Wan-Chi Chung's) style has been continued by the first generation of composers immediately following the accession of the Chinese Communist Party to power, namely Li Delun and Cao Peng. The former provided the driving force and often the life force that kept a tradition alive through the Mao years, especially in his adopted city of Beijing, and the latter has been instrumental in maintaining a high standard of symphonic music, as well as working hard for the popularization of the tradition further into the fabric of Chinese culture, across his long career, which continues to the present. At the same time as this tradition has continued, new generations have sought to bring classical music in China along another path, away from the strict professionalism of the elite trained Li and Cao (who were both at the Russian conservatory in the 1950s) and towards a less nationalistic, but arguably more encompassing attitude towards the tradition. Most influential in this new movement has been the young Shanghai conductor Long Yu.  Patriotic / revolutionary music  During the height of the Cultural Revolution, political music became the dominant form. Music accelerated at the political level into \\"Revolutionary Music\\" leaning toward cult status and becoming mainstream under pro-Communist ideology. Jiang Qing introduced the revolutionary model operas under her direct supervision; the eight Model Dramas (6 operas and 2 ballets) were promoted while traditional operas were banned. Notable examples are the operas The Legend of the Red Lantern and Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy, and the ballet pieces Red Detachment of Women and The White Haired Girl. Other forms of musical composition and performance were greatly restricted. After the Cultural Revolution, musical institutions were reinstated and musical composition and performance revived. Some of the more widely known political songs are Military Anthem of the People's Liberation Army, The East is Red, and the Internationale.

Wilhelm Rust, 1871 are a collection of six instrumental works presented by Bach to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg- Schwedt,MacDonogh, Giles. Frederick the Great: A Life in Deed and Letters. St. Martin's Griffin. New York. 2001. in 1721 (though probably composed earlier). They are widely regarded as some of the best orchestral compositions of the Baroque era.  History  Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt (1710, Antoine Pesne)Bach wrote out the music himself for presentation to the Margrave rather than leaving it to a copyist. While he took the opportunity to revise the music, most likely, it was not freshly composed. He appears to have selected the six pieces from concertos he had composed over a number of years while Kapellmeister at K√∂then, and possibly extending back to his employment at Weimar (1708‚Äì17).Variant versions of the concertos exist, but they are not in Bach's hand and are difficult to date. Bach's dedication to the Margrave was dated 24 March 1721. Translated from the original French, the first sentence of Bach's dedication reads: > As I had the good fortune a few years ago to be heard by Your Royal > Highness, at Your Highness's commands, and as I noticed then that Your > Highness took some pleasure in the little talents which Heaven has given me > for Music, and as in taking Leave of Your Royal Highness, Your Highness > deigned to honour me with the command to send Your Highness some pieces of > my Composition: I have in accordance with Your Highness's most gracious > orders taken the liberty of rendering my most humble duty to Your Royal > Highness with the present Concertos, which I have adapted to several > instruments; begging Your Highness most humbly not to judge their > imperfection with the rigor of that discriminating and sensitive taste, > which everyone knows Him to have for musical works, but rather to take into > benign Consideration the profound respect and the most humble obedience > which I thus attempt to show Him. Bach's reference to his scoring the concertos for \\"several instruments\\" (Concerts avec plusieurs instruments) is an understatement. Bach used the \\"widest spectrum of orchestral instruments ‚Ä¶ in daring combinations,\\" as Christoph Wolff has commented.Christoph Wolff: Johann Sebastian Bach: The Learned Musician (WW Norton, New York, 2000). \\"Every one of the six concertos set a precedent in scoring, and every one was to remain without parallel.\\" Heinrich Besseler has noted that the overall forces required (leaving aside the first concerto, which was rewritten for a special occasion) tallies exactly with the 17 players Bach had at his disposal in K√∂then.Besseler's preface to the Neue Bach-Ausgabe edition of the Brandenburg Concertos is reprinted with a translation in B√§renreiter's Study Score of the Six Brandenburg Concertos (B√§renreiter TP9, 1988)  Content  = No. 1 in F major, BWV 1046 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 1mo √† 2 Corni di Caccia, 3 Hautb: √® Bassono, Violino Piccolo concertato, 2 Violini, una Viola col Basso Continuo. Instrumentation: two corni da caccia (natural horns), three oboes, bassoon, violino piccolo, two violins, viola and basso continuo (harpsichord, cello, viola da gamba and/or violone) Duration: about 22 minutes The Brandenburg Concerto No. 1, BWV 1046.2 (formerly BWV 1046), is the only one in the collection with four movements. The concerto also exists in an alternative version, Sinfonia BWV 1046.1 (formerly BWV 1046a), which appears to have been composed during Bach's years at Weimar. The Sinfonia, which lacks the third movement entirely, and the Polacca (polonaise) from the final movement, appears to have been intended as the opening of the cantata Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd, BWV 208. This implies a date of composition possibly as early as the 1713 premiere of the cantata, although it could have been used for a subsequent revival. The first movement can also be found as the sinfonia of a later cantata Falsche Welt, dir trau ich nicht, BWV 52, but in a version without the piccolo violin that is closer to Sinfonia BWV 1046a. The third movement was used as the opening chorus of the cantata Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden Saiten, BWV 207, where the horns are replaced by trumpets. = No. 2 in F major, BWV 1047 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 2do √† 1 Tromba, 1 Flauto, 1 Hautbois, 1 Violino, concertati, √® 2 Violini, 1 Viola √® Violone in Ripieno col Violoncello √® Basso per il Cembalo. Concertino: natural trumpet in F, recorder, oboe, violin Ripieno: two violins, viola, violone, cello and harpsichord (as basso continuo) Duration: about 13 minutes The trumpet part is still considered one of the most difficult in the entire repertoire, and was originally written for a clarino specialist, almost certainly the court trumpeter in K√∂then, Johann Ludwig Schreiber. After clarino skills were lost in the eighteenth century and before the rise of the historically informed performance movement of the late twentieth century, the part was usually played on the valved trumpet sometimes on a modern F trumpet, a French Horn, or even a Bb Piccolo Trumpet. The clarino does not play in the second movement, as is common practice in baroque era concerti. This is due to its construction, which allows it to play only in major keys. Because concerti often move to a minor key in the second movement, concerti that include the instrument in their first movement and are from the period before the valved trumpet was commonly used usually exclude the trumpet from the second movement. The first movement of this concerto was chosen as the first musical piece to be played on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of Earth's common sounds, languages, and music sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes. The first movement served as a theme for Great Performances in the early-to-mid 1980s, while the third movement served as the theme for William F. Buckley, Jr.'s Firing Line; a revival featuring Margaret Hoover would also use the first movement. Recent research has revealed that this concerto is based on a lost chamber music version for quintet called \\"Concerto da camera in Fa Maggiore\\" (Chamber Concerto in F major): catalogue number is BWV 1047R. It's similar to the orchestra version, in that the Trumpet, Flute, Oboe, & Solo Violin parts are the same, however the orchestra part has been arranged for Basso Continuo (or Piano) by Klaus Hofmann. This reconstructed quintet arrangement is also the very first Piano reduction of the 2'nd Brandenburg Concerto ever heard of & published by Barenreiter Verlag (Product Number BA 5196) = No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 3zo a tre Violini, tre Viole, √® tre Violoncelli col Basso per il Cembalo. Instrumentation: three violins, three violas, three cellos, and harpsichord (as basso continuo) Duration: about 10 minutes The second movement consists of a single measure with the two chords that make up a 'Phrygian half cadence'wikt:Phrygian cadence and‚Äîalthough there is no direct evidence to support it‚Äîit was likely that these chords are meant to surround or follow a cadenza improvised by a harpsichord or violin player. Modern performance approaches range from simply playing the cadence with minimal ornamentation (treating it as a sort of \\"musical semicolon\\"), to inserting movements from other works, to cadenzas varying in length from under a minute to over two minutes. Wendy Carlos's three electronic performances (from Switched-On Bach, Switched-On Brandenburgs, and Switched-On Bach 2000) have second movements that are completely different from each other. Occasionally, the third movement from Bach's Sonata for Violin and Continuo in G, BWV 1021 (marked Largo) is substituted for the second movement as it contains an identical 'Phrygian cadence' as the closing chords. The Largo from the Sonata for Violin and Obbligato Harpsichord in G major, BWV 1019, has also been used. The outer movements use the ritornello form found in many instrumental and vocal works of the time. The first movement can also be found in reworked form as the sinfonia of the cantata Ich liebe den H√∂chsten von ganzem Gem√ºte, BWV 174, with the addition of three oboes and two horns. This concerto is the shortest of the six. = No. 4 in G major, BWV 1049 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 4to √† Violino Principale, due Fiauti d'Echo, due Violini, una Viola √® Violone in Ripieno, Violoncello √® Continuo. Concertino: violin and two recorders (described in the original score as \\"fiauti d'echo\\"). Ripieno: two violins, viola, violone, cello and basso continuo (harpsichord and/or viola da gamba) Duration: about 16 minutes The violin part in this concerto is extremely virtuosic in the first and third movements. In the second movement, the violin provides a bass when the concertino group plays unaccompanied. It has been debated what instrument Bach had in mind for the \\"fiauti d'echo\\" parts. Nowadays these are usually played on alto recorders,The range of both recorder parts in the 4th Brandenburg concerto corresponds to that of the alto recorder although traverse flutes are sometimes used instead: it is also theorized Bach's original intent may have been the flageolet. In some performances, such as those conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the two recorders are positioned offstage, thus giving an \\"echo\\" effect. Bach adapted the 4th Brandenburg concerto as a harpsichord concerto, BWV 1057. = No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 5to √† une Traversiere, une Violino principale, une Violino √® una Viola in ripieno, Violoncello, Violone √® Cembalo concertato. Concertino: harpsichord, violin, flute Ripieno: violin, viola, cello and violone Duration: about 23 minutes The harpsichord is both a concertino and a ripieno instrument. In the concertino passages the part is obbligato; in the ripieno passages it has a figured bass part and plays continuo. This concerto makes use of a popular chamber music ensemble of the time (flute, violin, and harpsichord), which Bach used on its own for the middle movement. It is believed that it was written in 1719, to show off a new harpsichord by Michael Mietke which Bach had brought back from Berlin for the K√∂then court. It is also thought that Bach wrote it for a competition at Dresden with the French composer and organist Louis Marchand; in the central movement, Bach uses one of Marchand's themes. Marchand fled before the competition could take place, apparently scared off in the face of Bach's great reputation for virtuosity and improvisation. The concerto is well suited throughout to showing off the qualities of a fine harpsichord and the virtuosity of its player, but especially in the lengthy solo cadenza to the first movement. It seems almost certain that Bach, considered a great organ and harpsichord virtuoso, was the harpsichord soloist at the premiere. Scholars have seen in this work the origins of the solo keyboard concerto as it is the first example of a concerto with a solo keyboard part.Steinberg, M. The Concerto: A Listener's Guide, p. 14, Oxford (1998) Hutchings, A. 1997. A Companion to Mozart's Piano Concertos, p. 26, Oxford University Press. An earlier version, BWV 1050a, exists, and has many small differences from its later cousin, but no major difference in structure or instrumentation. It is dated ca. 1720‚Äì21. = No. 6 in B major, BWV 1051 = Title on autograph score: Concerto 6to √† due Viole da Braccio, due Viole da Gamba, Violoncello, Violone e Cembalo. Instrumentation: two viole da braccio, two viole da gamba, cello, violone, and harpsichord Duration: about 16 minutes The absence of violins is unusual. Viola da braccio means the normal viola, and is used here to distinguish it from the viola da gamba. When the work was written in 1721, the viola da gamba was already an old-fashioned instrument: the strong supposition that one viola da gamba part was taken by his employer, Prince Leopold, also points to a likely reason for the concerto's composition‚ÄîLeopold wished to join his Kapellmeister playing music. Other theories speculate that, since the viola da braccio was typically played by a lower socioeconomic class (servants, for example), the work sought to upend the musical status quo by giving an important role to a \\"lesser\\" instrument. This is supported by the knowledge that Bach wished to end his tenure under Prince Leopold. By upsetting the balance of the musical roles, he would be released from his servitude as Kapellmeister and allowed to seek employment elsewhere.This explanation is given by Nikolaus Harnoncourt in his interview about the sixth concerto, which features in the 2009 Deutsche Grammophon DVD Johann Sebastian Bach: Brandenburg Concertos. The two violas start the first movement with a vigorous subject in close canon, and as the movement progresses, the other instruments are gradually drawn into the seemingly uninterrupted steady flow of melodic invention which shows the composer's mastery of polyphony. The two violas da gamba are silent in the second movement, leaving the texture of a trio sonata for two violas and continuo, although the cello has a decorated version of the continuo bass line. In the last movement, the spirit of the gigue underlies everything, as it did in the finale of the fifth concerto. Reception Because King Frederick William I of Prussia was not a significant patron of the arts, Christian Ludwig seems to have lacked the musicians in his Berlin ensemble to perform the concertos. The full score was left unused in the Margrave's library until his death in 1734, when it was sold for 24 groschen (as of 2014, about US$24) of silver. The autograph manuscript of the concertos was only rediscovered in the archives of Brandenburg by Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn in 1849; the concertos were first published in the following year.Malcolm Boyd, Bach: The Brandenburg Concertos (Cambridge UP, 1993), . The manuscript was nearly lost in World War II, when being transported for safekeeping to Prussia by train in the care of a librarian. The train came under aerial bombardment, and the librarian escaped from the train to the nearby forest, with the scores hidden under his coat.Eric Siblin, The Cello Suites: In Search of a Baroque Masterpiece, p. 266. Retrieved 9 June 2016 In the modern era these works have been performed by orchestras with the string parts each played by a number of players, under the batons of, for example, Karl Richter and Herbert von Karajan. They have also been performed as chamber music, with one instrument per part, especially by groups using baroque instruments and historically informed techniques and practice. There is also an arrangement for four-hand piano duet by composer Max Reger. A Karl Richter recording was sent into space in 1977 on the Voyager Golden Record. In 2001, the piece came in at number 22 in the Classic 100 Original (ABC) listing. In 2007, all six of the concertos appeared on the Classic 100 Concerto (ABC) listing.

It is best known for its role in the War of 1812, when it successfully defended Baltimore Harbor from an attack by the British navy from the Chesapeake Bay on September 13‚Äì14, 1814. It was first built in 1798 and was used continuously by the U.S. armed forces through World War I and by the Coast Guard in World War II. It was designated a national park in 1925, and in 1939 was redesignated a \\"National Monument and Historic Shrine\\". During the War of 1812 an American storm flag, , was flown over Fort McHenry during the bombardment. It was replaced early on the morning of September 14, 1814 with a larger American garrison flag, . The larger flag signaled American victory over the British in the Battle of Baltimore. The sight of the ensign inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\" that was later set to the tune \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" and became known as \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", the national anthem of the United States. History =18th Century= Fort McHenry was built on the site of the former Fort Whetstone, which had defended Baltimore from 1776 to 1797. Fort Whetstone stood on Whetstone Point (today's residential and industrial area of Locust Point) peninsula, which juts into the opening of Baltimore Harbor between the Basin (today's Inner Harbor) and Northwest branch on the north side and the Middle and Ferry (now Southern) branches of the Patapsco River on the south side. The Frenchman Jean Foncin designed the fort in 1798, and it was built between 1798 and 1800. The new fort's purpose was to improve the defenses of the increasingly important Port of Baltimore from future enemy attacks. The new fort was a bastioned pentagon, surrounded by a dry moat‚Äîa deep, broad trench. The moat would serve as a shelter from which infantry might defend the fort from a land attack. In case of such an attack on this first line of defense, each point, or bastion could provide a crossfire of cannon and small arms fire. Fort McHenry was named after early American statesman James McHenry (1753‚Äì1816), a Scots-Irish immigrant and surgeon-soldier. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress from Maryland and a signer of the United States Constitution. Afterwards, he was appointed United States Secretary of War (1796‚Äì1800), serving under Presidents George Washington and John Adams. =19th Century= War of 1812 Bombardment of Fort McHenry Beginning at 6:00 a.m. on September 13, 1814, British warships under the command of Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane continuously bombarded Fort McHenry for 25 hours. The American defenders had 18-, 24- and 32-pounder () cannons. The British guns had a range of , and the British rockets had a range, but neither guns nor rockets were accurate. The British ships were unable to pass Fort McHenry and penetrate Baltimore Harbor because of its defenses, including a chain of 22 sunken ships, and the American cannons. The British vessels were only able to fire their rockets and mortars at the fort at the weapons' maximum range. The poor accuracy on both sides resulted in very little damage to either side before the British, having depleted their ammunition, ceased their attack on the morning of September 14. Thus the naval part of the British invasion of Baltimore had been repulsed. Only one British warship, a bomb vessel, received a direct hit from the fort's return fire, which wounded one crewman. The Americans, under the command of Major George Armistead, lost four killed‚Äîincluding one Black soldier, Private William Williams, and a woman who was cut in half by a bomb as she carried supplies to the troops‚Äîand 24 wounded. At one point during the bombardment, a bomb crashed through the fort's powder magazine. However, either the rain extinguished the fuse or the bomb was a dud. Star Spangled Banner Flag that flew over Fort McHenry during its bombardment in 1814, which was witnessed by Francis Scott Key. The family of Major Armistead, the commander of the fort, kept the flag until they donated it to the Smithsonian in 1912. Francis Scott Key, a Washington lawyer who had come to Baltimore to negotiate the release of Dr. William Beanes, a civilian prisoner of war, witnessed the bombardment from a nearby truce ship. An oversized American flag had been sewn by Mary Pickersgill for $405.90 in anticipation of the British attack on the fort. When Key saw the flag emerge intact in the dawn of September 14, he was so moved that he began that morning to compose \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\" set to the tune \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" which would later be renamed \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\" and become the United States' national anthem. Civil War During the American Civil War the area where Fort McHenry sits served as a military prison, confining both Confederate soldiers, as well as a large number of Maryland political figures who were suspected of being Confederate sympathizers. The imprisoned included newly elected Baltimore Mayor George William Brown, the city council, and the new police commissioner, George P. Kane, and members of the Maryland General Assembly along with several newspaper editors and owners. Francis Scott Key's grandson, Francis Key Howard, was one of these political detainees. Some of the cells used still exist and can be visited at the fort. Fort McHenry also served to train artillery at this time; this service is the origin of the Rodman guns presently located and displayed at the fort. On 25 May 1861 John Merryman was arrested in Baltimore County and imprisoned in Fort McHenry. Merryman had had a role in destroying bridges in Maryland to impede the movement of Union troops. Merryman petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney for a writ of habeas corpus, and Taney granted the petition, demanding that Merryman appear in his courtroom the next day and sending U.S. Marshals to the fort to enforce the ruling. A famous and dramatic standoff then occurred at the gates of the fort between the Federal Marshals and General George Cadwalader, the commander of Union troops of the Fort. The commander refused to comply with the order on the grounds that he was acting under orders from President Abraham Lincoln, who had suspended habeas corpus. The court case, Ex parte Merryman, remains unresolved, and the Executive Branch continued to refuse to comply with Taney's ruling. =20th Century= World War I During World War I, an additional hundred-odd buildings were built on the land surrounding the fort in order to convert the entire facility into an enormous U.S. Army hospital for the treatment of troops returning from the European conflict. None of those buildings remain, while the original fort has been preserved and restored to essentially its condition during the War of 1812. World War II During World War II, Fort McHenry served as a Coast Guard base. Used for training, the historic sections remained open to the public. National monument A replica of the 15-star/15-stripe U.S. flag that currently flies over Fort McHenry The fort was made a national park in 1925; on August 11, 1939, it was redesignated a \\"National Monument and Historic Shrine\\", the only such doubly designated place in the United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It has become national tradition that when a new flag is designed it first flies over Fort McHenry. The first official 49- and 50-star American flags were flown over the fort and are still located on the premises. =Today= The fort has become a center of recreation for the Baltimore locals as well as a prominent tourist destination. Thousands of visitors come each year to see the \\"Birthplace of the Star Spangled Banner.\\" It's easily accessible by water taxi from the popular Baltimore Inner Harbor. However, to prevent abuse of the parking lots at the Fort, the National Park Service does not permit passengers to take the water taxi back to the Inner Harbor unless they have previously used it to arrive at the monument. Several authorized archaeological digs have been conducted, and found artifacts are on display in one of the buildings surrounding the Parade Ground. These structures, as well as the Visitor Center, have numerous other exhibits as well that show the fort's use over time. Every September, the City of Baltimore commemorates Defenders Day in honor of the Battle of Baltimore. It is the biggest celebration of the year at the Fort, accompanied by a weekend of programs, events, and fireworks. In 2005 the living history volunteer unit, the Fort McHenry Guard, was awarded the George B. Hartzog award for serving the National Park Service as the best volunteer unit. Among the members of the unit is Martin O'Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and Governor of Maryland, who was made the unit's honorary colonel in 2003. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry, the Star Spangled Banner Flag, has deteriorated to an extremely fragile condition. After undergoing restoration at the National Museum of American History, it is now on display there in a special exhibit that allows it to lie at a slight angle in dim light. (color image of flag as it appears after preservation work) The United States Code currently authorizes Fort McHenry's closure to the public in the event of a national emergency for use by the military for the duration of such an emergency. In 2013, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program. On September 10‚Äì16, 2014, Fort McHenry celebrated the bicentennial of the writing of the Star Spangled Banner called the Star Spangled Spectacular. The event included a parade of tall ships, a large fireworks show, and the Navy's Blue Angels , restoration efforts began to preserve the original brick used in construction of the Fort, primarily through mortar replacement. On May 25th, 2020, President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attended and spoke at a ceremony at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. The city's mayor, Jack Young, had asked Mr. Trump not to come, saying in a statement, \\"That President Trump is deciding to pursue non- essential travel sends the wrong message to our residents, many of whom have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus.\\" He went on to say that the president's trip would require expensive personnel and equipment that would burden the city, which Young said has been losing $20 million each month during the pandemic. Mr. Trump spoke at the Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine. During remarks at the Memorial Day ceremony, Mr. Trump honored \\"the immortal souls who fought and died to keep us free.\\" \\"Every time we sing our anthem ‚Äî every time its rousing chorus swells our hearts with pride ‚Äî we renew the eternal bonds of loyalty to our fallen heroes,\\" the president said. \\"We think of the soldiers who spent their final heroic moments on distant battlefields to keep us safe at home. We remember the young Americans who never got the chance to grow old but whose legacy will outlive us all.\\" Mr. Trump also noted the impact the coronavirus has had on troops and members of the National Guard who have been assisting with the response. \\"Tens of thousands of service members and national guardsmen are on the frontlines of our war against this terrible virus, caring for patients, delivering critical supplies and working night and day to safeguard our citizens,\\" he said. \\"As one nation, we mourn alongside all of the families who have lost a loved one ‚Äì including the families of our great veterans.\\" On August 26, 2020, when due to the Coronacrisis a normal Republican National Convention could not be held, vice president Mike Pence held his acceptance speech after being nominated for a second term as vice president of the United States at Fort McHenry.

E. Neuendorf, Glossary of Geology, p. 723) is a rock that has been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals. These geomorphic features are most typically found in arid environments where there is little vegetation to interfere with aeolian particle transport, where there are frequently strong winds, and where there is a steady but not overwhelming supply of sand. Wind-carved \\"mushroom\\" rocks are the centerpiece of White Desert national park, Egypt Ventifacts can be abraded to eye-catching natural sculptures such as the main features of the White Desert near Farafra oasis in Egypt. In moderately tall, isolated rock outcrops, mushroom shaped pillars of rock may form as the outcrop is eroded by saltating sand grains. This occurs because, even in strong winds, sand grains can't be continuously held in the air. Instead, the particles bounce along the ground, rarely reaching higher than a few feet above the earth. Over time, the bouncing sand grains can erode the lower portions of a ventifact, while leaving a larger less eroded cap. The resulting forms thus frequently resemble fantastical stone mushrooms. Individual stones, such as those forming desert pavement, are often found with grooved, etched, or polished surfaces where these same wind-driven processes have slowly worn away the rock. Stones with a small number of wind facets have names reflecting this number, e.g. a dreikanter is a roughly pyramidal stone having 3 wind facets (and one buried, rounded side). When ancient ventifacts are preserved without being moved or disturbed, they may serve as a paleo-wind indicators. The wind direction at the time the ventifact formed will be parallel to grooves or striations cut in the rock. Ventifacts have also been discovered on Mars, where such sharp immobile rocks have caused significant damage to the wheels of the Curiosity rover.NASA, Premature Wear of the MSL Wheels, 2017-09-26 An example of a Martian ventifact was named Jake Matijevic.

Russia is a large and culturally diverse country, with many ethnic groups, each with their own locally developed music. Russian music also includes significant contributions from ethnic minorities, who populated the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia. Russian music went through a long history, beginning from ritual folk songs and the sacred music of the Russian Orthodox Church. The 19th century saw the rise of highly acclaimed Russian classical music, and in the 20th century major contributions by various composers such as Igor Stravinsky as well as Soviet composers, while the modern styles of Russian popular music developed, including Russian rock, Russian hip hop and Russian pop. History =Early history= Medieval Gusli players (painting by Victor Vasnetsov) Written documents exist that describe the musical culture of the Rus'. The most popular kind of instruments in medieval Russia were thought to have been string instruments, such as the gusli or gudok. Archeologists have uncovered examples of these instruments in the Novgorod region dating as early as 11th century. (Novgorod republic had deep traditions in music; its most popular folk hero and the chief character of several epics was Sadko, a gusli player). Other instruments in common use include flutes (svirel), and percussive instruments such as the treshchotka and the buben. The most popular form of music, however was singing. Bylinas (epic ballads) about folk heroes such as Sadko, Ilya Muromets, and others were often sung, sometimes to instrumental accompaniment. The texts of some of these epics have been recorded. In the period of Muscovy, two major genres formed Russian music: the sacred music of the Orthodox Church and secular music used for entertainment. The sacred music draws its tradition from the Byzantine Empire, with key elements being used in Russian Orthodox bell ringing, as well as choral singing. Neumes were developed for musical notation, and as a result several examples of medieval sacred music have survived to this day, among them two stichera composed by Tsar Ivan IVMarina Ritzarev. Eighteenth-century Russian music. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. , in the 16th century. Secular music included the use of musical instruments such as fipple flutes and string instruments, and was usually played on holidays initially by skomorokhs ‚Äì jesters and minstrels who entertained the nobility. During the reactionary period of the Great Russian Schism in the 17th century, skomorokhs along with their form of secular music were banned from plying their trade numerous times, their instruments were burned and those who disagree with Alexis of Russia's 1648 law \\"About the correction of morals and the destruction of superstitions\\" (–û–± –∏—Å–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤–æ–≤ –∏ —É–Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Å—É–µ–≤–µ—Ä–∏–π) were punished physically first and then were to be deported to Malorossia (modern Ukraine), but despite these restrictions, some of their traditions survived to the present day. =18th and 19th century: Russian classical music= Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, a famous Classical Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a prominent Russian composer of the 19th century (portrait by Valentin Serov) Russia was a late starter in developing a native tradition of classical music due to the proscription by the Orthodox Church against secular music.Holden, xxi; Maes, 14. Beginning in the reign of Ivan IV, the Imperial Court invited Western composers and musicians to fill this void. By the time of Peter I, these artists were a regular fixture at Court.Frolova-Walker, New Grove (2001), 21:925 While not personally inclined toward music, Peter saw European music as a mark of civilization and a way of Westernizing the country; his establishment of the Western-style city of Saint Petersburg helped foster its spread to the rest of the upper classes.Maes, 14. A craze for Italian opera at Court during the reigns of Empresses Elisabeth and Catherine also helped spread interest in Western music among the aristocracy.Bergamini, 175; Kovnatskaya, New Grove (2001), 22:116; Maes, 14. This craze became so pervasive that many were not even aware that Russian composers existed.Campbell, New Grove (2001), 10:3, Maes, 30. The focus on European music meant that Russian composers had to write in Western style if they wanted their compositions to be performed. Their success at this was variable due to a lack of familiarity with European rules of composition. Some composers were able to travel abroad for training, usually to Italy, and learned to compose vocal and instrumental works in the Italian Classical tradition popular in the day. These include ethnic Ukrainian composers Dmitri Bortniansky, Maksim Berezovsky and Artem Vedel.Maes, 16. The first great Russian composer to exploit native Russian music traditions into the realm of secular music was Mikhail Glinka (1804‚Äì1857), who composed the early Russian language operas Ivan Susanin and Ruslan and Lyudmila. They were neither the first operas in the Russian language nor the first by a Russian, but they gained fame for relying on distinctively Russian tunes and themes and being in the vernacular. Russian folk music became the primary source for the younger generation composers. A group that called itself \\"The Mighty Five\\", headed by Balakirev (1837‚Äì1910) and including Rimsky-Korsakov (1844‚Äì1908), Mussorgsky (1839‚Äì81), Borodin (1833‚Äì87) and C√©sar Cui (1835‚Äì1918), proclaimed its purpose to compose and popularize Russian national traditions in classical music. Among the Mighty Five's most notable compositions were the operas The Snow Maiden (Snegurochka), Sadko, Boris Godunov, Prince Igor, Khovanshchina, and symphonic suite Scheherazade. Many of the works by Glinka and the Mighty Five were based on Russian history, folk tales and literature, and are regarded as masterpieces of romantic nationalism in music. This period also saw the foundation of the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859, led by composer- pianists Anton (1829‚Äì94) and Nikolay Rubinstein (1835‚Äì81). The Mighty Five was often presented as the Russian Music Society's rival, with the Five embracing their Russian national identity and the RMS being musically more conservative. However the RMS founded Russia's first Conservatories in St Petersburg and in Moscow: the former trained the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840‚Äì93), best known for ballets like Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker. He remains Russia's best-known composer outside Russia. Easily the most famous successor in his style is Sergey Rakhmaninov (1873‚Äì1943), who studied at the Moscow Conservatory (where Tchaikovsky himself taught). The late 19th and early 20th century saw the third wave of Russian classics: Igor Stravinsky (1882‚Äì1971), Alexander Scriabin (1872‚Äì1915), Sergei Prokofiev (1891‚Äì1953) and Dmitri Shostakovich (1906‚Äì1975). They were experimental in style and musical language. Stravinsky was particularly influential on his contemporaries and subsequent generations of composers, both in Russia and across Europe and the United States. Stravinsky permanently emigrated after the Russian revolution. Although Prokofiev also left Russia in 1918, he eventually returned and contributed to Soviet music. In the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the so-called \\"romance songs\\" became very popular. The greatest and most popular singers of the \\"romances\\" usually sang in operas at the same time. The most popular was Fyodor Shalyapin. Singers usually composed music and wrote the lyrics, as did Alexander Vertinsky, Konstantin Sokolsky, and Pyotr Leshchenko. =20th century: Soviet music= The Orchestra of Valentin Sporius, 1937, Kuybyshev After the Russian Revolution, Russian music changed dramatically. The early 1920s were the era of avant-garde experiments, inspired by the \\"revolutionary spirit\\" of the era. New trends in music (like music based on synthetic chords) were proposed by enthusiastic clubs such as Association for Contemporary Music.Amy Nelson. Music for the Revolution: Musicians and Power in Early Soviet Russia. Penn State University Press, 2004. 346 pages. Arseny Avraamov pioneered the graphical sound, and Leon Theremin invented thereminvox, one of the early electronic instruments. However, in the 1930s, under the regime of Joseph Stalin, music was forced to be contained within certain boundaries of content and innovation. Classicism was favoured, and experimentation discouraged.Soviet Music and Society under Lenin and Stalin: The Baton and Sickle. Edited by Neil Edmunds. Routledge, 2009. Pages: 264. (A notable example: Shostakovich's veristic opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District was denounced in Pravda newspaper as \\"formalism\\" and soon removed from theatres for years). The musical patriarchs of the era were Prokofiev, Shostakovich, Aram Khachaturian and Alexander Alexandrov. The latter is best known for composing the Anthem of the Soviet Union and the song \\"The Sacred War\\". With time, a wave of younger Soviet composers, such as Georgy Sviridov, Alfred Schnittke, and Sofia Gubaidulina took the forefront due to the rigorous Soviet education system. The Union of Soviet Composers was established in 1932 and became the major regulatory body for Soviet music. Jazz was introduced to Soviet audiences by Valentin Parnakh in the 1920s. Singer Leonid Uteosov and film score composer Isaak Dunayevsky helped its popularity, especially with the popular comedy movie Jolly Fellows, which featured a jazz soundtrack. Eddie Rosner, Oleg Lundstrem and others contributed to Soviet jazz music. Alla Pugachova, Soviet 1970-80s pop star Film soundtracks produced a significant part of popular Soviet/Russian songs of the time, as well as of orchestral and experimental music. The 1930s saw Prokofiev's scores for Sergei Eisenstein's epic movies, and also soundtracks by Isaak Dunayevsky that ranged from classical pieces to popular jazz. Notable film composers from the late Soviet era included Vladimir Dashkevich, Tikhon Khrennikov, Alexander Zatsepin, and Gennady Gladkov, among others. Among the notable people of Soviet electronic music were Vyacheslav Mescherin, creator of Electronic Instruments Orchestra, and ambient composer Eduard Artemiev, best known for his scores for Tarkovsky's science fiction films. The 1960s and 1970s saw the beginning of modern Russian pop and rock music. It started with the wave of VIAs (vocal-instrumental ensembles), a specific sort of music bands performing radio-friendly pop, rock and folk, composed by members of the Union of Composers and approved by censorship. This wave begun with Pojuschie Gitary and Pesnyary; popular VIA bands also included Tcvety, Zemlyane and Verasy. That period of music also saw individual pop stars such as Iosif Kobzon, Sofia Rotaru, Alla Pugacheva, Valery Leontiev, Yuri Antonov. Many of them remain popular to this day. They were the mainstream of Soviet music media, headliners of festivals such as Song of the Year, Sopot, and Golden Orpheus. The year 1977 saw also establishment of Moskovsky Komsomolets hit parade, the Russia's first music chart. Kino, an iconic Soviet post-punk band Music publishing and promotion in the Soviet Union was a state monopoly. To earn money and fame from their talent, Soviet musicians had to assign to the state-owned label Melodiya. This meant accepting certain boundaries of experimentation, that is, the family-friendly performance and politically neutral lyrics favoured by censors. Meanwhile, with the arrival of new sound recording technologies, it became possible for common fans to record and exchange their music via magnetic tape recorders. This helped underground music subculture (such as bard and rock music) to flourish despite being ignored by the state-owned media. \\"Bardic\\" or \\"authors' song\\" (–∞–≤—Ç–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è) is an umbrella term for the singer-songwriter movement that arose at the early 1960s. It can be compared to the American folk revival movement of the 60s, with their simple single-guitar arrangements and poetical lyrics. Initially ignored by the state media, bards like Vladimir Vysotsky, Bulat Okudzhava, Alexander Galich gained so much popularity that they finished being distributed by the state owned Melodiya record company. The largest festival of bard music is Grushinsky festival, held annually since 1968. Rock music came to the Soviet Union in the late 1960s with Beatlemania, and many rock bands arose during the late 1970s, such as Mashina Vremeni, Aquarium, and Autograph. Unlike the VIAs, these bands were not allowed to publish their music, and remained underground. The \\"golden age\\" of Russian rock is widely considered to have been the 1980s. Censorship was mitigated, rock clubs opened in Leningrad and Moscow, and soon rock became mainstream.Walter Gerald Moss. A History Of Russia: Since 1855, Volume 2. Anthem Series on Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies. Anthem Press, 2004. 643 pages. Popular bands of that time include Kino, Alisa, Aria, DDT, Nautilus Pompilius, and Grazhdanskaya Oborona. New wave and post-punk were the trend in 80s Russian rock. =21st century: modern Russian music= Aria, Russia's most prominent heavy metal band t.A.T.u., a Russian pop group that broke through to Western charts Oxxxymiron, a popular Russian 2010s rapper Russian pop music is well developed, and enjoys mainstream success via pop music media such as MTV Russia, Muz TV and various radio stations. Right after the fall of the Iron Wall, artists, like Christian Ray, took an active political stance, supporting the first president Boris Yeltsin. A number of pop artists have broken through in recent years. The Russian duet t.A.T.u. is the most successful Russian pop band of its time. They have reached number one in many countries around the world with several of their singles and albums. Other popular artists include the Eurovision 2008 winner Dima Bilan, as well as Valery Meladze, Grigory Leps,VIA Gra, Nyusha, Vintage, Philipp Kirkorov, Vitas and Alsou. Music producers like Igor Krutoy, Maxim Fadeev, Ivan Shapovalov, Igor Matvienko, and Konstantin Meladze control a major share of Russia's pop music market, in some ways continuing the Soviet style of artist management. On the other side, some independent acts such as Neoclubber use new-era promo tools to avoid these old-fashioned Soviet ways of reaching their fans. Russian girl trio Serebro are one of the most popular Russian acts to dominate charts outside of the European market. The group's most known single \\"Mama Lover\\" placed in the US Billboard Charts, becoming the first Russian act to chart since t.A.T.u.'s single \\"All the Things She Said\\". Russian production companies, such as Hollywood World, have collaborated with western music stars, creating a new, more globalized space for music. The rock music scene has gradually evolved from the united movement into several different subgenres similar to those found in the West. There are youth pop rock and alternative rock (Mumiy Troll, Zemfira, Splean, Bi-2, Zveri). There are also punk rock, ska and grunge (Korol i Shut, Pilot, Leningrad, Distemper, Elisium). The heavy metal scene has grown substantially, with new bands playing power and progressive metal (Catharsis, Epidemia, Shadow Host, Mechanical Poet), and pagan metal (Arkona, Butterfly Temple, Temnozor).Diverse Genres of Modern Music in Russia ‚Äì Russia- Channel.com Rock music media has become prevalent in modern Russia. The most notable is Nashe Radio, which promotes classic rock and pop punk.

Others include A-One TV channel, specializing in alternative music and hardcore. It has promoted bands like Amatory, Tracktor Bowling and Slot, and has awarded many of them with its Russian Alternative Music Prize.Russian alternative rock RAMPed up Radio Maximum broadcasts both Russian and western modern pop and rock. Other types of music include folk rock (Melnitsa), trip hop (Linda) and reggae (Jah Division). Hip hop/rap is represented by Bad Balance, Kasta, Ligalize and Mnogotochie. An experimental rapcore scene is headlined by Dolphin and Kirpichi. A specific, exclusively Russian kind of music has emerged, which mixes criminal songs, bard and romance music. It is labelled \\"Russian chanson\\" (a neologism popularized by its main promoter, Radio Chanson). Its main artists include Mikhail Krug, Mikhail Shufutinsky, and Alexander Rosenbaum. With lyrics about daily life and society, and frequent romanticisation of the criminal underworld, chanson is especially popular among adult males of the lower social class.Modern Russian History in the Mirror of Criminal Song ‚Äì An academic articleNotes From a Russian Musical Underground ‚Äì A New York Times article about modern Russian Chanson Electronic music in modern Russia is underdeveloped in comparison to other genres. This is mostly due to a lack of promotion. There are some independent underground acts performing IDM, downtempo, house, trance and dark psytrance (including tracker music scene), and broadcasting their work via internet radio. They include Parasense, Fungus Funk, Kindzadza, Lesnikov-16, Yolochnye Igrushki, Messer F√ºr Frau M√ºller and Zedd (Russian-German artist). Of the few artists that have broken through to the mainstream media, there are PPK and DJ Groove, that exploit Soviet movie soundtracks for their dance remixes. In the 2000s the Darkwave and Industrial scene, closely related to Goth subculture, has become prevalent, with such artists as Dvar, Otto Dix, Stillife, Theodor Bastard, Roman Rain, Shmeli and Biopsychoz. Hardbass, an offshoot of UK Hard House originating in Russia in the late 1990s, has spread internationally via the internet, with acts such as DJ Blyatman, Hard Bass School, & XS Project amassing significant followings. The profile of classical or concert hall music has to a considerable degree been eclipsed by on one hand the rise of commercial popular music in Russia, and on the other its own lack of promotion since the collapse of the USSR.See Richard Taruskin \\"Where is Russia's New Music?\\", reprinted in On Russian Music. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009: p. 381 Yet a number of composers born in the 1950s and later have made some impact, notably Leonid Desyatnikov, who became the first composer in decades to have a new opera commissioned by the Bolshoi Theatre (The Children of Rosenthal, 2005), and whose music has been championed by Gidon Kremer and Roman Mints. Meanwhile, Gubaidulina, amongst several former-Soviet composers of her generation, continues to maintain a high profile outside Russia composing several prestigious and well-received works including \\"In tempus praesens\\" (2007) for the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The early 2000s saw a boom of musicals in Russia. Notre-Dame de Paris, Nord-Ost, Rom√©o et Juliette, and We Will Rock You were constantly performed in Moscow theatres at the time. The popularity of musicals was hampered by the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and was only revived at the end of the decade. 2010s saw the rise of popularity of Russian hip hop, especially rap battles on the internet by artists like Oxxxymiron and Gnoyny, among others. Ethnic roots music Russia today is a multi-ethnic state with over 300 ethnicities living under one flag. Each of these ethnic groups has their own indigenous folk, sacred and in some cases art music, which can loosely be categorized together under the guise of ethnic roots music, or folk music. This category can further be broken down into folkloric (modern adaptations of folk material, and authentic presentations of ethnic music). =Adygea= In recent years, Adygea has seen the formation of a number of new musical institutions. These include two orchestras, one of which (Russkaya Udal) uses folk instruments, and a chamber music theater. Adygea's national anthem was written by Iskhak Shumafovich Mashbash with music by Umar Khatsitsovich Tkhabisimov. =Altay= Altay is a Central Asian region, known for traditional epics and a number of folk instruments. =Bashkir= The first major study of Bashkir music appeared in 1897, when ethnographer Rybakov S.G. wrote Music and Songs of the Ural's Muslims and Studies of Their Way of Life. Later, Lebedinskiy L.N. collected numerous folk songs in Bashkortostan beginning in 1930. The 1968 foundation of the Ufa State Institute of Arts sponsored research in the field. The kurai is the most important instrument in the Bashkir ensemble. =Buryatia= The Buryats of the far east is known for distinctive folk music which uses the two-stringed horsehead fiddle, or morin khuur. The style has no polyphony and has little melodic innovation. Narrative structures are very common, many of them long epics which claim to be the last song of a famous hero, such as in the \\"Last Song of Rinchin Dorzhin\\". Modern Buryat musicians include the band Uragsha, which uniquely combines Siberian and Russian language lyrics with rock and Buryat folk songs, and Namgar, who is firmly rooted in the folk tradition but also explores connections to other musical cultures. =Chechnya= Alongside the Chechen rebellion of the 1990s came a resurgence in Chechen national identity, of which music is a major part. People like Said Khachukayev became prominent promoting Chechen music. The Chechen national anthem is said to be \\"Death or Freedom\\", an ancient song of uncertain origin. =Dagestan= Dagestan's most famous composer may be Gotfrid Hasanov, who is said to be the first professional composer from Dagestan. He wrote the first Dagestani opera, Khochbar, in 1945 and recorded a great deal of folk music from all the peoples of Dagestan. =Karelia= Karelians are Finnish, and so much of their music is the same as Finnish music. The Kalevala is a very important part of traditional music; it is a recitation of Finnish legends, and is considered an integral part of the Finnish folk identity. The Karelian Folk Music Ensemble is a prominent folk group. =Ossetia= Ossetians are people of the Caucasian Region, and thus Ossetian music and dance have similar themes to the music of Chechnya and the music of Dagestan. =Russia= Carnival in Petrograd in about 1919 Archeology and direct evidence show a variety of musical instruments in ancient Russia. Authentic folk instruments include the Livenka (accordion) and woodwinds like zhaleika, svirel and kugikli, as well as numerous percussion instruments: buben, bubenci, kokshnik, korobochka, lozhki, rubel, treschetka, vertushka and zvonchalka. Chastushkas are a kind of Russian folk song with a long history. They are typically rapped, and are humorous or satiric. During the 19th century, Count Uvarov led a campaign of nationalist revival which initiated the first professional orchestra with traditional instruments, beginning with Vasily Andreyev, who used the balalaika in an orchestra late in the century. Just after the dawn of the 20th century, Mitrofan Pyatnitsky founded the Pyatnitsky Choir, which used rural peasant singers and traditional sounds. =Sakha= Shamanism remains an important cultural practice of the ethnic groups of Siberia and Sakhalin, where several dozen groups live. The Yakuts are the largest, and are known for their olonkho songs and the khomus, a jaw harp. =Tatarstan= Tatar folk music has rhythmic peculiarities and pentatonic intonation in common with nations of the Volga area, who are ethnically Finno-Ugric and Turkic. Singing girls, renowned for their subtlety and grace, are a prominent component of Tatar folk music. Instruments include the kubyz (violin), quray (flute) and talianka (accordion). =Tuva= Tuvan throat singing, or xoomii, is famous worldwide, primarily for its novelty. The style is highly unusual and foreign to most listeners, who typically find it inaccessible and amelodic. In throat singing, the natural harmonic resonances of the lips and mouth are tuned to select certain overtones. The style was first recorded by Ted Levin, who helped catalogue a number of different styles. These include borbannadir (which is compared to the sound of a flowing river), sygyt (similar to whistling), xoomii, chylandyk (likened to chirping crickets) and ezengileer (like a horse's trotting). Of particular international fame are the group Huun-Huur-Tu and master throat singer Kongar-ool Ondar. =Ukrainian music in Russia= Although Ukraine is an independent country since 1991, Ukrainians constitute the second-largest ethnic minority in Russia. The bandura is the most important and distinctive instrument of the Ukrainian folk tradition, and was used by court musicians in the various Tsarist courts. The kobzars, a kind of wandering performers who composed dumy, or folk epics. Many of the early classical composers of Russia such as Dmitry Bortniansky, Maksym Berezovsky, Artemy Vedel, and a significant number of others, were of Ukrainian descent. =Hardbass in Russia= Hardbass or hard bass (Russian: —Ö–∞—Ä–¥–±–∞—Å—Å, tr. hardbass, IPA: [x…êrdÀàbas]) is a subgenre of electronic music which originated from Russia during the late 1990s, drawing inspiration from UK hard house, bouncy techno and hardstyle. Hardbass is characterized by its fast tempo (usually 150‚Äì175 BPM), donks, distinctive basslines (commonly known as \\"hard bounce\\"), distorted sounds, heavy kicks and occasional rapping. Hardbass has become a central stereotype of the gopnik subculture. In several European countries, so-called \\"hardbass scenes\\" have sprung up,[1] which are events related to the genre that involve multiple people dancing in public while masked, sometimes with moshing involved. From 2015 onward, hardbass has also appeared as an Internet meme, depicting Slavic and Russian subcultures with the premiere of the video \\"Cheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem\\", based on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series of games from GSC game world.[2] See also *List of Russian composers *Russian traditional music References =Notes= = Bibliography = * Bergamini, John, The Tragic Dynasty: A History of the Romanovs (New York: G.P.

He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as Speaker of the English House of Commons during the Parliament of 1484, in which he sat as knight of the shire for Northamptonshire. He also received a substantial grant of land from the king, enough to make him richer than most knights.Ross, p. 156. In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, tacked up a lampooning poem to St. Paul's Cathedral, which mentions Catesby among the three aides to King Richard, whose emblem was a white boar: (The dog here refers to Lovell's heraldic symbol, a wolf.)Robert Fabyan, The New Chronicles of England and France in to Parts (London, 1811), p. 672.Fields, Bertram.

Whilst there are traces of pre-historic musical instruments, the country has a rich heritage of folk music and mediaeval liturgical music, and from the 18th century onwards, in particular, musical life was influenced by that of Austria-Hungary. In the 19th century, composers such as J√°n Levoslav Bella began to write romantic music with a Slovak character. In the twentieth century, there were a number of composers who identified with Slovak culture. After the fall of communism in 1989‚Äì90 the country also began to develop its own popular music scene in Western style. History of music in Slovakia The term Slovak music is slightly confusing; many peoples lived over the ages in the territory now represented by the state of Slovakia, and the history of the region's music is therefore not merely the history of the music of the Slovaks Ejlucka, Luckasiroka, traditional Slovak song. =Earliest times= Bone pipes dating from the Early Bronze Age (about 3000 BC) have been found in the Nitra region, testifying to the early role of music in the Celtic 'Nitra Culture'. Such instruments were produced continuously, albeit with more sophistication, up to the mediaeval period. Other early instruments found include drums dating back to the Palaeolithic period, iron and bronze bells from the 3rd or 4th century AD. Other folk instruments of the region whose early development must remain largely conjectural include the fujara and the Slovak versions of bagpipes and the jaw harp. They certainly existed in the 15th century. =The medieval period= From the medieval period onwards writers identify a number of principal streams of music in Slovakia. The principal classifications include church music, folk music, and instrumental music heard in towns and courts. Each of these has of course numerous subsidiary classifications. Some of the oldest recorded forms of music in Slovakia are liturgical song (in Old Slavonic) from the time of Great Moravian empire (9th century), from which developed much of the sacred music of later centuries. Latin plainsong was also widespread in the region at this early period, especially after the incororation of Slovakia into the Kingdom of Hungary in 1218. Early codices include the 'Nitra Gospels' of c. 1100, and the 'Pray codex' (c. 1195). From the 15th to the 17th centuries, polyphony was practised and developed at many urban centres, including Bratislava, Bardejov, Levoƒça and Ke≈æmarok.OMOL, Slovakia In 1526 when Slovakia became part of the empire of the Habsburgs, Bratislava became a coronation city, and this was to greatly influence the development of formal music in the country's towns. In the countryside, folk music developed in a more insular manner in the country's various regions. =Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries= As elsewhere in Europe, the Church and the aristocracy became the main patrons of formal music during this period. Church composers were active throughout the country; e.g., in the polyphonic tradition, Andreas Neoman who worked at Bardejov and elsewhere in the early 17th century, J√°n ≈†imbrack√Ω (d. 1657), organist at the Protestant church in Spi≈°sk√© Podhradie, and Samuel Marckfelner (1621‚Äì1674), organist at Levoƒça. In the larger towns, especially in Bratislava, the influence of the Italian concertante style was felt, composers in this vein including Samuel Capricornus (1628‚Äì1665) (who eventually became kapellmeister for a prince of Stuttgart), his successor at the Protestant church in Breatislava, Johann Sigismund Kusser (1626‚Äì1696). By the eighteenth century, Catholic musicians began to take the musical lead over their Protestant colleagues. A highly rated composer was Franti≈°ek Xaver Budinsk√Ω (1676‚Äì1727), who appears to have been a Jesuit lay brother and worked in Trnava, Pre≈°ov, Ko≈°ice, Trenƒç√≠n, and elsewhere in Slovakia. His compositions include three symphonies, the earliest known to have been written in Slovakia. =Nineteenth century= In the first half of the 19th century, a national musical tradition began to develop around Slovakia‚Äôs impressive folk heritage. Modern Slovak music drew from both classical and folk styles. A key figure who began this fusion is J√°n Levoslav Bella, born in Liptovsk√Ω Mikul√°≈° (1843‚Äì1936), a contemporary of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. Slovak modes and melodies can be heard clearly in his third string quartet, as well as in many of his other works. He also wrote the first opera to be performed in Slovak, Kov√°ƒç Wieland (Wieland the Smith), written in German in 1880-1890, but premiered in Slovak in Bratislava in 1926. =Modern times= Well-known works from the 20th century include the compositions of Eugen Sucho≈à, Alexander Moyzes, Alexander Albrecht and the operas of J√°n Cikker. The internationally most acknowledged composers of the 21st century are Vladim√≠r God√°r, Peter Breiner, Peter Machajd√≠k and Iris Szeghy. Operatic soprano Lucia Popp was born in Z√°horsk√° Ves. Musical ensembles and festivals Amongst the most significant contemporary orchestral ensembles are the Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra of Bratislava, the State Philharmonic Orchestra of Kosice, the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Slovak Chamber Orchestra (known as the Warchalovci after their founder Bohdan Warchal), and the chamber orchestra Capella Istropolitana. There are opera companies in Bratislava, Ko≈°ice and Bansk√° Bystrica. Music festivals include the annual Bratislava Music Festival (Bratislavsk√© hudobn√© sl√°vnosti), Indian Summer in Levoƒça (Levoƒçsk√© babie leto), Festival of Pie≈°≈•any (Pie≈°≈•ansk√Ω festival), one of longest established festivals, dating from 1955, the Konvergencie Chamber Music Festival founded in 1999 by cellist, Jozef Lupt√°k, Music at Fulla (Hudba u Fullu) in Ru≈æomberok founded 2009 by composer Peter Machajdik, and many others.

He served as bishop of several dioceses, most notably as Archbishop of York and, on two occasions as Lord Chancellor. He is considered a venerable figure in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, his town of birth. Life =Background= Thomas Rotherham was born 24 August 1423 in Rotherham, Yorkshire. He is said to have been the eldest son of Sir Thomas Rotherham of Rotherham by his wife, Dame Alice. From the sixteenth century onwards he was also known by the alternate surname 'Scot', although that surname was not used by Rotherham himself or by his contemporaries. In his will, however, Rotherham does refer to his kinsman John Scott of Ecclesfield, Yorkshire, and it has been speculated that he was the son of Sir John Scott of Scot's Hall in Smeeth, Kent and Agnes Beaufitz.Berry, William, County Genealogies; Pedigrees of the Families of the County of Sussex, (London: Sherwood, Gilbert and Piper), 1830 p. 310 Retrieved 18 September 2013. However this claim is said to have been disproved.Bennett, Henry Leigh, Archbishop Rotherham, (Lincoln: J.W. Ruddock, 1901), pp. 6-7 Retrieved 18 September 2013. =Education= He was first educated as a young boy by a teacher of grammar, who came, according to Thomas, \\"I know not by what fate save it was the Grace of God\\". Afterwards he was sent to the newly founded Eton College to prepare for university entrance. =Appointments to office= Rotherham was educated at King's College, Cambridge, graduating as a Bachelor of Divinity and becoming a Fellow of his college, and lectured on Grammar, Theology, and Philosophy. After his ordination as a priest, he became a prebendary of Lincoln in 1462 and then of Salisbury in 1465. He moved on to powerful positions in the Church, being appointed as Bishop of Rochester in 1468, Bishop of Lincoln in 1472, and then Archbishop of York in 1480, a position he held until 1500.. In 1467, King Edward IV appointed Rotherham as Keeper of the Privy Seal.. He was sent as ambassador to France in 1468 and as joint ambassador to Burgundy in 1471, and in 1475 was entrusted with the office of Lord Chancellor.. Between 1477 and his death, Rotherham was the owner of Barnes Hall in South Yorkshire.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, Landmark Collectors Library, , pp. 51 & 52 =Involvement in intrigue= When Edward IV died in April 1483, Rotherham was one of the celebrants of the funeral mass on 20 April 1483. Immediately after Edward's death, Rotherham sided with dowager queen Elizabeth Woodville in her attempt to deprive Richard, Duke of Gloucester of his role as Lord Protector of the new King, her son Edward V. When Elizabeth sought sanctuary after Richard had taken charge of the king, Rotherham released the Great Seal to her. Though he later recovered it and handed it over to Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, his mishandling of the seal ‚Äì indicative of questionable loyalty, led to his dismissal as Lord Chancellor. On 13 May he was replaced by John Russell, who earlier had also been his successor as Bishop of Lincoln. On 13 June 1483, Rotherham was charged with being involved in a conspiracy between Lord Hastings and the Woodvilles against Richard and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was released in the middle of July. =Retirement= Once again appointed Lord Chancellor in 1485, he was shortly afterwards dismissed by Henry VII. After this he retired from most public work. Death and memorial Rotherham died of the plague in Cawood near York on 29 May 1500. His remains were transferred to a magnificent marble tomb in York Minster in 1506. Endowments Rotherham built part of Lincoln College, Oxford, and increased its endowment; at Cambridge, where he was four times Chancellor and Master of Pembroke Hall, he helped to build the University Library. In 1480 Rotherham endowed a Chapel of Jesus within Rotherham parish church, providing a priest to sing masses for the souls of his ancestors. He founded the College of Jesus in Rotherham as a memorial to his first teacher. The foundations of the red brick College were laid at his birthplace in Brookgate in March 1482 and a licence was granted on 22 January 1483 \\"for the honour and glory of the name of Jesus Christ to found a perpetual College\\". The statutes of the college were dated 1 February 1483. The College of Jesus was to consist of a Provost and three Fellows, all to be in Holy Orders, who must attend church on Sundays and Holy Days. The Fellows were to teach grammar and train the six choristers of Jesus in song and music. They were also to teach promising boys who did not aspire to the priesthood reading, writing, and reckoning, free of charge. If the boys continued to show merit, they should be taught the rudiments of grammar and music. The college was dissolved around 1550 by Edward VI of England and all its possessions seized by the crown. Very little now remains of the original building, although the street is still known as College Street. The teaching of grammar to boys continued at Rotherham after the 1550s. The Rotherham Grammar School looked upon Thomas Rotherham as its founder, took 1483 to be its year of origin, and adopted as its badge the armorial bearings of Thomas Rotherham. The school took its last intake of boys in September 1966 and was progressively phased-out over the following several years. Rotherham is still remembered in the name of Thomas Rotherham College, which is the post-1967 descendant of the Rotherham Grammar School for Boys.

Western rock and pop music, as well as Afrobeat, soukous and other genres have become popular nationwide. The sanza is a popular instrument. The Pygmies have a complex folk music tradition. Polyphony and counterpoint are common components, as is a varied rhythmic structure. The trumpet-based music of the Bandas has also gained some popularity outside the area due to its jazzy structure. The Ngbaka use an unusual instrument called a mbela, which is made with an arched branch and a string strung between the two ends and held in front of the musician's mouth. When the string is struck, the mouth is used to amplify and modulate the tone. Instruments similar to the mbela are sometimes considered the oldest ancestors of all string instruments . The national anthem of the Central African Republic is \\"La Renaissance\\". This song, which has been the anthem since 1960, was written by Barth√©l√©my Boganda (words), the first President of the Central African Republic, and Herbert Pepper, who also composed the melody for the Senegalese national anthem . Popular music Popular music in the Central African Republic generally comes from the music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or elsewhere in Africa; however, Latin, European and American pop are also common, as is jazz and rock and roll. African folktales are very popular as well, like the Panda. Folk music =Banda music= The Banda people have produced some modern popular music, using a trumpet-based kind of jazzy music which UNESCO has called one of the \\"great musicological discoveries of our century\\" . Banda folk music includes ongo, a kind of trumpet made from wood or antelope horn. Ongos are used in ceremonies and rituals, including adolescent initiation rites, in polyphonic ensembles of eighteen trumpets. =Pygmy music= Formally Pygmy music consists of at most only four parts, and can be described as an, \\"ostinato with variations,\\" or similar to a passacaglia, in that it is cyclical. In fact it is based on repetition of periods of equal length, which each singer divides using different rhythmic figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This interesting case of ethnomusicology and ethnomathematics creates a detailed surface and endless variations of not only the same period repeated, but the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or think of their music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up. Pygmy styles include liquindi, or water drumming, and instruments like the bow harp (ieta), ngombi (harp zither) and limbindi (a string bow) (Abram).

Baikal is the deepest lake on Earth () and sculpins occupy even its greatest depths. Evolution and systematics Molecular studies based on mitochondrial DNA suggest that the Abyssocottidae along with other Lake Baikal cottoid fishes, now attributed to the likewise endemic Cottocomephoridae (Baikal sculpins) and Comephoridae (Baikal oilfish), together make a monophyletic group that has originated and diversified within the lake relative recently, since the Pliocene. The ancestors of this species flock comprising more than 30 species belonged to the widespread freshwater sculpin genus Cottus (in Cottidae). The Abyssocottidae itself appears as a natural group within this radiation, except that also the genus Batrachocottus should be included.Tytti Kontula, Sergei V.
