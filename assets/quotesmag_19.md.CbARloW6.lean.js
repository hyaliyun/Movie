A colon often precedes an explanation, a list, a quotation, or a block quotation. It is also used between hours and minutes in time, titles and subtitles of books, city and publisher in citations, chapter and verse in biblical citations, and for salutations in business letters and other formal letter writing. History The English word \\"colon\\" is from Latin ' ( '), itself from Ancient Greek (), meaning \\"limb\\", \\"member\\", or \\"portion\\". In Greek rhetoric and prosody, the term did not refer to punctuation but to the expression or passage itself. A \\"colon\\" was a section of a complete thought or passage. From this usage, in palaeography, a colon is a clause or group of clauses written as a line in a manuscript.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"colon, n.¬≤\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1891. In the punctuation system devised by Aristophanes of Byzantium in the 3rd century BC, the end of such a clause was thought to occasion a medium-length breath and was marked by a middot . (This was only intermittently used, but eventually revived as the ano teleia, the modern Greek semicolon.Nicolas, Nick. \\"Greek Unicode Issues: Punctuation \\". 2005. Accessed 7 October 2014.) A double dot symbol , meanwhile, later came to be used as a full stop or to mark a change of speaker. A variant was introduced to English orthography around 1600, marking a pause intermediate between a comma and a full stop.John Bullokar's An English expositor (1616) glosses Colon as \\"A marke of a sentence not fully ended which is made with two prickes.\\" As late as the 18th century, the appropriateness of a colon was still being related to the length of the pause taken when reading the text aloud, but silent reading eventually replaced this with other considerations.John Mason's work, An Essay on Elocution (1748), notes that \\"A Comma Stops the Voice while we may privately tell one, a Semi Colon two; a Colon three: and a Period four.\\" In British English, it was once common for a colon to be followed by a hyphen or dash to indicate a restful pause, in a typographical construction known as the \\"dog's bollocks\\", though this usage is now discouraged. Usage in English In modern English usage, a complete sentence precedes a colon, while a list, description, explanation, or definition follows it. The elements which follow the colon may or may not be a complete sentence: since the colon is preceded by a sentence, it is a complete sentence whether what follows the colon is another sentence or not. While it is acceptable to capitalize the first letter after the colon in American English, it is not the case in British English, except where a proper noun immediately follows a colon. ;Colon used before list :Daequan was so hungry that he ate everything in the house: chips, cold pizza, pretzels and dip, hot dogs, peanut butter, and candy. ;Colon used before a description :Bertha is so desperate that she'll date anyone, even William: he's uglier than a squashed toad on the highway, and that's on his good days. ;Colon before definition :For years while I was reading Shakespeare's Othello and criticism on it, I had to constantly look up the word \\"egregious\\" since the villain uses that word: outstandingly bad or shocking. ;Colon before explanation :I guess I can say I had a rough weekend: I had chest pain and spent all Saturday and Sunday in the emergency room. Some writers use fragments (incomplete sentences) before a colon for emphasis or stylistic preferences (to show a character's voice in literature), as in this example: :Dinner: chips and juice. What a well-rounded diet I have. The Bedford Handbook describes several uses of a colon. For example, one can use a colon after an independent clause to direct attention to a list, an appositive or a quotation, and it can be used between independent clauses if the second summarizes or explains the first. In non- literary or non-expository uses, one may use a colon after the salutation in a formal letter, to indicate hours and minutes, to show proportions, between a title and subtitle, and between city and publisher in bibliographic entries. Luca Serianni, an Italian scholar who helped to define and develop the colon as a punctuation mark, identified four punctuational modes for it: syntactical-deductive, syntactical-descriptive, appositive, and segmental. Syntactical-deductive The colon introduces the logical consequence, or effect, of a fact stated before. :There was only one possible explanation: the train had never arrived. Syntactical-descriptive In this sense the colon introduces a description; in particular, it makes explicit the elements of a set. :I have three sisters: Daphne, Rose, and Suzanne. Syntactical-descriptive colons may separate the numbers indicating hours, minutes, and seconds in abbreviated measures of time. :The concert begins at 21:45. :The rocket launched at 09:15:05. British English, however, more frequently uses a point for this purpose: :The programme will begin at 8.00 pm. :You will need to arrive by 14.30. A colon is also used in the descriptive location of a book verse if the book is divided into verses, such as in the Bible or the Quran: :\\"Isaiah 42:8\\" :\\"Deuteronomy 32:39\\" :\\"Quran 10:5\\" Appositive :Luruns could not speak: he was drunk.Example quoted in An Educational Companion to Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss An appositive colon also separates the subtitle of a work from its principal title. Dillon has noted the impact of colons on scholarly articles, but the reliability of colons as a predictor of quality or impact has also been challenged. In titles, neither needs to be a complete sentence as titles do not represent expository writing: :Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi Segmental Like a dash or quotation mark, a segmental colon introduces speech. The segmental function was once a common means of indicating an unmarked quotation on the same line. The following example is from the grammar book The King's English: :Benjamin Franklin proclaimed the virtue of frugality: A penny saved is a penny earned. This form is still used in written dialogues, such as in a play. The colon indicates that the words following an individual's name are spoken by that individual. :Patient: Doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains. :Doctor: Pull yourself together! Use of capitals Use of capitalization or lower-case after a colon varies. In British English, and in most Commonwealth countries, the word following the colon is in lower case unless it is normally capitalized for some other reason, as with proper nouns and acronyms. British English also capitalizes a new sentence introduced by colon's segmental use. American English goes further and permits writers to similarly capitalize the first word of any independent clause following a colon. This follows the guidelines of some modern American style guides, including those published by the Associated Press and the Modern Language Association. The Chicago Manual of Style, however, requires capitalization only when the colon introduces a direct quotation, a direct question, or two or more complete sentences. In many European languages, the colon is usually followed by a lower-case letter unless the upper case is required for other reasons, as with British English. German usage requires capitalization of independent clauses following a colon.Duden Newsletter vom 24.08.2001 Dutch further capitalizes the first word of any quotation following a colon, even if it is not a complete sentence on its own. Spacing In print, a thin space was traditionally placed before a colon and a thick space after it. In modern English-language printing, no space is placed before a colon and a single space is placed after it. In French-language typing and printing, the traditional rules are preserved. One or two spaces may be and have been used after a colon. The older convention (designed to be used by monospaced fonts) was to use two spaces after a colon. Usage in other languages Suffix separator In Finnish and Swedish, the colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the apostrophe in the English possessive case, connecting a grammatical suffix to an abbreviation or initialism, a special symbol, or a digit (e.g., Finnish USA:n and Swedish USA:s for the genitive case of \\"USA\\", Finnish %:ssa for the inessive case of \\"%\\", or Finnish 20:een for the illative case of \\"20\\"). Abbreviation mark Written Swedish uses colons in contractions, such as S:t for Sankt (Swedish for \\"Saint\\") ‚Äì for example in the name of the Stockholm metro station S:t Eriksplan. This can even occur in people's names, for example Antonia Ax:son Johnson (Ax:son for Axelson). Early Modern English texts also used colons to mark abbreviations. Compare: End of sentence or verse In Armenian, a colon indicates the end of a sentence, similar to a Latin full stop or period. In Hebrew, the Sof pasuq is used in some writings such as prayer books to signal the end of a verse. See also colon (letter) for the use of a colon-like character as an alphabetic character rather than as punctuation. Mathematics and logic The colon is used in mathematics, cartography, model building, and other fields‚Äîin this context it denotes a ratio or a scale, as in 3:1 (pronounced \\"three to one\\"). When a ratio is reduced to a simpler form, such as 10:15 to 2:3, this may be expressed with a double colon as 10:15::2:3; this would be read \\"10 is to 15 as 2 is to 3\\". This form is also used in tests of logic where the question of \\"Dog is to Puppy as Cat is to _____?\\" can be expressed as \\"Dog:Puppy::Cat:_____\\". In some languages (e.g. German, Russian and French), the colon is the commonly used sign for division (instead of √∑). The notation  :  may also denote the index of a subgroup. The notation indicates that is a function with domain and codomain . The combination with an equal sign () is used for definitions. In mathematical logic, when using set-builder notation for describing the characterizing property of a set, it is used as an alternative to a vertical bar (which is the ISO 31-11 standard), to mean \\"such that\\". Example: :S = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : 1 < x < 3 \\\\\\\\} (S is the set of all in \\\\mathbb{R} (the real numbers) such that is strictly greater than 1 and strictly smaller than 3) In older literature on mathematical logic, it is used to indicate how expressions should be bracketed (see Glossary of Principia Mathematica). In type theory and programming language theory, the colon sign after a term is used to indicate its type, sometimes as a replacement to the \\"‚àà\\" symbol. Example: :\\\\lambda x . x \\\\mathrel{:} A \\\\to A . A colon is also sometimes used to indicate a tensor contraction involving two indices, and a double colon (::) for a contraction over four indices. A colon is also used to denote a parallel sum operation involving two operands (many authors, however, instead use a ‚à• sign and a few even a ‚àó for this purpose). Computing The character was on early typewriters and therefore appeared in most text encodings, such as Baudot code and EBCDIC. It was placed at code 58 in ASCII and from there inherited into Unicode. Unicode also defines several related characters. , used in IPA. *, used in IPA. *, used by Uralic Phonetic Alphabet. *, compatible with right-to-left text. *, for mathematical usage. *, for use in pretty-printing programming languages.  , see colon (letter), sometimes used in Windows filenames as it is identical to the colon in the Segoe UI font used for filenames. The colon itself is not permitted as it is a reserved character. *, compatibility character for the Chinese Standard GB 18030. *, for compatibility with half/full width fonts. *, compatibility character for the Chinese National Standard CNS 11643. Programming languages A number of programming languages, most notably Pascal and Ada, use a colon immediately followed by an equals sign (\`:=\`) as the assignment operator, to distinguish it from a single equals which is an equality test (C instead used a single equals as assignment, and a double equals as the equality test). Many languages including C, C++ and DOS batch files use the colon to indicate the text before it is a label, such as a target for a goto or an introduction to a case in a switch statement. In a related use, Python uses a colon to separate a control statement from the block of statements it controls: if test(x): print(\\"test(x) is true!\\") else: print(\\"test(x) is not true...\\") In a number of languages, including JavaScript and Python, colons are used to define name-value pairs in a dictionary or object. This is also used by data formats such as JSON. Some other languages use an equals sign. var obj = { name: \\"Charles\\", age: 18, } The colon is used as part of the ?: conditional operator in C and many other languages. C++ uses a double colon as the scope resolution operator, and class member access. Most other languages use a period but C++ had to use this for compatibility with C. Erlang uses a single colon for scope resolution. In BASIC, it is used as a separator between the statements or instructions in a single line. Most other languages use a semicolon, but BASIC had used semicolon to separate items in print statements. In Forth, a colon precedes definition of a new word. Haskell uses a colon (pronounced as \\"cons\\", short for \\"construct\\") as an operator to add an element to the front of a list:Real World Haskell by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen \\"child\\" : [\\"woman\\", \\"man\\"] -- equals [\\"child\\",\\"woman\\",\\"man\\"] while a double colon \`::\` is read as \\"has type of\\" (compare scope resolution operator): (\\"text\\", False) :: ([Char], Bool) The ML languages (including Standard ML and OCaml) have the above reversed, where the double colon (\`::\`) is used to add an element to the front of a list; and the single colon (\`:\`) is used for type guards. MATLAB uses the colon as a binary operator that generates vectors, as well as to select particular portions of existing matrices. APL uses the colon * to introduce a control structure element. In this usage it must be the first non- blank character of the line. * after a label name that will be the target of a \`:goto\` or a right-pointing arrow (Note: this style of programming is deprecated and programmers are encouraged to use control structures instead). * to separate a guard (boolean expression) from its expression in a dynamic function. Two colons are used for an Error guard (one or more error numbers). * Colon + space are used in class definitions to indicate inheritance. * ‚ç† (a colon in a box) is used by APL for its variant operator. The colon is also used in many operating systems commands. In the esoteric programming language INTERCAL, the colon is called \\"two-spot\\" and is used to identify a 32-bit variable‚Äîdistinct from a spot (.) which identifies a 16-bit variable. Addresses Internet URLs use the colon to separate the protocol (such as ) from the hostname or IP address. In an IPv6 address colons (and one optional double colon) separate up to 8 groups of 16 bits in hexadecimal representation.Hinden, R.; Deering, S. (Februari 2006) IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture. IETF. RFC4291. In a URL a colon follows the initial scheme name (such as HTTP and FTP), and separates a port number from the hostname or IP address. In Microsoft Windows filenames, the colon is reserved for use in alternate data streams and cannot appear in a filename. It was used as the directory separator in Classic Mac OS, and was difficult to use in early versions of the newer BSD-based macOS due to code swapping the slash and colon to try to preserve this usage. In most systems it is often difficult to put a colon in a filename as the shell interprets it for other purposes. CP/M and early versions of MSDOS required the colon after the names of devices, such as though this gradually disappeared except for disks (where it had to be between the disk name and the required path representation of the file as in \`C:\\\\Windows\\\\\`). This then migrated to use in URLs.Berners-Lee, T.; Fielding, R.; Masinter, L. (January 2005). Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax IETF. STD66, RFC3986. Text markup It is often used as a single post-fix delimiter, signifying a token keyword had immediately preceded it or the transition from one mode of character string interpretation to another related mode. Some applications, such as the widely used MediaWiki, utilize the colon as both a pre-fix and post-fix delimiter. In wiki markup, the colon is often used to indent text. Common usage includes separating or marking comments in a discussion as replies, or to distinguish certain parts of a text. In human-readable text messages, a colon, or multiple colons, is sometimes used to denote an action (similar to how asterisks are used) or to emote (for example, in vBulletin). In the action denotation usage it has the inverse function of quotation marks, denoting actions where unmarked text is assumed to be dialogue. For example: :Tom: Pluto is so small; it should not be considered a planet. It is tiny! :Mark: Oh really? ::drops Pluto on Tom's head:: Still think it's small now? Colons may also be used for sounds, e.g., ::click::, though sounds can also be denoted by asterisks or other punctuation marks. Colons can also be used to represent eyes in emoticons.

The Franco-Prussian War had led to the capture of Emperor Napoleon III in September 1870, the collapse of the Second French Empire, and the beginning of the Third Republic. Because Paris was under siege for four months, the Third Republic moved its capital to Tours. A hotbed of working-class radicalism, Paris was primarily defended during this time by the radical troops of the National Guard rather than regular Army troops. Paris surrendered to the Prussians on 28 January 1871, and in February Adolphe Thiers, the new chief executive of the French national government, signed an armistice with Prussia that disarmed the Army but not the National Guard. On 18 March, soldiers of the Commune's National Guard killed two French army generals, and the Commune refused to accept the authority of the French government. The Commune governed Paris for two months, until it was suppressed by the regular French Army during \\"La semaine sanglante\\" (\\"The Bloody Week\\") beginning on 21 May 1871.Robert Tombs, The War Against Paris, 1871 (1981). Debates over the policies and outcome of the Commune had significant influence on the ideas of Karl Marx, who described it as the first example of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\".Rougerie, Jacques, Paris libre- 1871. pp. 264‚Äì270 Prelude On 2 September 1870, France was defeated at the Battle of Sedan in the Franco- Prussian War, and Emperor Napoleon III was captured. When the news reached Paris the next day, shocked and angry crowds came out into the streets. Empress Eug√©nie, the Emperor's wife and acting Regent at the time, fled the city, and the Government of the Second Empire swiftly collapsed. Republican and radical deputies of the National Assembly went to the H√¥tel de Ville, proclaimed the new French Republic, and formed a Government of National Defence with the intention of continuing the war. The Prussian army marched swiftly toward Paris. Demographics In 1871 France was deeply divided between the large rural, Catholic and conservative population of the French countryside and the more republican and radical cities of Paris, Marseille, Lyon and a few others. In the first round of the 1869 parliamentary elections held under the French Empire, 4,438,000 had voted for the Bonapartist candidates supporting Napoleon III, while 3,350,000 had voted for the republican opposition. In Paris, however, the republican candidates dominated, winning 234,000 votes against 77,000 for the Bonapartists.Milza, 2009a, p. 65 Of the two million people in Paris in 1869, according to the official census, there were about 500,000 industrial workers, or fifteen per cent of all the industrial workers in France, plus another 300,000‚Äì400,000 workers in other enterprises. Only about 40,000 were employed in factories and large enterprises; most were employed in small industries in textiles, furniture and construction. There were also 115,000 servants and 45,000 concierges. In addition to the native French population, there were about 100,000 immigrant workers and political refugees, the largest number being from Italy and Poland. During the war and the siege of Paris, various members of the middle- and upper-classes departed the city; at the same time there was an influx of refugees from parts of France occupied by the Germans. The working class and immigrants suffered the most from the lack of industrial activity due to the war and the siege; they formed the bedrock of the Commune's popular support. Radicalisation of the Paris workers The Commune resulted in part from growing discontent among the Paris workers.Haupt/Hausen 1979, pp. 74‚Äì75 This discontent can be traced to the first worker uprisings, the Canut revolts, in Lyon and Paris in the 1830sEdwards 1971, p. 1 (a canut was a Lyonnais silk worker, often working on Jacquard looms). Many Parisians, especially workers and the lower-middle classes, supported a democratic republic. A specific demand was that Paris should be self-governing with its own elected council, something enjoyed by smaller French towns but denied to Paris by a national government wary of the capital's unruly populace. They also wanted a more \\"just\\" way of managing the economy, if not necessarily socialist, summed up in the popular appeal for \\"la r√©publique d√©mocratique et sociale!\\" (\\"the democratic and social republic!\\"). Socialist movements, such as the First International, had been growing in influence with hundreds of societies affiliated to it across France. In early 1867, Parisian employers of bronze- workers attempted to de-unionise their workers. This was defeated by a strike organised by the International. Later in 1867, a public demonstration in Paris was answered by the dissolution of its executive committee and the leadership being fined. Tensions escalated: Internationalists elected a new committee and put forth a more radical programme, the authorities imprisoned their leaders, and a more revolutionary perspective was taken to the International's 1868 Brussels Congress. The International had considerable influence even among unaffiliated French workers, particularly in Paris and the large cities. The killing of journalist Victor Noir incensed Parisians, and the arrests of journalists critical of the Emperor did nothing to quiet the city. The German military attach√©, Waldersee, wrote in his diary in February: \\"Every night isolated barricades were thrown up, constructed for the most part out of disused conveyances, especially omnibuses, a few shots were fired at random, and scenes of disorder were taken part in by a few hundreds of persons, mostly quite young\\". He noted, however, that \\"working-men, as a class, took no part in the proceedings.\\" A coup was attempted in early 1870, but tensions eased significantly after the plebiscite in May. The war with Prussia, initiated by Napoleon III in July, was initially met with patriotic fervour. Radicals and revolutionaries Louis Auguste Blanqui, leader of the Commune's far-left faction, was imprisoned for the entire time of the Commune. Paris was the traditional home of French radical movements. Revolutionaries had gone into the streets to oppose their governments during the popular uprisings of July 1830 and June 1848, and on many other occasions. Of the radical and revolutionary groups in Paris at the time of the Commune, the most conservative were the \\"radical republicans\\". This group included the young doctor and future prime minister Georges Clemenceau, who was a member of the National Assembly and Mayor of the 18th arrondissement. Clemenceau tried to negotiate a compromise between the Commune and the government, but neither side trusted him; he was considered extremely radical by the provincial deputies of rural France, but too moderate by the leaders of the Commune. The most extreme revolutionaries in Paris were the followers of Louis Auguste Blanqui, a charismatic professional revolutionary who had spent most of his adult life in prison. He had about a thousand followers, many of them armed and organized into cells of ten persons each. Each cell operated independently and was unaware of the members of the other groups, communicating only with their leaders by code. Blanqui had written a manual on revolution, Instructions for an Armed Uprising, to give guidance to his followers. Though their numbers were small, the Blanquists provided many of the most disciplined soldiers and several of the senior leaders of the Commune. Defenders of Paris By 20 September 1870, the German army had surrounded Paris and was camped just from the French front lines. The regular French Army in Paris, under General Trochu's command, had only 50,000 professional soldiers of the line; the majority of the French first-line soldiers were prisoners of war, or trapped in Metz, surrounded by Germans. The regulars were thus supported by around 5,000 firemen, 3,000 gendarmes, and 15,000 sailors.Milza, 2009b, pp. 143‚Äì145 The regulars were also supported by the Garde Mobile, new recruits with little training or experience. 17,000 of them were Parisian, and 73,000 from the provinces. These included twenty battalions of men from Brittany, who spoke little French. The largest armed force in Paris was the Garde Nationale, or National Guard, numbering about 300,000 men. They also had very little training or experience. They were organised by neighbourhoods; those from the upper- and middle-class arrondissements tended to support the national government, while those from the working-class neighbourhoods were far more radical and politicised. Guardsmen from many units were known for their lack of discipline; some units refused to wear uniforms, often refused to obey orders without discussing them, and demanded the right to elect their own officers. The members of the National Guard from working-class neighbourhoods became the main armed force of the Commune. Siege of Paris; first demonstrations Eug√®ne Varlin led several thousand National Guard soldiers to march to the Hotel de Ville chanting \\"Long Live the Commune!\\" As the Germans surrounded the city, radical groups saw that the Government of National Defence had few soldiers to defend itself, and launched the first demonstrations against it. On 19 September, National Guard units from the main working-class neighbourhoods‚ÄîBelleville, Menilmontant, La Villette, Montrouge, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and the Faubourg du Temple‚Äîmarched to the centre of the city and demanded that a new government, a Commune, be elected. They were met by regular army units loyal to the Government of National Defence, and the demonstrators eventually dispersed peacefully. On 5 October, 5,000 protesters marched from Belleville to the Hotel de Ville, demanding immediate municipal elections and rifles. On 8 October, several thousand soldiers from the National Guard, led by Eug√®ne Varlin of the First International, marched to the centre chanting 'Long Live the Commune!\\", but they also dispersed without incident. Later in October, General Louis Jules Trochu launched a series of armed attacks to break the German siege, with heavy losses and no success. The telegraph line connecting Paris with the rest of France had been cut by the Germans on 27 September. On 6 October, Defense Minister L√©on Gambetta departed the city by balloon to try to organise national resistance against the Germans.Milza, 2009b, pp. 143‚Äì165 Uprising of 31 October Revolutionary units of the National Guard briefly seized the Hotel de Ville on 31 October 1870, but the uprising failed. On 28 October, the news arrived in Paris that the 160,000 soldiers of the French army at Metz, which had been surrounded by the Germans since August, had surrendered. The news arrived the same day of the failure of another attempt by the French army to break the siege of Paris at Bourget, with heavy losses. On 31 October, the leaders of the main revolutionary groups in Paris, including Blanqui, F√©lix Pyat and Louis Charles Delescluze, called new demonstrations at the Hotel de Ville against General Trochu and the government. Fifteen thousand demonstrators, some of them armed, gathered in front of the H√¥tel de Ville in pouring rain, calling for the resignation of Trochu and the proclamation of a commune. Shots were fired from the H√¥tel de Ville, one narrowly missing Trochu, and the demonstrators crowded into the building, demanding the creation of a new government, and making lists of its proposed members.Milza, 2009b, pp. 206‚Äì213 Blanqui, the leader of the most radical faction, established his own headquarters at the nearby Prefecture of the Seine, issuing orders and decrees to his followers, intent upon establishing his own government. While the formation of the new government was taking place inside the H√¥tel de Ville, however, units of the National Guard and Garde Mobile loyal to General Trochu arrived and recaptured the building without violence. By three o'clock, the demonstrators had been given safe passage and left, and the brief uprising was over. On 3 November, city authorities organized a plebiscite of Parisian voters, asking if they had confidence in the Government of National Defence. \\"Yes\\" votes totalled 557,996, while 62,638 voted \\"no\\". Two days later, municipal councils in each of the twenty arrondissements of Paris voted to elect mayors; five councils elected radical opposition candidates, including Delescluze and a young Montmartrean doctor, Georges Clemenceau.Milza, 2009b, pp. 212‚Äì213 Negotiations with the Germans; continued war In September and October Adolphe Thiers, the leader of the National Assembly conservatives, had toured Europe, consulting with the foreign ministers of Britain, Russia, and Austria, and found that none of them were willing to support France against the Germans. He reported to the Government that there was no alternative to negotiating an armistice. He travelled to German-occupied Tours and met with Bismarck on 1 November. The Chancellor demanded the cession of all of Alsace, parts of Lorraine, and enormous reparations. The Government of National Defence decided to continue the war and raise a new army to fight the Germans. The newly organized French armies won a single victory at Coulmiers on 10 November, but an attempt by General Auguste-Alexandre Ducrot on 29 November at Villiers to break out of Paris was defeated with a loss of 4,000 soldiers, compared with 1,700 German casualties. Everyday life for Parisians became increasingly difficult during the siege. In December temperatures dropped to , and the Seine froze for three weeks. Parisians suffered shortages of food, firewood, coal and medicine. The city was almost completely dark at night. The only communication with the outside world was by balloon, carrier pigeon, or letters packed in iron balls floated down the Seine. Rumours and conspiracy theories abounded. Because supplies of ordinary food ran out, starving denizens ate most of the city zoo's animals, and then having eaten those, Parisians resorted to feeding on rats. By early January 1871, Bismarck and the Germans themselves were tired of the prolonged siege. They installed seventy-two 120- and 150-mm artillery pieces in the forts around Paris and on 5 January began to bombard the city day and night. Between 300 and 600 shells hit the centre of the city every day.Milza, 2009b, pp. 257‚Äì259 Uprising and armistice Between 11 and 19 January 1871, the French armies had been defeated on four fronts and Paris was facing a famine. General Trochu received reports from the prefect of Paris that agitation against the government and military leaders was increasing in the political clubs and in the National Guard of the working-class neighbourhoods of Belleville, La Chapelle, Montmartre, and Gros-Caillou. At midday on 22 January, three or four hundred National Guards and members of radical groups‚Äîmostly Blanquists‚Äîgathered outside the H√¥tel de Ville. A battalion of Gardes Mobiles from Brittany was inside the building to defend it in case of an assault. The demonstrators presented their demands that the military be placed under civil control, and that there be an immediate election of a commune. The atmosphere was tense, and in the middle of the afternoon, gunfire broke out between the two sides; each side blamed the other for firing first. Six demonstrators were killed, and the army cleared the square. The government quickly banned two publications, Le Reveil of Delescluze and Le Combat of Pyat, and arrested 83 revolutionaries. At the same time as the demonstration in Paris, the leaders of the Government of National Defence in Bordeaux had concluded that the war could not continue. On 26 January, they signed a ceasefire and armistice, with special conditions for Paris. The city would not be occupied by the Germans. Regular soldiers would give up their arms, but would not be taken into captivity. Paris would pay an indemnity of 200 million francs. At Jules Favre's request, Bismarck agreed not to disarm the National Guard, so that order could be maintained in the city. Adolphe Thiers; parliamentary elections of 1871 Adolphe Thiers, the chief executive of the French Government during the Commune The national government in Bordeaux called for national elections at the end of January, held just ten days later on 8 February. Most electors in France were rural, Catholic and conservative, and this was reflected in the results; of the 645 deputies assembled in Bordeaux on February, about 400 favoured a constitutional monarchy under either Henri, Count of Chambord (grandson of Charles X) or Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (grandson of Louis Philippe).Milza, 2009b, pp. 420‚Äì421 Of the 200 republicans in the new parliament, 80 were former Orl√©anists (Philippe's supporters) and moderately conservative. They were led by Adolphe Thiers, who was elected in 26 departments, the most of any candidate. There were an equal number of more radical republicans, including Jules Favre and Jules Ferry, who wanted a republic without a monarch, and who felt that signing the peace treaty was unavoidable. Finally, on the extreme left, there were the radical republicans and socialists, a group that included Louis Blanc, L√©on Gambetta and Georges Clemenceau. This group was dominant in Paris, where they won 37 of the 42 seats.Milza, 2009b, p. 421 On 17 February the new Parliament elected the 74-year-old Thiers as chief executive of the French Third Republic. He was considered to be the candidate most likely to bring peace and to restore order. Long an opponent of the Prussian war, Thiers persuaded Parliament that peace was necessary. He travelled to Versailles, where Bismarck and the German Emperor were waiting, and on 24 February the armistice was signed. Establishment Dispute over cannons of Paris A contemporary sketch of women and children helping take two National Guard cannons to Montmartre At the end of the war 400 obsolete muzzle-loading bronze cannons, partly paid for by the Paris public via a subscription, remained in the city. The new Central Committee of the National Guard, now dominated by radicals, decided to put the cannons in parks in the working-class neighborhoods of Belleville, Buttes- Chaumont and Montmartre, to keep them away from the regular army and to defend the city against any attack by the national government. Thiers was equally determined to bring the cannons under national-government control. Clemenceau, a friend of several revolutionaries, tried to negotiate a compromise; some cannons would remain in Paris and the rest go to the army. However, Thiers and the National Assembly did not accept his proposals. The chief executive wanted to restore order and national authority in Paris as quickly as possible, and the cannons became a symbol of that authority. The Assembly also refused to prolong the moratorium on debt collections imposed during the war; and suspended two radical newspapers, Le Cri du Peuple of Jules Valles and Le Mot d'Ordre of Henri Rochefort, which further inflamed Parisian radical opinion. Thiers also decided to move the National Assembly and government from Bordeaux to Versailles, rather than to Paris, to be farther away from the pressure of demonstrations, which further enraged the National Guard and the radical political clubs.Milza, 2009a, pp. 8‚Äì9 On 17 March 1871, there was a meeting of Thiers and his cabinet, who were joined by Paris mayor Jules Ferry, National Guard commander General D'Aurelle de Paladines and General Joseph Vinoy, commander of the regular army units in Paris. Thiers announced a plan to send the army the next day to take charge of the cannons. The plan was initially opposed by War Minister Adolphe Le Fl√¥, D'Aurelle de Paladines, and Vinoy, who argued that the move was premature, because the army had too few soldiers, was undisciplined and demoralized, and that many units had become politicized and were unreliable. Vinoy urged that they wait until Germany had released the French prisoners of war, and the army returned to full strength. Thiers insisted that the planned operation must go ahead as quickly as possible, to have the element of surprise. If the seizure of the cannon was not successful, the government would withdraw from the centre of Paris, build up its forces, and then attack with overwhelming force, as they had done during the uprising of June 1848. The Council accepted his decision, and Vinoy gave orders for the operation to begin the next day.Milza, 2009a, pp. 9‚Äì11 Failed seizure attempt and government retreat A Battery in the Montmartre Hills. The killing of Generals Cl√©ment-Thomas (above) and Lecomte by national guardsmen on 18 March sparked the armed conflict between the French Army and the National Guard. Early in the morning of 18 March, two brigades of soldiers climbed the butte of Montmartre, where the largest collection of cannons, 170 in number, were located. A small group of revolutionary national guardsmen were already there, and there was a brief confrontation between the brigade led by General Claude Lecomte, and the National Guard; one guardsman, named Turpin, was shot dead. Word of the shooting spread quickly, and members of the National Guard from all over the neighbourhood, including Clemenceau, hurried to the site to confront the soldiers. While the Army had succeeded in securing the cannons at Belleville and Buttes-Chaumont and other strategic points, at Montmartre a crowd gathered and continued to grow, and the situation grew increasingly tense. The horses that were needed to move the cannon away did not arrive, and the army units were immobilized. As the soldiers were surrounded, they began to break ranks and join the crowd. General Lecomte tried to withdraw, and then ordered his soldiers to load their weapons and fix bayonets. He thrice ordered them to fire, but the soldiers refused. Some of the officers were disarmed and taken to the city hall of Montmartre, under the protection of Clemenceau. General Lecomte and the officers of his staff were seized by the guardsmen and his mutinous soldiers and taken to the local headquarters of the National Guard at the ballroom of the Chateau-Rouge. The officers were pelted with rocks, struck, threatened, and insulted by the crowd. In the middle of the afternoon Lecomte and the other officers were taken to 6 Rue des Rosiers by members of a group calling themselves The Committee of Vigilance of the 18th arrondissement, who demanded that they be tried and executed.Milza, 2009a, pp. 16‚Äì18 At 5:00 in the afternoon, the National Guard had captured another important prisoner: General Jacques Leon Cl√©ment-Thomas. An ardent republican and fierce disciplinarian, he had helped suppress the armed uprising of June 1848 against the Second Republic. Because of his republican beliefs, he had been arrested by Napoleon III and exiled, and had only returned to France after the downfall of the Empire. He was particularly hated by the national guardsmen of Montmartre and Belleville because of the severe discipline he imposed during the siege of Paris.Milza, 2009a, pp. 18‚Äì19 Earlier that day, dressed in civilian clothes, he had been trying to find out what was going on, when he was recognized by a soldier and arrested, and brought to the building at Rue des Rosiers. At about 5:30 on 18 March, the angry crowd of national guardsmen and deserters from Lecomte's regiment at Rue des Rosiers seized Cl√©ment-Thomas, beat him with rifle butts, pushed him into the garden, and shot him repeatedly. A few minutes later, they did the same to General Lecomte. Doctor Guyon, who examined the bodies shortly afterwards, found forty balls in the body of Cl√©ment-Thomas and nine balls in the back of Lecomte.Milza, 2009a, p. 19 By late morning, the operation to recapture the cannons had failed, and crowds and barricades were appearing in all the working-class neighborhoods of Paris. General Vinoy ordered the army to pull back to the Seine, and Thiers began to organise a withdrawal to Versailles, where he could gather enough troops to take back Paris. On the afternoon of 18 March, following the government's failed attempt to seize the cannons at Montmartre, the Central Committee of the National Guard ordered the three battalions to seize the H√¥tel de Ville, where they believed the government was located. They were not aware that Thiers, the government, and the military commanders were at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where the gates were open and there were few guards. They were also unaware that Marshal Patrice MacMahon, the future commander of the forces against the Commune, had just arrived at his home in Paris, having just been released from imprisonment in Germany. As soon as he heard the news of the uprising, he made his way to the railway station, where national guardsmen were already stopping and checking the identity of departing passengers. A sympathetic station manager hid him in his office and helped him board a train, and he escaped the city. While he was at the railway station, national guardsmen sent by the Central Committee arrived at his house looking for him.Milza, 2009a, p. 76 On the advice of General Vinoy, Thiers ordered the evacuation to Versailles of all the regular forces in Paris, some 40,000 soldiers, including those in the fortresses around the city; the regrouping of all the army units in Versailles; and the departure of all government ministries from the city. National Guard takes power national guards on 18 March 1871. Barricades during the Paris Commune, near the Place de la Concorde In February, while the national government had been organising in Bordeaux, a new rival government had been organised in Paris. The National Guard had not been disarmed as per the armistice, and had on paper 260 battalions of 1,500 men each, a total of 390,000 men.Milza, 2009a, p. 35 Between 15 and 24 February, some 500 delegates elected by the National Guard began meeting in Paris. On 15 March, just before the confrontation between the National Guard and the regular army over the cannons, 1,325 delegates of the federation of organisations created by the National Guard elected a leader, Giuseppe Garibaldi (who was in Italy and respectfully declined the title), and created a Central Committee of 38 members, which made its headquarters in a school on the Rue Basfroi, between Place de la Bastille and La Roquette. The first vote of the new Central Committee was to refuse to recognise the authority of General D'Aurelle de Paladines, the official commander of the National Guard appointed by Thiers, or of General Vinoy, the Military Governor of Paris.Milza, 2009a, p. 45 Late on 18 March, when they learned that the regular army was leaving Paris, units of the National Guard moved quickly to take control of the city. The first to take action were the followers of Blanqui, who went quickly to the Latin Quarter and took charge of the gunpowder stored in the Pantheon, and to the Orleans railway station. Four battalions crossed the Seine and captured the prefecture of police, while other units occupied the former headquarters of the National Guard at the Place Vend√¥me, as well as the Ministry of Justice. That night, the National Guard occupied the offices vacated by the government; they quickly took over the Ministries of Finance, the Interior, and War. At eight in the morning the next day, the Central Committee was meeting in the H√¥tel de Ville. By the end of the day, 20,000 national guardsmen camped in triumph in the square in front of the H√¥tel de Ville, with several dozen cannons. A red flag was hoisted over the building.Milza, 2009a, p. 77 The extreme-left members of the Central Committee, led by the Blanquists, demanded an immediate march on Versailles to disperse the Thiers government and to impose their authority on all of France; but the majority first wanted to establish a more solid base of legal authority in Paris. The Committee officially lifted the state of siege, named commissions to administer the government, and called elections for 23 March. They also sent a delegation of mayors of the Paris arrondissements, led by Clemenceau, to negotiate with Thiers in Versailles to obtain a special independent status for Paris. On 22 March 1871, demonstrators holding banners declaring them to be \\"Friends of Peace\\" were blocked from entering the Place Vend√¥me by guardsmen who, after being fired on, opened fire on the crowd. At least 12 people were killed and many wounded. Council elections The celebration of the election of the Commune, 28 March 1871 In Paris, hostility was growing between the elected republican mayors, including Clemenceau, who believed that they were legitimate leaders of Paris, and the Central Committee of the National Guard.Milza, 2009a, p. 97 On 22 March, the day before the elections, the Central Committee declared that it, not the mayors, was the legitimate government of Paris.Milza, 2009a, p. 103 It declared that Clemenceau was no longer the Mayor of Montmartre, and seized the city hall there, as well as the city halls of the 1st and 2nd arrondissements, which were occupied by more radical national guardsmen. \\"We are caught between two bands of crazy people,\\" Clemenceau complained, \\"those sitting in Versailles and those in Paris.\\" The elections of 26 March elected a Commune council of 92 members, one for every 20,000 residents. Ahead of the elections, the Central Committee and the leaders of the International gave out their lists of candidates, mostly belonging to the extreme left. The candidates had only a few days to campaign. Thiers' government in Versailles urged Parisians to abstain from voting. When the voting was finished, 233,000 Parisians had voted, out of 485,000 registered voters, or forty-eight percent. In upper- class neighborhoods many abstained from voting: 77 percent of voters in the 7th and 8th arrondissements; 68 percent in the 15th, 66 percent in the 16th, and 62 percent in the 6th and 9th. But in the working-class neighborhoods, turnout was high: 76 percent in the 20th arrondissement, 65 percent in the 19th, and 55 to 60 percent in the 10th, 11th, and 12th.Rougerie, Jacques, La Commune de Paris, pp. 58‚Äì60 A few candidates, including Blanqui (who had been arrested when outside Paris, and was in prison in Brittany), won in several arrondissements. Other candidates who were elected, including about twenty moderate republicans and five radicals, refused to take their seats. In the end, the Council had just 60 members. Nine of the winners were Blanquists (some of whom were also from the International); twenty-five, including Delescluze and Pyat, classified themselves as \\"Independent Revolutionaries\\"; about fifteen were from the International; the rest were from a variety of radical groups. One of the best-known candidates, Georges Clemenceau, received only 752 votes. The professions represented in the council were 33 workers; five small businessmen; 19 clerks, accountants and other office staff; twelve journalists; and a selection of workers in the liberal arts. 20 members are Freemasons. All were men; women were not allowed to vote.Milza, 2009a, pp. 109‚Äì113 The winners were announced on 27 March, and a large ceremony and parade by the National Guard was held the next day in front of the H√¥tel de Ville, decorated with red flags. Organisation and early work The new Commune held its first meeting on 28 March in a euphoric mood. The members adopted a dozen proposals, including an honorary presidency for Blanqui; the abolition of the death penalty; the abolition of military conscription; a proposal to send delegates to other cities to help launch communes there; and a resolution declaring that membership in the Paris Commune was incompatible with being a member of the National Assembly. This was aimed particularly at Pierre Tirard, the republican mayor of the 2nd arrondissement, who had been elected to both Commune and National Assembly. Seeing the more radical political direction of the new Commune, Tirard and some twenty republicans decided it was wisest to resign from the Commune. A resolution was also passed, after a long debate, that the deliberations of the Council were to be secret, since the Commune was effectively at war with the government in Versailles and should not make its intentions known to the enemy.Milza, 2009a, pp. 118‚Äì119 Following the model proposed by the more radical members, the new government had no president, no mayor, and no commander in chief. The Commune began by establishing nine commissions, similar to those of the National Assembly, to manage the affairs of Paris. The commissions in turn reported to an Executive Commission. One of the first measures passed declared that military conscription was abolished, that no military force other than the National Guard could be formed or introduced into the capital, and that all healthy male citizens were members of the National Guard. The new system had one important weakness: the National Guard now had two different commanders. They reported to both the Central Committee of the National Guard and to the Executive Commission, and it was not clear which one was in charge of the inevitable war with Thiers' government.Milza, 2009a, p. 129 Administration and actions Programme The Commune returns workmen's tools pawned during the siege. The Commune adopted the discarded French Republican Calendar during its brief existence and used the socialist red flag rather than the republican tricolor. Despite internal differences, the Council began to organise the public services essential for a city of two million residents. It also reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular, and highly democratic social democracy. Because the Commune met on fewer than sixty days in all, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included: * separation of church and state; * remission of rents owed for the entire period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); * abolition of child labour and night work in bakeries; * granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of national guardsmen killed in active service; * free return by pawnshops of all workmen's tools and household items, valued up to 20 francs, pledged during the siege; * postponement of commercial debt obligations, and the abolition of interest on the debts; * right of employees to take over and run an enterprise if it were deserted by its owner; the Commune, nonetheless, recognised the previous owner's right to compensation; * prohibition of fines imposed by employers on their workmen.Marx and the Proletariat: A Study in Social Theory by Timothy McCarthy The decrees separated the church from the state, appropriated all church property to public property, and excluded the practice of religion from schools. In theory, the churches were allowed to continue their religious activity only if they kept their doors open for public political meetings during the evenings. In practice, many churches were closed, and many priests were arrested and held as hostages, in the hope of trading them for Blanqui, imprisoned in Brittany since 17 March.Milza, 2009a The workload of the Commune leaders was usually enormous. The Council members (who were not \\"representatives\\" but delegates, subject in theory to immediate recall by their electors) were expected to carry out many executive and military functions as well as their legislative ones. Numerous organisations were set up during the siege in the localities (quartiers) to meet social needs, such as canteens and first-aid stations. For example, in the 3rd arrondissement, school materials were provided free, three parochial schools were \\"laicised\\", and an orphanage was established. In the 20th arrondissement, schoolchildren were provided with free clothing and food. At the same time, these local assemblies pursued their own goals, usually under the direction of local workers. Despite the moderate reformism of the Commune council, the composition of the Commune as a whole was much more revolutionary. Revolutionary factions included Proudhonists (an early form of moderate anarchism), members of the international socialists, Blanquists, and more libertarian republicans. Feminist initiatives Louise Michel, anarchist and famed \\"Red Virgin of Montmartre\\", became an important part of the legend of the Commune. Women played an important role in both the initiation and the governance of the Commune, though women could not vote in the Commune elections and there were no elected women members of the Commune itself. Their participation included building barricades and caring for wounded fighters. Jos√©phine Marchias, a washer woman, picked up a gun during the battles of May 22-23rd and said, \\"You cowardly crew! Go and Fight! If I'm killed it will be because I've done some killing first!\\" She was arrested as an incendiary, but there is no documentation that she was a p√©troleuse (female incendiary). She worked as a vivandi√©re with the Enfants Perdus. While carrying back the laundry she was given by the guardsmen, she carried away the body of her lover, Jean Guy, who was a butcher's apprentice. There were reports in various newspapers of p√©troleuses but evidence remains weak. The Paris Journal reported that soldiers arrested 13 women who allegedly threw petrol into houses. There were rumours that p√©troleuses were paid 10 francs per house. While clear that Communards set some of the fires, the reports of women participating in it was overly exaggerated at the time. Some women organised a feminist movement, following earlier attempts in 1789 and 1848. Thus, Nathalie Lemel, a socialist bookbinder, and √âlisabeth Dmitrieff, a young Russian exile and member of the Russian section of the First International, created the Women's Union for the Defence of Paris and Care of the Wounded on 11 April 1871. The feminist writer Andr√© L√©o, a friend of Paule Minck, was also active in the Women's Union. Believing that their struggle against patriarchy could only be pursued through a global struggle against capitalism, the association demanded gender and wage equality, the right of divorce for women, the right to secular education, and professional education for girls. They also demanded suppression of the distinction between married women and concubines, and between legitimate and illegitimate children. They advocated the abolition of prostitution (obtaining the closing of the maisons de tol√©rance, or legal brothels). The Women's Union also participated in several municipal commissions and organised cooperative workshops.Women and the Commune, in L'Humanit√©, 19 March 2005 Along with Eug√®ne Varlin, Nathalie Lemel created the cooperative restaurant La Marmite, which served free food for indigents, and then fought during the Bloody Week on the barricades.Fran√ßois Bodinaux, Dominique Plasman, Mich√®le Ribourdouille. \\"On les disait 'p√©troleuses'...\\" Paule Minck opened a free school in the Church of Saint Pierre de Montmartre and animated the Club Saint-Sulpice on the Left Bank. The Russian Anne Jaclard, who declined to marry Dostoyevsky and finally became the wife of Blanquist activist Victor Jaclard, founded the newspaper Paris Commune with Andr√© L√©o. She was also a member of the Comit√© de vigilance de Montmartre, along with Louise Michel and Paule Minck, as well as of the Russian section of the First International. Victorine Brocher, close to the IWA activists, and founder of a cooperative bakery in 1867, also fought during the Commune and the Bloody Week. Louise Michel, the famed \\"Red Virgin of Montmartre\\" (see photo), who would later be deported to New Caledonia, was one of those who symbolised the active participation of a small number of women in the insurrectionary events. A female battalion from the National Guard defended the Place Blanche during the repression. Bank of France The Commune named Francis Jourde as the head of the Commission of Finance. A former clerk of a notary, accountant in a bank and employee of the city's bridges and roads department, Jourde maintained the Commune's accounts with prudence. Paris's tax receipts amounted to 20 million francs, with another six million seized at the Hotel de Ville. The expenses of the Commune were 42 million, the largest part going to pay the daily salary of the National Guard. Jourde first obtained a loan from the Rothschild Bank, then paid the bills from the city account, which was soon exhausted. The gold reserves of the Bank of France had been moved out of Paris for safety in August 1870, but its vaults contained 88 million francs in gold coins and 166 million francs in banknotes. When the Thiers government left Paris in March, they did not have the time or the reliable soldiers to take the money with them. The reserves were guarded by 500 national guardsmen who were themselves Bank of France employees. Some Communards wanted to appropriate the bank's reserves to fund social projects, but Jourde resisted, explaining that without the gold reserves the currency would collapse and all the money of the Commune would be worthless. The Commune appointed Charles Beslay as the Commissaire of the Bank of France, and he arranged for the Bank to loan the Commune 400,000 francs a day. This was approved by Thiers, who felt that to negotiate a future peace treaty the Germans were demanding war reparations of five billion francs; the gold reserves would be needed to keep the franc stable and pay the indemnity. Jourde's prudence was later condemned by Karl Marx and other Marxists, who felt the Commune should have confiscated the bank's reserves and spent all the money immediately.Karl Marx: Selected Writings (ed. McLellan), pp. 592‚Äì594 Press Le P√®re Duch√™ne looks at the statue of Napoleon on top of the Vend√¥me column, about to be torn down by the Communards. From 21 March, the Central Committee of the National Guard banned the major pro-Versailles newspapers, Le Gaulois and Le Figaro. Their offices were invaded and closed by crowds of the Commune's supporters. After 18 April other newspapers sympathetic to Versailles were also closed. The Versailles government, in turn, imposed strict censorship and prohibited any publication in favour of the Commune. At the same time, the number of pro-Commune newspapers and magazines published in Paris during the Commune expanded exponentially. The most popular of the pro-Commune newspapers was Le Cri du Peuple, published by Jules Valles, which was published from 22 February until 23 May. Another highly popular publication was Le P√®re Duch√™ne, inspired by a similar paper of the same name published from 1790 until 1794; after its first issue on 6 March, it was briefly closed by General Vinoy, but it reappeared until 23 May. It specialised in humour, vulgarity and extreme abuse against the opponents of the Commune.Milza, 2009a, p. 250 A republican press also flourished, including such papers as Le Mot d'Ordre of Henri Rochefort, which was both violently anti-Versailles and critical of the faults and excesses of the Commune. The most popular republican paper was Le Rappel, which condemned both Thiers and the killing of generals Lecomte and Clement-Thomas by the Communards. Its editor Auguste Vacquerie was close to Victor Hugo, whose son wrote for the paper. The editors wrote, \\"We are against the National Assembly, but we are not for the Commune. That which we defend, that which we love, that which we admire, is Paris.\\"Milza, 2009a, p. 253 Religious persecution From the beginning, the Commune had a hostile relationship with the Catholic Church. On 2 April, soon after the Commune was established, it voted a decree accusing the Catholic Church of \\"complicity in the crimes of the monarchy.\\" The decree declared the separation of church and state, confiscated the state funds allotted to the Church, seized the property of religious congregations, and ordered that Catholic schools cease religious education and become secular. Over the next seven weeks, some two hundred priests, nuns and monks were arrested, and twenty-six churches were closed to the public. At the urging of the more radical newspapers, National Guard units searched the basements of churches, looking for evidence of alleged sadism and criminal practices. More extreme elements of the National Guard carried out mock religious processions and parodies of religious services. Early in May, some of the political clubs began to demand the immediate execution of Archbishop Darboy and the other priests in the prison. The Archbishop and a number of priests were executed during Bloody Week, in retaliation for the execution of Commune soldiers by the regular army.Milza, 2009a, pp. 350‚Äì354 Destruction of the Vend√¥me Column Destruction of the Vend√¥me Column during the Paris Commune. The column's destruction realized an official proposition made the previous September by painter Gustave Courbet, who, after the collapse of the Commune, was sentenced to six months in prison and later ordered to pay for putting the column back up. He could never pay, and died soon after in exile. The destruction of the Vend√¥me Column honouring the victories of Napoleon I, topped by a statue of the Emperor, was one of the most prominent civic events during the Commune. It was voted on 12 April by the executive committee of the Commune, which declared that the column was \\"a monument of barbarism\\" and a \\"symbol of brute force and false pride.\\" The idea had originally come from the painter Gustave Courbet, who had written to the Government of National Defence on 4 September calling for the demolition of the column. In October, he had called for a new column, made of melted-down German cannons, \\"the column of peoples, the column of Germany and France, forever federated.\\" Courbet was elected to the Council of the Commune on 16 April, after the decision to tear down the column had already been made. The ceremonial destruction took place on 16 May. In the presence of two battalions of the National Guard and the leaders of the Commune, a band played \\"La Marseillaise\\" and the \\"Chant du D√©part\\". The first effort to pull down the column failed, but at 5:30 in the afternoon the column broke from its base and shattered into three pieces. The pedestal was draped with red flags, and pieces of the statue were taken to be melted down and made into coins.Milza, 2009a, pp. 294‚Äì296 On 12 May another civic event took place: the destruction of Thiers' home on Place Saint- Georges. Proposed by Henri Rochefort, editor of the Le Mot d'Ordre, on 6 April, it had not been voted upon by the Commune until 10 May. According to the decree of the Commune, the works of art were to be donated to the Louvre (which refused them) and the furniture was to be sold, the money to be given to widows and orphans of the fighting. The house was emptied and destroyed on 12 May.Milza, 2009a, pp. 296‚Äì298 War with the national government Map illustrating war between Paris Commune and National government Failure of the march on Versailles In Versailles, Thiers had estimated that he needed 150,000 men to recapture Paris, and that he had only about 20,000 reliable first-line soldiers, plus about 5,000 gendarmes. He worked rapidly to assemble a new and reliable regular army. Most of the soldiers were prisoners of war who had just been released by the Germans, following the terms of the armistice. Others were sent from military units in all of the provinces. To command the new army, Thiers chose Patrice MacMahon, who had won fame fighting the Austrians in Italy under Napoleon III, and who had been seriously wounded at the Battle of Sedan. He was highly popular both within the army and in the country. By 30 March, less than two weeks after the Army's Montmartre rout, it began skirmishing with the National Guard on the outskirts of Paris. In Paris, members of the Military Commission and the Executive Committee of the Commune, as well as the Central Committee of the National Guard, met on 1 April. They decided to launch an offensive against the Army in Versailles within five days. The attack was first launched on the morning of 2 April by five battalions who crossed the Seine at the Pont de Neuilly. The National Guard troops were quickly repulsed by the Army, with a loss of about twelve soldiers. One officer of the Versailles army, a surgeon from the medical corps, was killed; the National Guardsmen had mistaken his uniform for that of a gendarme. Five national guardsmen were captured by the regulars; two were Army deserters and two were caught with their weapons in their hands. General Vinoy, the commander of the Paris Military District, had ordered any prisoners who were deserters from the Army to be shot. The commander of the regular forces, Colonel Georges Ernest Boulanger, went further and ordered that all four prisoners be summarily shot. The practice of shooting prisoners captured with weapons became common in the bitter fighting in the weeks ahead.Milza, 2009a, pp. 138‚Äì139 Despite this first failure, Commune leaders were still convinced that, as at Montmartre, French army soldiers would refuse to fire on national guardsmen. They prepared a massive offensive of 27,000 national guardsmen who would advance in three columns. They were expected to converge at the end of 24 hours at the gates of the Palace of Versailles. They advanced on the morning of 3 April‚Äîwithout cavalry to protect the flanks, without artillery, without stores of food and ammunition, and without ambulances‚Äîconfident of rapid success. They passed by the line of forts outside the city, believing them to be occupied by national guardsmen. In fact the army had re-occupied the abandoned forts on 28 March. The National Guard soon came under heavy artillery and rifle fire; they broke ranks and fled back to Paris. Once again national guardsmen captured with weapons were routinely shot by army units.Milza, 2009a, pp. 141‚Äì152 Decree on Hostages Commune leaders responded to the execution of prisoners by the Army by passing a new order on 5 April‚Äîthe Decree on Hostages. Under the decree, any person accused of complicity with the Versailles government could be immediately arrested, imprisoned and tried by a special jury of accusation. Those convicted by the jury would become \\"hostages of the people of Paris.\\" Article 5 stated, \\"Every execution of a prisoner of war or of a partisan of the government of the Commune of Paris will be immediately followed by the execution of a triple number of hostages held by virtue of article four.\\" Prisoners of war would be brought before a jury, which would decide if they would be released or held as hostages.Milza, 2009a, p. 153 Under the new decree, a number of prominent religious leaders were promptly arrested, including the Abb√© Deguerry, the cur√© of the Madeleine church, and the archbishop of Paris Georges Darboy, who was confined at the Mazas prison. The National Assembly in Versailles responded to the decree the next day; it passed a law allowing military tribunals to judge and punish suspects within 24 hours. √âmile Zola wrote, \\"Thus we citizens of Paris are placed between two terrible laws; the law of suspects brought back by the Commune and the law on rapid executions which will certainly be approved by the Assembly. They are not fighting with cannon shots, they are slaughtering each other with decrees.\\"Zola, Emile, La Cloche, 8 April 1871 Radicalisation The popular journalist F√©lix Pyat became one of the most influential members of the Commune and its Committee for Public Safety. He went into exile during the Bloody Week, was later amnestied and elected to the National Assembly. By April, as MacMahon's forces steadily approached Paris, divisions arose within the Commune about whether to give absolute priority to military defence, or to political and social freedoms and reforms. The majority, including the Blanquists and the more radical revolutionaries, supported by Le Vengeur of Pyat and Le P√®re Duchesne of Vermersch, supported giving the military priority. The publications La Commune, La Justice and Valles' Le Cri du Peuple feared that a more authoritarian government would destroy the kind of social republic they wanted to achieve. Soon, the Council of the Commune voted, with strong opposition, for the creation of a Committee of Public Safety, modelled on the eponymous Committee that carried out the Reign of Terror (1793‚Äì94). Because of the implications carried by its name, many members of the Commune opposed the Committee of Public Safety's creation. The Committee was given extensive powers to hunt down and imprison enemies of the Commune. Led by Raoul Rigault, it began to make several arrests, usually on suspicion of treason, intelligence with the enemy, or insults to the Commune. Those arrested included General Edmond-Charles de Martimprey, the governor of the Invalides, alleged to have caused the assassination of revolutionaries in December 1851‚Äîas well as more recent commanders of the National Guard, including Gustave Cluseret. High religious officials had been arrested: Archbishop Darboy, the Vicar General Abb√© Lagarde, and the Cur√© of the Madeleine Abb√© Deguerry. The policy of holding hostages for possible reprisals was denounced by some defenders of the Commune, including Victor Hugo, in a poem entitled \\"No Reprisals\\" published in Brussels on 21 April.Milza, 2009a, pp. 346‚Äì347 On 12 April, Rigault proposed to exchange Archbishop Darboy and several other priests for the imprisoned Blanqui. Thiers refused the proposal. On 14 May, Rigault proposed to exchange 70 hostages for the extreme-left leader, and Thiers again refused.Milza, 2009a, pp. 345‚Äì350 Composition of the National Guard A barricade constructed by the Commune in April 1871 on the Rue de Rivoli near the Hotel de Ville. The figures are blurred due to the camera's lengthy exposure time, an effect commonly seen in early photographs. Since every able-bodied man in Paris was obliged to be a member of the National Guard, the Commune on paper had an army of about 200,000 men on 6 May; the actual number was much lower, probably between 25,000 and 50,000 men. At the beginning of May, 20 percent of the National Guard was reported absent without leave. The National Guard had hundreds of cannons and thousands of rifles in its arsenal, but only half of the cannons and two-thirds of the rifles were ever used. There were heavy naval cannons mounted on the ramparts of Paris, but few national guardsmen were trained to use them. Between the end of April and 20 May, the number of trained artillerymen fell from 5,445 to 2,340. The officers of the National Guard were elected by the soldiers, and their leadership qualities and military skills varied widely. Gustave Cluseret, the commander of the National Guard until his dismissal on 1 May, had tried to impose more discipline in the army, disbanding many unreliable units and making soldiers live in barracks instead of at home. He recruited officers with military experience, particularly Polish officers who had fled to France in 1863, after Russians crushed the January Uprising; they played a prominent role in the last days of the Commune.Milza, 2009a, p. 317 One of these officers was General Jaroslav Dombrowski, a former Imperial Russian Army officer, who was appointed commander of the Commune forces on the right bank of the Seine. On 5 May, he was appointed commander of the Commune's whole army. Dombrowski held this position until 23 May, when he was killed while defending the city barricades. Capture of Fort Issy One of the key strategic points around Paris was Fort Issy, south of the city near the Porte de Versailles, which blocked the route of the Army into Paris. The fort's garrison was commanded by Leon Megy, a former mechanic and a militant Blanquist, who had been sentenced to 20 years hard labour for killing a policeman. After being freed he had led the takeover of the prefecture of Marseille by militant revolutionaries. When he came back to Paris, he was given the rank of colonel by the Central Committee of the National Guard, and the command of Fort Issy on 13 April. The army commander, General Ernest de Cissey, began a systematic siege and a heavy bombardment of the fort that lasted three days and three nights. At the same time Cissey sent a message to Colonel Megy, with the permission of Marshal MacMahon, offering to spare the lives of the fort's defenders, and let them return to Paris with their belongings and weapons, if they surrendered the fort. Colonel Megy gave the order, and during the night of 29‚Äì30 April, most of the soldiers evacuated the fort and returned to Paris. But news of the evacuation reached the Central Committee of the National Guard and the Commune. Before General Cissey and the Versailles army could occupy the fort, the National Guard rushed reinforcements there and re-occupied all the positions. General Cluseret, commander of the National Guard, was dismissed and put in prison. General Cissey resumed the intense bombardment of the fort. The defenders resisted until the night of 7‚Äì8 May, when the remaining national guardsmen in the fort, unable to withstand further attacks, decided to withdraw. The new commander of the National Guard, Louis Rossel, issued a terse bulletin: \\"The tricolor flag flies over the fort of Issy, abandoned yesterday by the garrison.\\" The abandonment of the fort led the Commune to dismiss Rossel, and replace him with Delescluze, a fervent Communard but a journalist with no military experience.Milza, 2009a, pp. 327‚Äì330 Bitter fighting followed, as MacMahon's army worked their way systematically forward to the walls of Paris. On 20 May, MacMahon's artillery batteries at Montretout, Mont-Valerian, Boulogne, Issy, and Vanves opened fire on the western neighbourhoods of the city‚ÄîAuteuil, Passy, and the Trocadero‚Äîwith shells falling close to l'√âtoile. Dombrowski reported that the soldiers he had sent to defend the ramparts of the city between Point du Jour and Porte d'Auteuil had retreated to the city; he had only 4,000 soldiers left at la Muette, 2,000 at Neuilly, and 200 at Asnieres and Saint Ouen. \\"I lack artillerymen and workers to hold off the catastrophe.\\"Milza, 2009a, p. 337 On 19 May, while the Commune executive committee was meeting to judge the former military commander Cluseret for the loss of the Issy fortress, it received word that the forces of Marshal MacMahon were within the fortifications of Paris. \\"Bloody Week\\"  ' (Bloody Week) was the final assault by the French Armed Forces that ended the Paris Commune. 21 May: Army enters Paris Jaroslav Dombrowski, a Polish exile and former military officer, was one of the few capable commanders of the National Guard. He was killed early in the Bloody Week. The final offensive on Paris by MacMahon's army began early in the morning on Sunday, 21 May. On the front line, soldiers learned from a sympathiser inside the walls that the National Guard had withdrawn from one section of the city wall at Point-du- Jour, and the fortifications were undefended. An army engineer crossed the moat and inspected the empty fortifications, and immediately telegraphed the news to Marshal MacMahon, who was with Thiers at Fort Mont-Val√©rien. MacMahon immediately gave orders, and two battalions passed through the fortifications without meeting anyone, and occupied the Porte de Saint-Cloud and the Porte de Versailles. By four o'clock in the morning, sixty thousand soldiers had passed into the city and occupied Auteuil and Passy.Milza, 2009a, pp. 379‚Äì380 Once the fighting began inside Paris, the strong neighborhood loyalties that had been an advantage of the Commune became something of a disadvantage: instead of an overall planned defence, each \\"quartier\\" fought desperately for its survival, and each was overcome in turn. The webs of narrow streets that made entire districts nearly impregnable in earlier Parisian revolutions had in the centre been replaced by wide boulevards during Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The Versailles forces enjoyed a centralised command and had superior numbers. They had learned the tactics of street fighting and simply tunnelled through the walls of houses to outflank the Communards' barricades. The trial of Gustave Cluseret, the former commander, was still going on at the Commune when they received the message from General Dombrowski that the army was inside the city. He asked for reinforcements and proposed an immediate counterattack. \\"Remain calm,\\" he wrote, \\"and everything will be saved. We must not be defeated!\\".Milza, 2009a, p. 381 When they had received this news, the members of the Commune executive returned to their deliberations on the fate of Cluseret, which continued until eight o'clock that evening. The first reaction of many of the National Guard was to find someone to blame, and Dombrowski was the first to be accused. Rumours circulated that he had accepted a million francs to give up the city. He was deeply offended by the rumours. They stopped when Dombrowski died two days later from wounds received on the barricades. His last reported words were: \\"Do they still say I was a traitor?\\"Milza, 2009a, p. 394 22 May: Barricades, first street battles A barricade on Place Blanche during Bloody Week, whose defenders included Louise Michel and a unit of 30 women On the morning of 22 May, bells rang around the city, and Delescluze, as delegate for war of the Commune, issued a proclamation, posted all over Paris: The Committee of Public Safety issued its own decree: A street in Paris in May 1871, by Maximilien Luce Despite the appeals, only fifteen to twenty thousand persons, including many women and children, responded. The forces of the Commune were outnumbered five-to-one by the army of Marshal MacMahon.Da Costa, Gaston, La Commune vecue, 3 vol. Paris, Librairies-impremeries reunies, 1903‚Äì1905, III, p. 81. Serman, William, La Commune de Paris, p. 348 On the morning of 22 May, the regular army occupied a large area from the Porte Dauphine; to the Champs-de-Mars and the √âcole Militaire, where general Cissey established his headquarters; to the Porte de Vanves. In a short time the 5th corps of the army advanced toward Parc Monceau and Place Clichy, while General Douay occupied the Place de l'√âtoile and General Clichant occupied the Gare Saint-Lazaire. Little resistance was encountered in the west of Paris, but the army moved forward slowly and cautiously, in no hurry. No one had expected the army to enter the city, so only a few large barricades were already in place, on the Rue Saint-Florentin and Rue de l'Op√©ra, and the Rue de Rivoli. Barricades had not been prepared in advance; some nine hundred barricades were built hurriedly out of paving stones and sacks of earth. Many other people prepared shelters in the cellars. The first serious fighting took place on the afternoon of the 22nd, an artillery duel between regular army batteries on the Quai d'Orsay and the Madeleine, and National Guard batteries on the terrace of the Tuileries Palace. On the same day, the first executions of National Guard soldiers by the regular army inside Paris took place; some sixteen prisoners captured on the Rue du Bac were given a summary hearing, and then shot.Milza, Pierre, \\"La Commune\\", p. 391 23 May: Battle for Montmartre; burning of Tuileries Palace Communards defending a barricade on the Rue de Rivoli Ruins of the Tuileries Palace, burned by the Communards on 23 May On 23 May the next objective of the army was the butte of Montmartre, where the uprising had begun. The National Guard had built and manned a circle of barricades and makeshift forts around the base of the butte. The garrison of one barricade, at Chaussee Clignancourt, was defended in part by a battalion of about thirty women, including Louise Michel, the celebrated \\"Red Virgin of Montmartre\\", who had already participated in many battles outside the city. She was seized by regular soldiers and thrown into the trench in front of the barricade and left for dead. She escaped and soon afterwards surrendered to the army, to prevent the arrest of her mother. The battalions of the National Guard were no match for the army; by midday on the 23rd the regular soldiers were at the top of Montmartre, and the tricolor flag was raised over the Solferino tower. The soldiers captured 42 guardsmen and several women, took them to the same house on Rue Rosier where generals Clement-Thomas and Lecomte had been executed, and shot them. On the Rue Royale, soldiers seized the formidable barricade around the Madeleine church; 300 prisoners captured with their weapons were shot there, the largest of the mass executions of the rebels. On the same day, having had little success fighting the army, units of national guardsmen began to take revenge by burning public buildings symbolising the government. The guardsmen led by Paul Brunel, one of the original leaders of the Commune, took cans of oil and set fire to buildings near the Rue Royale and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. Following the example set by Brunel, guardsmen set fire to dozens of other buildings on Rue Saint-Florentin, Rue de Rivoli, Rue de Bac, Rue de Lille, and other streets. The Tuileries Palace, which had been the residence of most of the monarchs of France from Henry IV to Napoleon III, was defended by a garrison of some three hundred National Guard with thirty cannon placed in the garden. They had been engaged in a day-long artillery duel with the regular army. At about seven in the evening, the commander of the garrison, Jules Bergeret, gave the order to burn the palace. The walls, floors, curtains and woodwork were soaked with oil and turpentine, and barrels of gunpowder were placed at the foot of the grand staircase and in the courtyard, then the fires were set. The fire lasted 48 hours and gutted the palace, except for the southernmost part, the Pavillon de Flore. Bergeret sent a message to the Hotel de Ville: \\"The last vestiges of royalty have just disappeared. I wish that the same will happen to all the monuments of Paris.\\"Joanna Richardson, Paris under Siege Folio Society London 1982 p.185 The Richelieu library of the Louvre, connected to the Tuileries, was also set on fire and entirely destroyed. The rest of the Louvre was saved by the efforts of the museum curators and fire brigades.Rene Heron de Villefosse, Histoire de Paris, Bernard Grasset (1959). The father of the author of this book was an assistant curator at the Louvre, and helped put out the fires Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, later a lover of Eleanor Marx, asserted that many of the fires were caused by artillery from the French army, and that women in the Commune were wrongly blamed for arson. The consensus of later historians is that most of the major fires were started by the National Guard and several organised Communard groups; but that few if any fires were started by the Army or by local women.Milza, 2009a, pp. 396‚Äì397 Furthermore, besides public buildings, the National Guard also started fires at the homes of a number of residents associated with the regime of Napoleon III, such as that of the historian and playwright Prosper Merimee, the author of Carmen. 24 May: Burning of Hotel de Ville; executions of Communards, the archbishop and hostages The ruins of the H√¥tel de Ville of Paris, the headquarters of the Commune, burned by the National Guard on 24 May and later rebuilt At two in the morning on 24 May, Brunel and his men went to the Hotel de Ville, which was still the headquarters of the Commune and of its chief executive, Delescluze. Wounded men were being tended in the halls, and some of the National Guard officers and Commune members were changing from their uniforms into civilian clothes and shaving their beards, preparing to escape from the city. Delescluze ordered everyone to leave the building, and Brunel's men set it on fire.Milza, 2009a, pp. 397‚Äì398 The battles resumed at daylight on 24 May, under a sky black with smoke from the burning palaces and ministries. There was no co-ordination or central direction on the Commune side; each neighborhood fought on its own. The National Guard disintegrated, with many soldiers changing into civilian clothes and fleeing the city, leaving between 10,000 and 15,000 Communards to defend the barricades. Delescluze moved his headquarters from the Hotel de Ville to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement. More public buildings were set afire, including the Palais de Justice, the Prefecture de Police, the theatres of Ch√¢telet and Porte-Saint- Martin, and the Church of Saint-Eustache. Most of the Palais de Justice was destroyed, but the Sainte-Chapelle survived. Fires set at the Louvre, Palais- Royal and Notre-Dame were extinguished without causing significant damage.The Paris Commune 1871, Robert Tombs, p.11 As the army continued its methodical advance, the summary executions of captured Communard soldiers by the army continued. Informal military courts were established at the √âcole Polytechnique, Ch√¢telet, the Luxembourg Palace, Parc Monceau, and other locations around Paris. The hands of captured prisoners were examined to see if they had fired weapons. The prisoners gave their identity, sentence was pronounced by a court of two or three gendarme officers, the prisoners were taken out and sentences immediately carried out.Milza, 2009a, p. 401 Amid the news of the growing number of executions carried out by the army in different parts of the city, the Communards carried out their own executions as a desperate and futile attempt at retaliation. Raoul Rigaut, the chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, without getting the authorisation of the Commune, executed one group of four prisoners, before he himself was captured and shot by an army patrol. On 24 May, a delegation of national guardsmen and Gustave Genton, a member of the Committee of Public Safety, came to the new headquarters of the Commune at the city hall of the 11th arrondissment and demanded the immediate execution of the hostages held at the prison of La Roquette. The new prosecutor of the Commune, Th√©ophile Ferr√©, hesitated and then wrote a note: \\"Order to the Citizen Director of La Roquette to execute six hostages.\\" Genton asked for volunteers to serve as a firing squad, and went to the La Roquette prison, where many of the hostages were being held. Genton was given a list of hostages and selected six names, including Georges Darboy, the Archbishop of Paris and three priests. The governor of the prison, M. Fran√ßois, refused to give up the Archbishop without a specific order from the Commune. Genton sent a deputy back to the Prosecutor, who wrote \\"and especially the archbishop\\" on the bottom of his note. Archbishop Darboy and five other hostages were promptly taken out into the courtyard of the prison, lined up against the wall, and shot.Milza, 2009a, pp. 403‚Äì404 25 May: Death of Delescluze Delescluze, the last military leader of the Commune, was shot dead after he stood atop a barricade, unarmed. By the end of 24 May, the regular army had cleared most of the Latin Quarter barricades, and held three- fifths of Paris. MacMahon had his headquarters at the Quai d'Orsay. The insurgents held only the 11th, 12th, 19th and 20th arrondissements, and parts of the 3rd, 5th, and 13th. Delescluze and the remaining leaders of the Commune, about 20 in all, were at the city hall of the 13th arrondissement on Place Voltaire. A bitter battle took place between about 1,500 national guardsmen from the 13th arrondissement and the Mouffetard district, commanded by Walery Wroblewski, a Polish exile who had participated in the uprising against the Russians, against three brigades commanded by General de Cissey.Milza, 2009a, pp. 404‚Äì407 During the course of the 25th the insurgents lost the city hall of the 13th arrondissement and moved to a barricade on Place Jeanne-d'Arc, where 700 were taken prisoner. Wroblewski and some of his men escaped to the city hall of the 11th arrondissement, where he met Delescluze, the chief executive of the Commune. Several of the other Commune leaders, including Brunel, were wounded, and Pyat had disappeared. Delescluze offered Wroblewski the command of the Commune forces, which he declined, saying that he preferred to fight as a private soldier. At about seven-thirty Delescluze put on his red sash of office, walked unarmed to the barricade on the Place du Ch√¢teau-d'Eau, climbed to the top and showed himself to the soldiers, and was promptly shot dead.Lissagaray, Prosper-Olivier, Histoire de la Commune de 1871, pp. 355‚Äì356 26 May: Capture of Place de la Bastille; more executions On the afternoon of 26 May, after six hours of heavy fighting, the regular army captured the Place de la Bastille. The National Guard still held parts of the 3rd arrondissment, from the Carreau du Temple to the Arts-et-Metiers, and the National Guard still had artillery at their strong points at the Buttes-Chaumont and P√®re-Lachaise, from which they continued to bombard the regular army forces along the Canal Saint- Martin.Milza, 2009a, p. 410 A contingent of several dozen national guardsmen led by Antoine Clavier, a commissaire and Emile Gois, a colonel of the National Guard, arrived at La Roquette prison and demanded, at gunpoint, the remaining hostages there: ten priests, thirty-five policemen and gendarmes, and two civilians. They took them first to the city hall of the 20th arrondissement; the Commune leader of that district refused to allow his city hall to be used as a place of execution. Clavier and Gois took them instead to Rue Haxo. The procession of hostages was joined by a large and furious crowd of national guardsmen and civilians who insulted, spat upon, and struck the hostages. Arriving at an open yard, they were lined up against a wall and shot in groups of ten. National guardsmen in the crowd opened fire along with the firing squad. The hostages were shot from all directions, then beaten with rifle butts and stabbed with bayonets.Milza, 2009a, pp. 411‚Äì412 According to Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, a defender of the Commune, a total of 63 people were executed by the Commune during the bloody week. 27‚Äì28 May: Final battles; massacre at P√®re-Lachaise Cemetery Eug√®ne Varlin, one of the leaders of the Commune, was captured and shot by soldiers at Montmartre on 28 May, the last day of the uprising. On the morning of 27 May, the regular army soldiers of Generals Grenier, Ladmirault and Montaudon launched an attack on the National Guard artillery on the heights of the Buttes-Chaumont. The heights were captured at the end of the afternoon by the first regiment of the French Foreign Legion. One of the last remaining strongpoints of the National Guard was the cemetery of P√®re-Lachaise, defended by about 200 men. At 6:00 in the evening, the army used cannon to demolish the gates and the First Regiment of naval infantry stormed into the cemetery. Savage fighting followed around the tombs until nightfall, when the last 150 guardsmen, many of them wounded, were surrounded; and surrendered. The captured guardsmen were taken to the wall of the cemetery, known today as the Communards' Wall, and shot.Milza, 2009a, pp. 413‚Äì414 On 28 May, the regular army captured the last remaining positions of the Commune, which offered little resistance. In the morning the regular army captured La Roquette prison and freed the remaining 170 hostages. The army took 1,500 prisoners at the National Guard position on Rue Haxo, and 2,000 more at Derroja, near P√®re-Lachaise. A handful of barricades at Rue Ramponneau and Rue de Tourville held out into the middle of the afternoon, when all resistance ceased.Milza, 2009a, p. 414 Communard prisoners and casualties Prisoners and exiles National Guards Hundreds of prisoners who had been captured with weapons in their hands or gunpowder on their hands had been shot immediately. Others were taken to the main barracks of the army in Paris and after summary trials, were executed there. They were buried in mass graves in parks and squares. Not all prisoners were shot immediately; the French Army officially recorded the capture of 43,522 prisoners during and immediately after Bloody Week. Of these, 1,054 were women, and 615 were under the age of 16. They were marched in groups of 150 or 200, escorted by cavalrymen, to Versailles or the Camp de Satory where they were held in extremely crowded and unsanitary conditions until they could be tried. More than half of the prisoners, 22,727 to be exact, were released before trial for extenuating circumstances or on humanitarian grounds. Since Paris had been officially under a state of siege during the Commune, the prisoners were tried by military tribunals. Trials were held for 15,895 prisoners, of whom 13,500 were found guilty. Ninety-five were sentenced to death; 251 to forced labour; 1,169 to deportation, usually to New Caledonia; 3,147 to simple deportation; 1,257 to solitary confinement; 1,305 to prison for more than a year; and 2,054 to prison for less than a year.Milza, 2009a, pp. 431‚Äì432 The Commune's deputy prosecutor Th√©ophile Ferr√©, who handed over six hostages for execution, was executed in November 1871. A separate and more formal trial was held beginning 7 August for the Commune leaders who survived and had been captured, including Th√©ophile Ferr√©, who had signed the death warrant for the hostages, and the painter Gustave Courbet, who had proposed the destruction of the column in Place Vend√¥me. They were tried by a panel of seven senior army officers. Ferr√© was sentenced to death, and Courbet was sentenced to six months in prison, and later ordered to pay the cost of rebuilding the column. He went into exile in Switzerland and died before making a single payment. Five women were also put on trial for participation in the Commune, including the \\"Red Virgin\\" Louise Michel. She demanded the death penalty, but was instead deported to New Caledonia. In October 1871 a commission of the National Assembly reviewed the sentences; 310 of those convicted were pardoned, 286 had their sentences reduced, and 1,295 commuted. Of the 270 condemned to death‚Äî175 in their absence‚Äî25 were shot, including Ferr√© and Gustave Genton, who had selected the hostages for execution.Milza, 2009a, pp. 436‚Äì437 Thousands of Communards, including leaders such as Felix Pyat, succeeded in slipping out of Paris before the end of the battle, and went into exile; some 3,500 going to England, 2,000‚Äì3,000 to Belgium, and 1,000 to Switzerland.Milza, 2009a, p. 440 A partial amnesty was granted on 3 March 1879, allowing 400 of the 600 deportees sent to New Caledonia to return, and 2,000 of the 2,400 prisoners sentenced in their absence. A general amnesty was granted on 11 July 1880, allowing the remaining 543 condemned prisoners, and 262 sentenced in their absence, to return to France.Rougerie, Jacques, La Commune de 1871, p. 120 Casualties When the battle was over, Parisians buried the bodies of the Communards in temporary mass graves. They were quickly moved to the public cemeteries, where between 6,000 and 7,000 Communards were buried. Participants and historians have long debated the number of Communards killed during Bloody Week. The official army report by General F√©lix Antoine Appert mentioned only Army casualties, which amounted, from April through May, to 877 killed, 6,454 wounded, and 183 missing. The report assessed information about Communard casualties only as \\"very incomplete\\".Rapport d'ensemble de M. le G√©n√©ral Appert sur les op√©rations de la justice militaire relatives √† l'insurrection de 1871, Assembl√©e nationale, annexe au proc√®s verbal de la session du 20 juillet 1875 (Versailles, 1875) The issue of casualties during the Bloody Week arose at a National Assembly hearing on 28 August 1871, when Marshal MacMahon testified. Deputy M. Vacherot told him, \\"A general has told me that the number killed in combat, on the barricades, or after the combat, was as many as 17,000 men.\\" MacMahon responded, \\"I don't know what that estimate is based upon; it seems exaggerated to me. All I can say is that the insurgents lost a lot more people than we did.\\" Vacherot continued, \\"Perhaps this number applies to all of the siege, and to the fighting at Forts d'Issy and Vanves.\\" MacMahon replied, \\"the number is exaggerated.\\" Vacherot persisted, \\"It was General Appert who gave me that information. Perhaps he meant both dead and wounded.\\" MacMahon replied, \\"Ah, well, that's different.\\"Deposition de M. le mar√©chal Mac-Mahon (28 August 1871) in Enqu√©te Parlementaire sur l'insurrection du 18 mars 1871 (Paris: Librarie L√©gislative, 1872), p. 183 In 1876 Prosper-Olivier Lissagaray, who had fought on the barricades during Bloody Week, and had gone into exile in London, wrote a highly popular and sympathetic history of the Commune. At the end, he wrote: \\"No one knows the exact number of victims of the Bloody Week. The chief of the military justice department claimed seventeen thousand shot.\\" Lissagaray was referring to General Appert, who had reportedly told a National Assembly deputy that there had been 17,000 Commune casualties. \\"The municipal council of Paris,\\" Lissagaray continued, \\"paid for the burial of seventeen thousand bodies; but a large number of persons were killed or cremated outside of Paris.\\" \\"It is no exaggeration,\\" Lissagaray concluded, \\"to say twenty thousand, a number admitted by the officers.\\"Lissagaray, Prosper-Olivier (1876), Histoire de la Commune de 1871, La Decouverte/Poche (2000). p. 383 In a new 1896 edition Lissagaray emphasized, \\"Twenty thousand men, women and children killed after the fighting in Paris and in the provinces.\\"Lissagaray, Prosper-Olivier (1876), Histoire de la Commune de 1871, La Decouverte/Poche (2000). p. 466 Several historians have accepted the 20,000 figure, among them Pierre Milza,Milza, Pierre, La Commune Alfred CobbanA History of Modern France. Vol 2: 1799‚Äì1861, Penguin Books, 1965. p. 215 and Benedict Anderson. Vladimir Lenin said that Lissagaray's estimate demonstrated ruling-class brutality: \\"20,000 killed in the streets... Lessons: bourgeoisie will stop at nothing.\\"V.I. Lenin, On the Paris Commune, Moscow, Progress Publishers Communards killed in 1871 Between 1878 and 1880, a French historian and member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, Maxime Du Camp, wrote Les Convulsions de Paris. Du Camp had witnessed the last days of the Commune, went inside the Tuileries Palace shortly after the fires were put out, witnessed the executions of Communards by soldiers, and the bodies in the streets. He studied the question of the number of dead, and studied the records of the office of inspection of the Paris cemeteries, which was in charge of burying the dead. Based on their records, he reported that between 20 and 30 May, 5,339 corpses of Communards had been taken from the streets or Paris morgue to the city cemeteries for burial. Between 24 May and 6 September, the office of inspection of cemeteries reported that an additional 1,328 corpses were exhumed from temporary graves at 48 sites, including 754 corpses inside the old quarries near Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, for a total of 6,667.du Camp, Maxime, Les Convulsions de Paris, Hachette, (1881), p. 303. Modern Marxist critics attacked du Camp and his book; Collette Wilson called it \\"a key text in the construction and promulgation of the reactionary memory of the Commune\\" and Paul Lidsky called it \\"the bible of the anti-Communard literature.\\" In 2012, however, historian Robert Tombs made a new study of the Paris cemetery records and placed the number killed between 6,000 and 7,000, confirming du Camp's research. Jacques Rougerie, who had earlier accepted the 20,000 figure, wrote in 2014, \\"the number ten thousand victims seems today the most plausible; it remains an enormous number for the time.\\" Critique Contemporary artists and writers View of the Rue de Rivoli after Bloody Week French writers and artists had strong views about the Commune. Gustave Courbet was the most prominent artist to take part in the Commune, and was an enthusiastic participant and supporter, though he criticised its executions of suspected enemies. On the other side, the young Anatole France described the Commune as \\"A committee of assassins, a band of hooligans [fripouillards], a government of crime and madness.\\"Pivot, Sylvain, \\"La Commune, les Communards, les ecrivains ou la haine et la gloire.\\" December 2003. La revue des Anciens √âl√®ves de l'√âcole Nationale d'Administration\\" The diarist Edmond de Goncourt, wrote, three days after La Semaine Sanglante, \\"...the bleeding has been done thoroughly, and a bleeding like that, by killing the rebellious part of a population, postpones the next revolution... The old society has twenty years of peace before it...\\"Edmond de Goncourt, Jules de Goncourt, Robert Baldick, Pages from the Goncourt Journal (Oxford, 1962), p. 194 On 23 April, George Sand, an ardent republican who had taken part in the 1848 revolution, wrote \\"The horrible adventure continues. They ransom, they threaten, they arrest, they judge. They have taken over all the city halls, all the public establishments, they‚Äôre pillaging the munitions and the food supplies.\\" Soon after the Commune began, Gustave Flaubert wrote to Sand, \\"Austria did not go into Revolution after Sadowa, nor Italy after Novara, nor Russia after Sebastopol! But our good Frenchmen hasten to pull down their house as soon as the chimney takes fire...\\" Near the end of the Commune, Flaubert wrote to her again, \\"As for the Commune, which is about to die out, it is the last manifestation of the Middle Ages.\\" On 10 June, when the Commune was finished, Flaubert wrote to Sand:Correspondence between Gustave Flaubert and George Sand. online-literature.com. Victor Hugo blamed Thiers for his short- sightedness. At the news that the government had failed to have the cannons seized he wrote in his diary, \\"He touched off the fuse to the powder keg. Thiers is premeditated thoughtlessness.\\" Hugo, Victor, Choses vues, 1870‚Äì1885. Paris. Gallimard (1972). . p. 159 On the other hand, he was critical of the Commune but sympathetic to the Communards. At the beginning of April, he moved to Brussels to take care of the family of his son, who had just died. On 9 April, he wrote, \\"In short, this Commune is as idiotic as the National Assembly is ferocious. From both sides, folly.\\" He wrote poems that criticized both the government and the Commune's policy of taking hostages for reprisals, and condemned the destruction of the Vend√¥me Column.Hugo, Victor, L'Ann√©e Terrible On 25 May, during the Bloody Week, he wrote: \\"A monstrous act; they‚Äôve set fire to Paris. They‚Äôve been searching for firemen as far away as Brussels.\\" But after the repression, he offered to give sanctuary to members of the Commune, which, he said, \\"was barely elected, and of which I never approved.\\" He became the most vocal advocate of an amnesty for exiled Communards, finally granted in the 1880s.Milza, 2009a, pp. 457‚Äì460 √âmile Zola, as a journalist for Le S√©maphore de Marseille, reported on the fall of the Commune, and was one of the first reporters to enter the city during Bloody Week. On 25 May he reported: \\"Never in civilised times has such a terrible crime ravaged a great city... The men of the Hotel de Ville could not be other than assassins and arsonists. They were beaten and fled like robbers from the regular army, and took vengeance upon the monuments and houses.... The fires of Paris have pushed over the limit the exasperation of the army. ...Those who burn and who massacre merit no other justice than the gunshot of a soldier.\\"4th letter of Emile Zola on the Commune, 25 May 1871 But on 1 June, when the fighting was over, his tone had changed, \\"The court martials are still meeting and the summary executions continue, less numerous, it's true. The sound of firing squads, which one still hears in the mournful city, atrociously prolongs the nightmare ... Paris is sick of executions. It seems to Paris that they're shooting everyone. Paris is not complaining about the shooting of the members of the Commune, but of innocent people. It believes that, among the pile, there are innocent people, and that it's time that each execution is preceded by at least an attempt at a serious inquiry ... When the echoes of the last shots have ceased, it will take a great deal of gentleness to heal the million people suffering nightmares, those who have emerged, shivering from the fire and massacre.11th letter of Emile Zola on the Commune, 1 June 1871 Anarchists Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included \\"Louise Michel, the Reclus brothers, and Eug√®ne Varlin (the latter executed in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re- opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists could see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised...Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoed Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the 'implementation of the binding mandate' in 1848...and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.\\"\\"The Paris Commune\\" by Anarcho George Woodcock manifests that \\"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the libertarian collectivists Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the bakuninists Elie and Elis√©e Reclus and Louise Michel.\\" Mikhail Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune. He saw the Commune as above all a \\"rebellion against the State,\\" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the State but also revolutionary dictatorship.The Paris Commune and the Idea of the State, Mikhail Bakunin, 1871 In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. Louise Michel was an important anarchist participant in the Paris Commune. Initially she worked as an ambulance woman, treating those injured on the barricades. During the Siege of Paris she untiringly preached resistance to the Prussians. On the establishment of the Commune, she joined the National Guard. She offered to shoot Thiers, and suggested the destruction of Paris by way of vengeance for its surrender. In December 1871, she was brought before the 6th council of war and charged with offences, including trying to overthrow the government, encouraging citizens to arm themselves, and herself using weapons and wearing a military uniform. Defiantly, she vowed to never renounce the Commune, and dared the judges to sentence her to death.Louise Michel, a French anarchist women who fought in the Paris commune Reportedly, Michel told the court, \\"Since it seems that every heart that beats for freedom has no right to anything but a little slug of lead, I demand my share. If you let me live, I shall never cease to cry for vengeance.\\" Following the 1871 Paris Commune, the anarchist movement, as was the whole of the workers' movement, was decapitated and deeply affected for years. Marx, Engels, and Lenin Communists, left- wing socialists, anarchists, and others have seen the Commune as a model for, or a prefiguration of, a liberated society, with a political system based on participatory democracy from the grassroots up. Marx and Engels, Bakunin, and later Lenin, tried to draw major theoretical lessons (in particular as regards the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" and the \\"withering away of the state\\") from the limited experience of the Commune. Marx, in The Civil War in France (1871), written during the Commune, praised the Commune's achievements, and described it as the prototype for a revolutionary government of the future, \\"the form at last discovered\\" for the emancipation of the proletariat. Marx wrote that, \\"Working men's Paris, with its Commune, will be forever celebrated as the glorious harbinger of a new society. Its martyrs are enshrined in the great heart of the working class. Its exterminators, history has already nailed to that eternal pillory from which all of the prayers of their priest will not avail to redeem them.\\"Karl Marx, The Civil War in France, English Edition of 1871 Engels echoed his partner, maintaining that the absence of a standing army, the self-policing of the \\"quarters\\", and other features meant that the Commune was no longer a \\"state\\" in the old, repressive sense of the term. It was a transitional form, moving towards the abolition of the state as such. He used the famous term later taken up by Lenin and the Bolsheviks: the Commune was, he said, the first \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\", a state run by workers and in the interests of workers. But Marx and Engels were not entirely uncritical of the Commune. The split between the Marxists and anarchists at the 1872 Hague Congress of the First International (IWA) may in part be traced to Marx's stance that the Commune might have saved itself had it dealt more harshly with reactionaries, instituted conscription, and centralised decision-making in the hands of a revolutionary direction. The other point of disagreement was the anti-authoritarian socialists' opposition to the Communist conception of conquest of power and of a temporary transitional state: the anarchists were in favour of general strike and immediate dismantlement of the state through the constitution of decentralised workers' councils, as those seen in the Commune. Lenin, like Marx, considered the Commune a living example of the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\". But he criticised the Communards for not having done enough to secure their position, highlighting two errors in particular. The first was that the Communards \\"stopped half way ... led astray by dreams of ... establishing a higher [capitalist] justice in the country ... such institutions as the banks, for example, were not taken over\\". Secondly, he thought their \\"excessive magnanimity\\" had prevented them from \\"destroying\\" the class enemy. For Lenin, the Communards \\"underestimated the significance of direct military operations in civil war; and instead of launching a resolute offensive against Versailles that would have crowned its victory in Paris, it tarried and gave the Versailles government time to gather the dark forces and prepare for the blood-soaked week of May\\". Other commentary National Guard commander Jules Bergeret escaped Paris during the Bloody Week and went into exile in New York, where he died in 1905. The American Ambassador in Paris during the Commune, Elihu Washburne, writing in his personal diary which is quoted at length in noted historian David McCullough's book, The Greater Journey (Simon & Schuster 2011), described the Communards as \\"brigands\\", \\"assassins\\", and \\"scoundrels\\"; \\"I have no time now to express my detestation.... [T]hey threaten to destroy Paris and bury everybody in its ruins before they will surrender.\\" Edwin Child, a young Londoner working in Paris, noted that during the Commune, \\"the women behaved like tigresses, throwing petroleum everywhere and distinguishing themselves by the fury with which they fought\\".Eye-witness accounts quoted in 'Paris under Siege' by Joanna Richardson p.197 (see bibliography) However, it has been argued in recent research that these famous female arsonists of the Commune, or p√©troleuses, may have been exaggerated or a myth.Robert Tombs, The War Against Paris: 1871, Cambridge University Press, 1981, 272 pages Gay Gullickson, Unruly Women of Paris, Cornell Univ Press, 1996, 304 pages > Lissagaray claimed that because of this myth, hundreds of working-class women were murdered in Paris in late May, falsely accused of being p√©troleuses, but he offered no evidence to support his claim. Lissagaray also claimed that the artillery fire by the French army was responsible for probably half of the fires that consumed the city during the Bloody Week. However, photographs of the ruins of the Tuileries Palace, the Hotel de Ville, and other prominent government buildings that burned show that the exteriors were untouched by cannon fire, while the interiors were completely gutted by fire; and prominent Communards such as Jules Bergeret, who escaped to live in New York, proudly claimed credit for the most famous acts of arson. Academic dispute over Thiers' handling of the crisis Historian J.P.T. Bury considers that Thiers tackled the crisis in a ruthless but successful way, thus giving a solid base to the Third Republic. As he put it , \\"the exile of so many extremists enabled the new Republic to [...] develop in a peaceful and orderly fashion.\\" This view is shared by French historian A. Plessis who writes that \\"the crushing of the communards [...] was ultimately to facilitate the advent of the Third Republic.\\" For David Thomson, Thiers had no other option to restore the unity of a country fractured by an overwhelming defeat and innumerable factions. Another French historian, Paul Lidsky, argues that Thiers felt urged by mainstream newspapers and leading intellectuals to take decisive action against ‚Äòthe social and democratic vermin‚Äô (Le Figaro), ‚Äòthose abominable ruffians‚Äô (Comtesse de S√©gur). Even a moderate daily newspaper like le Drapeau tricolore wrote, \\" even though we were to drown this uprising in blood, were we to bury it under the ruins of the burning city, there would be no room for compromise. \\" Theodore Zeldin in France 1848-1945, vol.I goes so far as to say that Thiers deliberately ordered Paris to be evacuated in order to incite part of the population to rise up and eventually have a pretext for crushing Paris as a rebellious force. Influence and legacy The red banner from the Commune brought to Moscow by French communists in June 1924 Kliment Voroshilov is at right, Grigory Zinoviev third from right, Avel Enukidze fourth, and Nikolay Antipov fifth. The Paris Commune inspired other uprisings named or called Communes: in Moscow (December 1905); Budapest (March‚ÄìJuly 1919); Canton (December 1927), most famously, Petrograd (1917), and Shanghai (1927 and 1967). The Commune was regarded with admiration and awe by later Communist and leftist leaders. Vladimir Lenin wrote: \\"We are only dwarves perched on the shoulders of those giants.\\" He celebrated by dancing in the snow in Moscow on the day that his Bolshevik government was more than two months old, surpassing the Commune. The ministers and officials of the Bolshevik government were given the title Commissar, which was borrowed directly from the Commissaires of the Commune. Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow was (and still is) decorated with red banners from the Commune, brought to Moscow in 1924 by French communists.Rougerie, Jacques, Paris libre ‚Äì 1871, p. 264 Stalin wrote: \\"In 1917 we thought that we would form a commune, an association of workers, and that we would put an end to bureaucracy...That is a goal that we are still far from reaching.\\" The Bolsheviks renamed their dreadnought battleship Sevastopol to Parizhskaya Kommuna. In the years of the Soviet Union, the spaceflight Voskhod 1 carried part of a Communard banner. The National Assembly decreed a law on 24 July 1873, for the construction of the Basilica of Sacr√©-C≈ìur on Montmartre, near the location of the cannon park and where General Cl√©ment-Thomas and General Lecomte were killed, specifying that it was to be erected to \\"expiate the crimes of the Commune\\". A plaque and a church, (Our Lady of the Hostages) on rue Haxo mark the place where fifty hostages, including priests, gendarmes and four civilians, were shot by a firing squad.Gregor Dallas, An Exercise in Terror: the Paris Commune 1871, History Today, Volume 39, Issue 2, 1989 A plaque also marks the wall in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery where 147 Communards were executed, commonly known as the Communards' Wall.Cobban, Alfred (1965), A History of Modern France, p. 215. Penguin Books Memorial commemorations are held at the cemetery every year in May to remember the Commune. Another plaque behind the H√¥tel de Ville marks the site of a mass grave of Communards shot by the army. Their remains were later reburied in city cemeteries.A plaque honours the dead of the Commune in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Other communes of 1871 Soon after the Paris Commune took power in Paris, revolutionary and socialist groups in several other French cities tried to establish their own communes. The Paris Commune sent delegates to the large cities to encourage them. The longest-lasting commune outside Paris was that in Marseille, from 23 March to 4 April, which was suppressed with the loss of thirty soldiers and one hundred and fifty insurgents. None of the other Communes lasted more than a few days, and most ended with little or no bloodshed. * Lyon. Lyon had a long history of worker's movements and uprisings. On 28 September 1870, even before the Paris Commune, the anarchist Mikhail Bakunin and socialist Paul Clusaret led an unsuccessful attempt to seize the city hall in Lyon, but were stopped, arrested and expelled from the city by national guardsmen who supported the Republic. On 22 March, when the news of the seizure of power by the Paris Commune reached Lyon, socialist and revolutionary members of the National Guard met and heard a speech by a representative of the Paris Commune. They marched to the city hall, occupied it, and established a Commune of fifteen members, of whom eleven were militant revolutionaries. They arrested the mayor and the prefect of the city, hoisted a red flag over the city hall, and declared support for the Paris Commune. A delegate from the Paris Commune, Charles Amouroux, spoke to an enthusiastic crowd of several thousand people in front of the city hall. However, the following day the national guardsmen from other neighborhoods gathered at the city hall, held a meeting, and put out their own bulletin, declaring that the takeover was a \\"regrettable misunderstanding,\\" and declared their support for the government of the Republic. On 24 March, the four major newspapers of Lyon also repudiated the Commune. On 25 March, the last members of the Commune resigned and left the city hall peacefully. The Commune had lasted only two days.Milza, 2009a, pp. 158‚Äì160 * Saint-√âtienne. On 24 March, inspired by the news from Paris, a crowd of republican and revolutionary workers and national guardsmen invaded the city hall of Saint-√âtienne, and demanded a plebiscite for the establishment of a Commune. Revolutionary members of the National Guard and a unit of regular army soldiers supporting the Republic were both outside the city. The prefect, an engineer named de L'Esp√©e, was meeting with a delegation from the National Guard in his office when a shot was fired outside, killing a worker. The national guardsmen stormed the city hall, capturing the prefect. In the resulting chaos, more shots were fired and the prefect was killed. The National Guard members quickly established an Executive Committee, sent soldiers to occupy the railway station and telegraph office, and proclaimed a Commune, with elections to be held on 29 March. However, on the 26th, the more moderate republican members of the National Guard disassociated themselves from the Commune. An army unit entered the city on the morning of 28 March, and went to the city hall. The few hundred revolutionary national guardsmen still at the city hall dispersed quietly, without any shots being fired.Milza, 2009a, pp. 160‚Äì162 * Marseille. Marseille, even before the Commune, had a strongly republican mayor and a tradition of revolutionary and radical movements. On 22 March, the socialist politician Gaston Cremieux addressed a meeting of workers in Marseille and called upon them to take up arms and to support the Paris Commune. Parades of radicals and socialists went into the street, chanting \\"Long live Paris! Long live the Commune!\\" On 23 March, the Prefect of the city called a mass meeting of the National Guard, expecting they would support the government; but, instead, the national guardsmen, as in Paris, stormed the city hall and took the mayor and prefect prisoner, and declared a Commune, led by a commission of six members, later increased to twelve, composed of both revolutionaries and moderate socialists. The military commander of Marseille, General Espivent de la Villeboisnet, withdrew his troops, along with many city government officials, outside Marseille, to Aubagne, to see what would happen. The revolutionary commission soon split into two factions, one in the city hall and the other in the prefecture, each claiming to be the legal government of the city. On 4 April, General Espivent, with six to seven thousand regular soldiers supported by sailors and National Guard units loyal to the Republic, entered Marseille, where the Commune was defended by about 2,000 national guardsmen. The regular army forces laid siege to the prefecture, defended by about 400 national guardsmen. The building was bombarded by artillery and then stormed by the soldiers and sailors. About 30 soldiers and 150 insurgents were killed. As in Paris, insurgents captured with weapons in hand were executed, and about 900 others were imprisoned. Gaston Cremieux was arrested, condemned to death in June 1871, and executed five months later.Milza, 2009a, pp. 165‚Äì170 * Other cities. There were attempts to establish Communes in other cities. A radical government briefly took charge in the industrial town of Le Creusot, from 24 to 27 March, but left without violence when confronted by the army. The city hall, prefecture and arsenal of Toulouse were taken over by revolutionary national guardsmen on 24 March, but handed back to the army without fighting on 27 March. There was a similar short-lived takeover over the city hall in Narbonne (23‚Äì28 March). In Limoges, no Commune was declared, but from 3 to 5 April revolutionary National Guard soldiers blockaded the city hall, mortally wounded an army colonel, and briefly prevented a regular army unit from being sent to Paris to fight the Commune, before being themselves disarmed by the army.Milza, 2009a, pp. 173‚Äì176 Aftermath * Adolphe Thiers was formally elected the first President of the French Third Republic on August 30, 1871. He was replaced by the more conservative Patrice MacMahon in 1873. In his last years he became an ally of the republicans against the constitutional monarchists in the Assembly. When he died in 1877, his funeral was a major political event. The historian Jules Ferry reported that a million Parisians lined the streets; the funeral procession was led by the republican deputies Leon Gambetta and Victor Hugo. He was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, where one of the final battles of the Commune had been fought. * Patrice MacMahon, the leader of the regular army that crushed the Commune, served as the President of the Third Republic from 1873 to 1879. When he died in 1893, he was buried with the highest military honours at the Invalides. * Georges Clemenceau, the mayor of Montmartre at the beginning of the Commune, became the leader of the Radical Party in the French Chamber of Deputies. He was Prime Minister of France during the crucial years of World War I, and signed the Versailles Treaty, restoring Alsace and Lorraine to France. Some leaders of the Commune, including Delescluze, died on the barricades, but most of the others survived and lived long afterwards, and some of them resumed political careers in France. * Felix Pyat, the radical journalist, slipped out of Paris near the end of the Commune and reappeared as a refugee in London. He was sentenced to death in absentia, but he and the other Communards were granted an amnesty. He returned to France, where he again became active in politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in March 1888, where he sat on the extreme left. He died in 1889. * Louis Auguste Blanqui had been elected the honorary President of the Commune, but he was in prison during its entire duration. He was sentenced to be transported to a penal colony in 1872, but because of his health his sentence was changed to imprisonment. He was elected a Deputy for Bordeaux in April 1879, but was disqualified. After he was released from prison, he continued his career as an agitator. He died after giving a speech in Paris in January 1881. Like Adolphe Thiers, he is buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, where one of the last battles of the Commune was fought. * Louise Michel, the famous \\"Red Virgin\\", was sentenced to transportation to a penal colony in New Caledonia, where she served as a schoolteacher. She received amnesty in 1880, and returned to Paris, where she resumed her career as an activist and anarchist. She was arrested in 1880 for leading a mob that pillaged a bakery, was imprisoned, and then pardoned. She was arrested several more times, and once was freed by the intervention of Georges Clemenceau. She died in 1905, and was buried near her close friend and colleague during the Commune, Th√©ophile Ferr√©, the man who had signed the death warrant for the archbishop of Paris and other hostages. In fiction =Poetry= * Among the first to write about the Commune was Victor Hugo, whose poem \\"Sur une barricade\\", written on 11 June 1871, and published in 1872 in a collection of poems under the name L' Ann√©e terrible, honours the bravery of a twelve-year-old Communard being led to the execution squad. * William Morris' sequence of poems, \\"The Pilgrims of Hope\\" (1885), features a climax set in the Commune.\\"In his later years, the story of the Commune so gripped Morris's imagination that it provided the climax for his long poem, \\"The Pilgrims of Hope\\"... E. P. Thompson, William Morris : Romantic to Revolutionary. London : PM Press, 2013. (p.196). =Novels= * Jules Vall√®s, editor of Le Cri du Peuple, wrote a trilogy Jacques Vingtras: L'Enfant, Le Bachelier, L'insurg√©, between 1878 and 1880, the complete novels being published only in 1886, after his death. * √âmile Zola's 1892 novel La D√©b√¢cle is set against the background of the Franco-Prussian War, the Battle of Sedan and the Paris Commune. * British writer Arnold Bennett's 1908 novel The Old Wives' Tale, is in part set in Paris during the Commune. * Guy Endore's 1933 horror novel The Werewolf of Paris is set during the Paris Commune and contrasts the savagery of the werewolf with the savagery of La Semaine Sanglante. * French writer Jean Vautrin's 1998 novel Le Cri du Peuple deals with the rise and fall of the Commune. The Prix Goncourt winning novel is an account of the tumultuous events of 1871 told in free indirect style from the points of view of a policeman and a Communard tied together by the murder of a child and love for an Italian woman called Miss Pecci. The novel begins with the discovery of the corpse of a woman dumped in the Seine and the subsequent investigation in which the two main protagonists, Grondin and Tarpagnan, are involved. The eponymous newspaper, Le Cri du Peuple, is inspired by the actual Communard newspaper edited by Jules Vall√®s. The book itself is supposedly his account. The painter Gustave Courbet also makes an appearance. * In The Prague Cemetery, Italian author Umberto Eco sets chapter 17 against the background of the Paris Commune. * The Queen of the Night by Alexander Chee (2016) depicts the survival of fictional opera singer Lilliet Berne during the siege of Paris. The novel's heroine also interacts with several notable figures of the day, including George Sand and the Empress Eug√©nie de Montijo. * Several popular British and American novelists of the late 19th century depicted the Commune as a tyranny against which Anglo- Americans and their aristocratic French allies heroically pitted themselves.Albert Boime, Olin Levi Warner's Defense of the Paris Commune, Archives of American Art Journal, Vol. 29, No. 3/4 (1989), (pp. 4, 13) Among the most well-known of these anti-Commune novels are Woman of the Commune (1895, AKA A Girl of the Commune) by G. A. Henty and in the same year, The Red Republic: A Romance of the Commune by Robert W. Chambers. * In Marx Returns by the British writer and filmmaker Jason Barker, the Commune provides the historical context to Karl Marx's revolutionary struggles, and is depicted \\"as a symbol of an unfinished political project.\\" =Theatre= * At least three plays have been set in the Commune: Nederlaget by Nordahl Grieg, Die Tage der Commune by Bertolt Brecht, and Le Printemps 71 by Arthur Adamov. * Berlin performance group Showcase Beat le Mot created Paris 1871 Bonjour Commune (first performed at Hebbel am Ufer in 2010), the final part of a tetralogy dealing with failed revolutions. * New York theatre group The Civilians performed Paris Commune in 2004 and 2008. =Film= * There have been numerous films set in the Commune. Particularly notable is La Commune, which runs for 5¬æ hours and was directed by Peter Watkins. It was made in Montreuil in 2000, and as with most of Watkins' other films it uses ordinary people instead of actors to create a documentary effect. Some participants were the children of cast members from Watkin's masterpiece Edvard Munch (1974). La Commune was shot on film by Odd-Geir Saether, the Norwegian cameraman from the Munch film. * Soviet filmmakers Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg wrote and directed, in 1929, the silent film The New Babylon (Novyy Vavilon) about the Paris Commune. It features Dmitri Shostakovich's first film score. * British filmmaker Ken McMullen has made two films directly or indirectly influenced by the Commune: Ghost Dance (1983) and 1871 (1990). Ghost Dance includes an appearance by French philosopher Jacques Derrida. * Moinak Biswas, Indian filmmaker and Professor of Film Studies at Jadavpur University (Calcutta), showed a split-screen entry connecting the work of 1970s Left filmmaker Ritwik Ghatak with contemporary shots of the Paris Commune at the 11th Shanghai Biennale (2016).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwxZGL4_nto =Other= * The Italian composer Luigi Nono also wrote the opera Al gran sole carico d'amore (In the Bright Sunshine, Heavy with Love), which is based on the Paris Commune. * Comics artist Jacques Tardi translated the Vautrin's novel (listed above) into a comic, which is also called Le Cri du Peuple. * In the long-running British TV series The Onedin Line (episode 27, screened 10 December 1972), shipowner James Onedin is lured into the Commune in pursuit of a commercial debt and finds himself under heavy fire.

Such funds may be kept hidden and maintained separately from money that is used for legitimate purposes. Slush funds may be employed by government or corporate officials in efforts to pay influential people discreetly in return for preferential treatment, advance information (such as non-public information in financial transactions), and other services.Law, Jonathan.

Use of slush funds to influence government activities may be viewed as subversive of the democratic process. In accounting, the term slush fund describes a general ledger account of commingled funds to which all manner of transactions can be posted, with debits and credits cancelling each other.  Examples  Richard Nixon's \\"Checkers speech\\" of 1952 was a somewhat successful effort to dispel a scandal concerning a slush fund of campaign contributions. Years later, Nixon's presidential re-election campaign used slush funds to buy the silence of the \\"White House Plumbers\\".  Etymology  The term slush fund was originally a nautical term: the slush was the fat or grease skimmed from the top of the cauldron when boiling salted meat. Ship officers would sell the fat to tallow makers, with the resulting proceeds kept as a slush fund\\"slush fund, n.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016.

It originated as a ligature of the letters et‚ÄîLatin for \\"and\\".\\"The Ampersand & More\\" with Kory Stamper, part of the \\"Ask the Editor\\" video series at Merriam- Webster.com Etymology Traditionally, when reciting the alphabet in English-speaking schools, any letter that could also be used as a word in itself (\\"A\\", \\"I\\", and, at one point, \\"O\\") was repeated with the Latin expression per se (\\"by itself\\"), as in \\"A per se A\\". It was also common practice to add the sign at the end of the alphabet as if it were the 27th letter, pronounced as the Latin et or later in English as and. As a result, the recitation of the alphabet would end in \\"X, Y, Z, and per se and\\". This last phrase was routinely slurred to \\"ampersand\\" and the term had entered common English usage by 1837. However, in contrast to the 26 letters, the ampersand does not represent a speech sound‚Äîalthough other characters that were dropped from the English alphabet did, such as the Old English thorn, wynn, and eth. It has been falsely claimed that Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re used the symbol in his widely read publications and that people began calling the new shape \\"Amp√®re's and\\".For examples of this misunderstanding, see Jessie Bedford, Elizabeth Godfrey: English Children in the Olden Time, page 22.

Figures 1 through 6 The modern ampersand is virtually identical to that of the Carolingian minuscule. The italic ampersand, to the right, is originally a later et-ligature. Et ligature in Insular script Example of ampersand based on a crossed epsilon, as might be handwritten The ampersand can be traced back to the 1st century A.D. and the Old Roman cursive, in which the letters E and T occasionally were written together to form a ligature (Evolution of the ampersand ‚Äì figure 1). In the later and more flowing New Roman Cursive, ligatures of all kinds were extremely common; figures 2 and 3 from the middle of 4th century are examples of how the et-ligature could look in this script. During the later development of the Latin script leading up to Carolingian minuscule (9th century) the use of ligatures in general diminished. The et- ligature, however, continued to be used and gradually became more stylized and less revealing of its origin (figures 4‚Äì6).Jan Tschichold: \\"Formenwandlung der et-Zeichen.\\" The modern italic type ampersand is a kind of \\"et\\" ligature that goes back to the cursive scripts developed during the Renaissance. After the advent of printing in Europe in 1455, printers made extensive use of both the italic and Roman ampersands. Since the ampersand's roots go back to Roman times, many languages that use a variation of the Latin alphabet make use of it. The ampersand often appeared as a character at the end of the Latin alphabet, as for example in Byrhtfer√∞'s list of letters from 1011. Similarly, was regarded as the 27th letter of the English alphabet, as taught to children in the US and elsewhere. An example may be seen in M. B. Moore's 1863 book The Dixie Primer, for the Little Folks. In her 1859 novel Adam Bede, George Eliot refers to this when she makes Jacob Storey say: \\"He thought it [Z] had only been put to finish off th' alphabet like; though ampusand would ha' done as well, for what he could see.\\" The popular nursery rhyme Apple Pie ABC finishes with the lines \\"X, Y, Z, and ampersand, All wished for a piece in hand\\". The ampersand should not be confused with the Tironian \\"et\\" , which has the same meaning, but which in appearance resembles the numeral . Both symbols have their roots in the classical antiquity, and both signs were used throughout the Middle Ages as a representation for the Latin word et (\\"and\\"). However, while the ampersand was in origin a common ligature in everyday script, the Tironian et was part of a highly specialised stenographic shorthand. The Tironian et (‚Åä) is found in Old Irish language script, a Latin-based script generally only used for decorative purposes today, where it signifies (\\"and\\") in Irish. This symbol may have entered the script language by way of monastic influence in the time of the early Christian church in Ireland. Writing the ampersand In everyday handwriting, the ampersand is sometimes simplified in design as a large lowercase epsilon or a reversed numeral , superimposed by a vertical line. The ampersand is also sometimes shown as an epsilon with a vertical line above and below it or a dot above and below it. The plus sign (itself based on an et-ligature) is often informally used in place of an ampersand, sometimes with an added loop and resembling .

The ampersand is used by the Writers Guild of America to denote two writers collaborating on a specific script, rather than one writer rewriting another's work. In screenplays, two authors joined with & collaborated on the script, while two authors joined with and worked on the script at different times and may not have consulted each other at all. In the latter case, they both contributed enough significant material to the screenplay to receive credit but did not work together. In APA style, the ampersand is used when citing sources in text such as (Jones & Jones, 2005). In the list of references, an ampersand precedes the last author's name when there is more than one author. (This does not apply to MLA style, which calls for the \\"and\\" to be spelled.) The phrase (\\"and so forth\\"), usually written as etc. can be abbreviated &c.; representing the combination et + c(etera). The ampersand can be used to indicate that the \\"and\\" in a listed item is a part of the item's name and not a separator (e.g. \\"Rock, pop, rhythm & blues, and hip hop\\"). The ampersand may still be used as an abbreviation for \\"and\\" in informal writing regardless of how \\"and\\" is used. Computing Encoding and display The character in Unicode is ; this is inherited from the same value in ASCII. Apart from this, Unicode also has the following variants:   * The last six of these are carryovers from the Wingdings fonts, and are meant only for backward compatibility with those fonts. On the QWERTY keyboard layout, the ampersand is . It is almost always available on keyboard layouts, sometimes on or . On the AZERTY keyboard layout, is an unmodified keystroke, positioned above . In URLs, the ampersand must be replaced by \`%26\` when representing a string character to avoid interpretation as a URL syntax character. Programming languages In the 20th century, following the development of formal logic, the ampersand became a commonly used logical notation for the binary operator or sentential connective AND. This usage was adopted in computing. Many languages with syntax derived from C, including C++, Perl, and more differentiate between: * for bitwise AND. is zero, is 4. * for short-circuit logical AND. is true. In C, C++, and Go, a prefix is a unary operator denoting the address in memory of the argument, e.g . In C++ and PHP, unary prefix before a formal parameter of a function denotes pass-by- reference. In Fortran, the ampersand forces the compiler to treat two lines as one. This is accomplished by placing an ampersand at the end of the first line and at the beginning of the second line. In many implementations of ALGOL 60 the ampersand denotes the tens exponent of a real number. In Common Lisp, the ampersand is the prefix for lambda list keywords. Ampersand is the string concatenation operator in many BASIC dialects, AppleScript, Lingo, HyperTalk, and FileMaker. In Ada it applies to all one-dimensional arrays, not just strings. BASIC-PLUS on the DEC PDP-11 uses the ampersand as a short form of the verb . Applesoft BASIC used the ampersand as an internal command, not intended to be used for general programming, that invoked a machine language program in the computer's ROM. In some versions of BASIC, unary suffix & denotes a variable is of type long, or 32 bits in length. The ampersand is occasionally used as a prefix to denote a hexadecimal number, such as for decimal 255, for instance in BBC BASIC. Some other languages, such as the Monitor built into ROM on the Commodore 128, used it to indicate octal instead, a convention that spread throughout the Commodore community and is now used in the VICE emulator. In MySQL, has dual roles. As well as a logical AND, it additionally serves as the bitwise operator of an intersection between elements. Dyalog APL uses ampersand similarly to Unix shells, spawning a separate green thread upon application of a function. In more recent years, the ampersand has made its way into the Haskell standard library, representing flipped function application: means the same thing as . Perl uses the ampersand as a sigil to refer to subroutines: *In Perl 4 and earlier, it was effectively required to call user-defined subroutines *In Perl 5, it can still be used to modify the way user-defined subroutines are called *In Perl 6, the ampersand sigil is only used when referring to a subroutine as an object, never when calling it In MASM 80x86 Assembly Language, is the Substitution Operator, which tells the assembler to replace a macro parameter or text macro name with its actual value.Microsoft MASM Version 6.1 Programmer's Guide Ampersand is the name of a reactive programming language, which uses relation algebra to specify information systems. Text markup In SGML, XML, and HTML, the ampersand is used to introduce an SGML entity, such as (for non- breaking space) or (for the Greek letter Œ±). The HTML and XML encoding for the ampersand character is the entity . This can create a problem known as delimiter collision when converting text into one of these markup languages. For instance, when putting URLs or other material containing ampersands into XML format files such as RSS files the & must be replaced with &amp; or they are considered not well formed, and computers will be unable to read the files correctly. SGML derived the use from IBM Generalized Markup Language, which was one of many IBM-mainframe languages to use the ampersand to signal a text substitution, eventually going back to System/360 macro assembly language. In the plain TeX markup language, the ampersand is used to mark tabstops. The ampersand itself can be applied in TeX with . The Computer Modern fonts replace it with an \\"E.T.\\" symbol in the (text italic) fonts, so it can be entered as in running text when using the default (Computer Modern) fonts. In Microsoft Windows menus, labels, and other captions, the ampersand is used to denote the next letter as a keyboard shortcut (called an \\"Access key\\" by Microsoft). For instance setting a button label to makes it display as rint and for to be a shortcut equivalent to pressing that button. A double ampersand is needed in order to display a real ampersand. This convention originated in the first WIN32 api, and is used in Windows Forms,How to: Create Access Keys for Windows Forms Controls, from msdn.microsoft.com (but not WPF, which uses underscore for this purpose) and is also copied into many other toolkits on multiple operating systems. Sometimes this causes problems similar to other programs that fail to sanitize markup from user input, for instance Navision databases have trouble if this character in either \\"Text\\" or \\"Code\\" fields. Unix shells Some Unix shells use the ampersand as a metacharacter: Some Unix shells, like the POSIX standard \`sh\` shell, use an ampersand to execute a process in the background and to duplicate file descriptors. *In Bash, the ampersand can separate words, control the command history, duplicate file descriptors, perform logical operations, control jobs, and participate in regular expressions. Web standards The generic URL (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax allows for a query string to be appended to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, , is used to indicate the start of a query string.\\"Ampersands in URI attribute values\\" A query string is usually made up of a number of different name‚Äìvalue pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, .

For example: *Sample Text *Sample Text *Sample Text The bullet symbol may take any of a variety of shapes, such as circular, square, diamond or arrow. Typical word processor software offers a wide selection of shapes and colors. Several regular symbols, such as (asterisk), (hyphen), (period), and even (lowercase Latin letter O), are conventionally used in ASCII-only text or other environments where bullet characters are not available. Historically, the index symbol (representing a hand with a pointing index finger) was popular for similar uses. Lists made with bullets are called bulleted lists. The HTML element name for a bulleted list is \\"unordered list\\", because the list items are not arranged in numerical order (as they would be in a numbered list). Usually, bullet points are used to list things.  Usage  Bullets are most often used in technical writing, reference works, notes, and presentations. Example: Where are bullets most often used? * Technical writing * Reference works * Notes * Presentations * Lists An alternative method is to use a numbered list: # Technical writing # Reference works # Notes # Presentations # Lists Other use The glyph is also used as a way to hide passwords or confidential information. For example, the credit card number might be displayed as .  Bullet points  Items-- known as \\"bullet points\\"--may be short phrases, single sentences, or of paragraph length. Bulleted items are not usually terminated with a full stop unless they are complete sentences. In some cases, however, the style guide for a given publication may call for every item except the last one in each bulleted list to be terminated with a semicolon, and the last item with a full stop. It is correct to terminate any bullet point with a full stop if the text within that item consists of one full sentence or more. Bullet points are usually used to highlight list elements.  Computer usage  There have been different ways to encode bullet points in computer systems.  In historical systems  Glyphs such as , and their reversed variants , became available in text mode since early IBM PCs with MDA‚ÄìCGA‚ÄìEGA graphic adapters, because built-in screen fonts contained such forms at code points 7‚Äì10. These were not true characters because such points belong to the C0 control codes range; therefore, these glyphs required a special way to be placed on the screen (see code page 437 for discussion). Prior to the widespread use of word processors, bullets were often denoted by an asterisk; several word processors automatically convert asterisks to bullets if used at the start of line. This notation was inherited by Setext and wiki engines.  In Unicode  There are a variety of Unicode bullet characters, including:  for use in mathematical notation primarily as a dot product instead of interpunct.  ; see Fleuron (typography) ; see Fleuron (typography)  In web pages  To create bulleted list items for a web page, the markup language HTML provides the list tag \` * \`. Each list tag inside an unordered list will generate one bulleted list item.  In Windows  When using the US keyboard, a bullet point character can be produced by pressing 7 on the numpad while keeping Alt pressed.  In LaTeX  To create bulleted list items for a document, the markup language LaTeX provides the item tag \`\\\\item \`. Each item tag inside an itemized list will generate one bulleted list item.  Wiki markup  A list item on a wiki page is indicated using one or more leading asterisks in Wiki markup as well as in many other wikis.  Other forms of use  The bullet is often used for separating menu items, usually in the footer menu. It is common, for example, to see it in latest website designs and in many WordPress themes. It is also used by text editors, like Microsoft Word, to create lists. A variant, the bullet operator () is used as a math symbol, akin to the dot operator.

It is used primarily as a cooling agent. Its advantages include lower temperature than that of water ice and not leaving any residue (other than incidental frost from moisture in the atmosphere). It is useful for preserving frozen foods where mechanical cooling is unavailable. Dry ice sublimates at at Earth atmospheric pressure. This extreme cold makes the solid dangerous to handle without protection due to burns caused by freezing (frostbite). While generally not very toxic, the outgassing from it can cause hypercapnia (abnormally elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) due to buildup in confined locations. Properties Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide (CO2), a molecule consisting of a single carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms. Dry ice is colorless, non-flammable, with a sour zesty odor, and can lower the pH of a solution when dissolved in water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3). Comparison of phase diagrams of carbon dioxide (red) and water (blue) as a log-lin chart with phase transitions points at 1 atmosphere At pressures below 5.13 atm and temperatures below (the triple point), CO2 changes from a solid to a gas with no intervening liquid form, through a process called sublimation.Above the triple point, CO2 goes through the more familiar transitions via a liquid phase. The opposite process is called deposition, where CO2 changes from the gas to solid phase (dry ice). At atmospheric pressure, sublimation/deposition occurs at or 194.65 K. The density of dry ice varies, but usually ranges between about . The low temperature and direct sublimation to a gas makes dry ice an effective coolant, since it is colder than water ice and leaves no residue as it changes state. Its enthalpy of sublimation is 571 kJ/kg (25.2 kJ/mol). Dry ice is non- polar, with a dipole moment of zero, so attractive intermolecular van der Waals forces operate. The composition results in low thermal and electrical conductivity. History It is generally accepted that dry ice was first observed in 1835 by French inventor Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier (1790‚Äì1844), who published the first account of the substance. See also: \\"Solidification of carbonic acid,\\" The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, 8 : 446‚Äì447 (1836).Note: * The Bulletin des Lois du Royaume de France (Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France), 9th series, part ii, no. 92, page 74 (February 1832) lists: \\"24¬∞ M.

The patent describes the machine and its performance in detail. See: (French Ministry of Commerce), \\"Pour le perfectionnement d'une machine √† comprimer le gaz, ‚Ä¶\\" (For the improvement of a machine to compress gas, ‚Ä¶), Description des Machines et Proc√©d√©s consign√©s dans les brevets d'invention, 30 : 251‚Äì267 (1836). In his experiments, it was noted that when opening the lid of a large cylinder containing liquid carbon dioxide, most of the liquid carbon dioxide quickly evaporated. This left only solid dry ice in the container. In 1924, Thomas B. Slate applied for a US patent to sell dry ice commercially. Subsequently, he became the first to make dry ice successful as an industry. In 1925, this solid form of CO2 was trademarked by the DryIce Corporation of America as \\"Dry ice\\", leading to its common name. That same year the DryIce Co. sold the substance commercially for the first time, marketing it for refrigeration purposes. Manufacture Sublimation of dry ice when placed on the surface of water at room temperature Dry ice is easily manufactured. First, gases with a high concentration of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some liquid carbon dioxide vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines . The Energy Institute. London. September 2010. p. 10 Dry ice is typically produced in three standard forms: large blocks, cylindrical small ( diameter) pellets and cylindrical tiny ( diameter), high surface to volume pellets that float on oil or water and do not stick to skin because of their high radii of curvature. Tiny dry ice pellets are used primarily for dry ice blasting, quick freezing, fire fighting, oil solidifying and have been found to be safe for experimentation by middle school students wearing appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves and safety glasses. A standard block weighing approximately covered in a taped paper wrapping is most common. These are commonly used in shipping, because they sublime relatively slowly due to a low ratio of surface area to volume. Pellets are around in diameter and can be bagged easily. This form is suited to small scale use, for example at grocery stores and laboratories where it is stored in a thickly insulated chest. Density of pellets is 60-70% of the density of blocks. Applications Commercial An ice cream cart The most common use of dry ice is to preserve food, using non-cyclic refrigeration. It is frequently used to package items that must remain cold or frozen, such as ice cream or biological samples, without the use of mechanical cooling. Dry ice can be used to flash-freeze food or laboratory biological samples, carbonate beverages, make ice cream, solidify oil spills\\"Zapping Oil Spills with Dry Ice and Ingenuity\\" by Gordon Dillow Los Angeles Times South Bay section page 1 2/24/1994 and stop ice sculptures and ice walls from melting. Dry ice can be used to arrest and prevent insect activity in closed containers of grains and grain products, as it displaces oxygen, but does not alter the taste or quality of foods. For the same reason, it can prevent or retard food oils and fats from becoming rancid. Sublimation Dry ice in water When dry ice is placed in water, sublimation is accelerated, and low-sinking, dense clouds of smoke-like fog are created. This is used in fog machines, at theatres, haunted house attractions, and nightclubs for dramatic effects. Unlike most artificial fog machines, in which fog rises like smoke, fog from dry ice hovers near the ground. Dry ice is useful in theatre productions that require dense fog effects. The fog originates from the bulk water into which the dry ice is placed, and not from atmospheric water vapor (as is commonly assumed). It is occasionally used to freeze and remove warts. However, liquid nitrogen performs better in this role, since it is colder so requires less time to act, and less pressure. Dry ice has fewer problems with storage, since it can be generated from compressed carbon dioxide gas as needed. Plumbers use equipment that forces pressurised liquid CO2 into a jacket around a pipe. The dry ice formed causes the water to freeze, forming an ice plug, allowing them to perform repairs without turning off the water mains. This technique can be used on pipes up to 4 inches (100 mm) in diameter. Dry ice can be used as bait to trap mosquitoes, bedbugs, and other insects, due to their attraction to carbon dioxide. It can be used to exterminate rodents. This is done by dropping pellets into rodent tunnels in the ground and then sealing off the entrance, thus suffocating the animals as the dry ice sublimates. Tiny dry ice pellets can be used to fight fire by both cooling fuel and suffocating the fire by excluding oxygen.\\"Could a Freeze Gun Put Flames on Ice\\" by Zantos Peabody Los Angeles Times local section B3 9/3/2002 The extreme temperature of dry ice can cause viscoelastic materials to change to glass phase. Thus, it is useful for removing many types of pressure sensitive adhesives. Industrial Dry ice blasting used for cleaning a rubber mold Dry ice blasting used for cleaning electrical installations Dry ice can be used for loosening asphalt floor tiles or car sound deadening material making it easy to prise off, as well as freezing water in valveless pipes to enable repair. One of the largest mechanical uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot from a nozzle with compressed air, combining the power of the speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, water blasting or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires. Dry ice is also useful for the de-gassing of flammable vapours from storage tanks ‚Äî the sublimation of dry ice pellets inside an emptied and vented tank causes an outrush of CO2 that carries with it the flammable vapours. The removal and fitting of cylinder liners in large engines requires the use of dry ice to chill and thus shrink the liner so that it freely slides into the engine block. When the liner then warms up, it expands, and the resulting interference fit holds it tightly in place. Similar procedures may be used in fabricating mechanical assemblies with a high resultant strength, replacing the need for pins, keys or welds. Dry-ice blasting, a form of carbon dioxide cleaning, is used in a number of industrial applications. It is also useful as a cutting fluid. Scientific In laboratories, a slurry of dry ice in an organic solvent is a useful freezing mixture for cold chemical reactions and for condensing solvents in rotary evaporators. Dry ice and acetone forms a cold bath of , which can be used for instance to prevent thermal runaway in a Swern oxidation. The process of altering cloud precipitation can be done with the use of dry ice. It was widely used in experiments in the US in the 1950s and early 1960s before it was replaced by silver iodide. Dry ice has the advantage of being relatively cheap and completely non-toxic. Its main drawback is the need to be delivered directly into the supercooled region of clouds being seeded. Dry ice bombs right A \\"dry ice bomb\\" is a balloon-like device using dry ice in a sealed container such as a plastic bottle. Water is usually added to accelerate the sublimation of the dry ice. As the dry ice sublimes, pressure increases, causing the bottle to burst causing a loud noise that can be avoided by replacing the screw cap with a rubber stopper to make a water rocket with a two-liter bottle. The dry ice bomb device was featured on MythBusters, episode 57 Mentos and Soda, which first aired on August 9, 2006. It was also featured in an episode of Time Warp, as well as in an episode of Archer. Extraterrestrial occurrence Following the Mars flyby of the Mariner 4 spacecraft in 1966, scientists concluded that Mars' polar caps consist entirely of dry ice. However, findings made in 2003 by researchers at the California Institute of Technology have shown that Mars' polar caps are almost completely made of water ice, and that dry ice only forms a thin surface layer that thickens and thins seasonally. A phenomenon named dry ice storms was proposed to occur over the polar regions of Mars. They are comparable to Earth's thunderstorms, with crystalline CO2 taking the place of water in the clouds. Dry ice is also proposed as a mechanism for Geysers on Mars. In 2012, the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe detected a cold layer in the atmosphere of Venus where temperatures are close to the triple point of carbon dioxide and it is possible that flakes of dry ice precipitate.A curious cold layer in the atmosphere of Venus. European Space Agency (1 October 2012). Observations from the Uranus flyby by Voyager 2 indicates that dry ice is present on the surface of its large moons Ariel, Umbriel and Titania. Scientist speculate that the magnetic field of Uranus contributes to the generation of CO2 ice on the surfaces of its moons. Voyager 2 observations of Neptune's moon Triton suggested the presence of dry ice on the surface, though follow up observations indicate that the carbon ices on the surface are carbon monoxide but that the moon's crust is composed of a significant quantity of dry ice. Safety Dry ice pellet subliming in water, releasing thick white fog. UN 1845 label for dry ice Prolonged exposure to dry ice can cause severe skin damage through frostbite, and the fog produced may also hinder attempts to withdraw from contact in a safe manner. Because it sublimes into large quantities of carbon dioxide gas, which could pose a danger of hypercapnia, dry ice should only be exposed to open air in a well- ventilated environment. For this reason, dry ice is assigned the S-phrase in the context of laboratory safety. Industrial dry ice may contain contaminants that make it unsafe for direct contact with foodstuffs. Tiny dry ice pellets used in dry ice blast cleaning do not contain oily residues. Although dry ice is not classified as a dangerous substance by the European Union, or as a hazardous material by the United States Department of Transportation for ground transportation, when shipped by air or water, it is regulated as a dangerous good and IATA packing instruction 954 (IATA PI 954) requires that it be labeled specially, including a diamond-shaped black-and white label, UN 1845. Also, arrangements must be in place to ensure adequate ventilation so that pressure build-up does not rupture the packaging. The Federal Aviation Administration in the US allows airline passengers to carry up to per person either as checked baggage or carry-on baggage, when used to refrigerate perishables.

It is not a specialized area of sociology but instead deals with broad fundamental questions about the extent and limits of social influences on individuals' lives and with the social-cultural basis of our knowledge about the world. Complementary to the sociology of knowledge is the sociology of ignorance,The Sociology of Ignorance including the study of nescience, ignorance, knowledge gaps, or non-knowledge as inherent features of knowledge-making. The sociology of knowledge was pioneered primarily by the sociologist √âmile Durkheim at the beginning of the 20th century. His work deals directly with how conceptual thought, language, and logic can be influenced by the societal milieu out of which they arise. In an early work co-written with Marcel Mauss, Primitive Classification, Durkheim and Mauss study \\"primitive\\" group mythology in order to argue that classification systems are collectively based and that the divisions within these systems derive from social categories.Durkheim, Emile, and Marcel Mauss. (1963). Primitive classification. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Later, Durkheim in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life would elaborate his theory of knowledge, examining how language and the concepts and categories (such as space and time) used in logical thought have a sociological origin. While neither Durkheim, nor Mauss, specifically coined nor used the term 'sociology of knowledge', their work is an important first contribution to the field. The specific term 'sociology of knowledge' is said to have been in widespread use since the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking sociologists, most notably Max Scheler and Karl Mannheim, wrote extensively on sociological aspects of knowledge.Max Scheler (ed.). Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens. M√ºnchen und Leipzig: Duncker & Humblot, 1924. Karl Mannheim. Ideology and utopia: an introduction to the sociology of knowledge. Translated by Louis Wirth and Edward Shils. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company; London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., 1936. With the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann in The Social Construction of Reality (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare socially constructed reality). The 'genealogical' and 'archaeological' studies of Michel Foucault are of considerable contemporary influence.  History   The Enlightenment  The Enlightenment movement ought not to be underestimated in its influence upon the social sciences. When these philosophers worked towards a scientific analysis of society, they were engaged in a sociology of ideas and values, albeit their own commitment was to critical rationalism. The Enlightenment strove for progress, change, secularism, but above all, to freedom, the freedom for individuals to decide their own fate. There was a commitment to practical science with mankind at the centre (as opposed to God or gods) and this is the real source of social science. This new science was not interested in revealed knowledge or a priori knowledge but in the workings of humanity: human practices, and social variety and regularities. Western thought, therefore, received a significant movement towards cultural relativism, where cross-cultural comparison became the dominant methodology. Importantly, social science was created by philosophers who sought to turn ideas into actions and to unite theory and practice in an attempt to restructure society as a whole.  Earlier viewpoints  Sociology of knowledge requires a certain viewpoint which was first expounded by Giambattista Vico in his New Science, written in the early 18th Century, a great deal before the first sociologists study the relationship between knowledge and society. In this book, a justification for a new historical and sociological methodology, the main point is that the natural world and the social world are known in different ways. The former is known through external or empirical methods, whilst the latter can be known internally as well as externally. In other words, human history is a construct. This creates a key epistemological distinction between the natural world and the social world which is a central concept in the social sciences. Primarily focused on historical methodology, Vico asserts that in order to study a society's history it is necessary to move beyond a chronicle of events by examining the cultural elements of the society, what was termed the \\"civil world\\". This \\"civil world\\", made up of actions, thoughts, ideas, myths, norms, religious beliefs, and institutions, is the product of the human mind. Since these elements are socially constructed, they can be better understood than the physical world, understood as it is in abstraction. Vico highlights that human nature and its products are not fixed entities and therefore necessitate a historical perspective which emphasizes the changes and developments implicit in individuals and societies. He also emphasizes the dialectical relationship between society and culture as key in this new historical perspective. Vico's ideas, whilst permeated by his own penchant for etymology, and a theory of cyclical history (corsi e ricorsi), are significant nonetheless for the underlying premise that our understanding and knowledge of social structure is dependent upon the ideas and concepts we employ and the language used. Vico, mostly unknown in his own time, was the first to establish the foundations of a sociology of knowledge even if his concepts were not necessarily picked up by later writers. There is some evidence that Montesquieu and Karl Marx had read Vico's work. However the similarities in their works are superficial, limited mainly to the overall conception of their projects, characterised by cultural relativism and historicism. Approaches to Sociology of Knowledge √âmile Durkheim √âmile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917) is credited as having been the first professor to successfully establish the field of sociology, institutionalizing a department of sociology at the Universit√© de Bordeaux in the 1890s.Calhoun, Craig, Joseph Gerteis, James Moody, Steven Pfaff, Kathryn Schmidt, and Intermohan Virk. (2002). Classical sociological theory. Malden, Mass: Blackwell While his works deal with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge. While publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay De quelques formes primitives de classification written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time.Durkheim, 'Conclusion,' Les formes √©l√©mentaires de la vie religieuse, Presses Universitaires de France, 5e √©dition, 2003 In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabula rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori truths (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.Durkheim, 'Introduction,' Les Formes, , and . Another key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of repr√©sentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Repr√©sentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, repr√©sentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).Durkheim, Emile. (1964). The elementary forms of the religious life. London: Allen & Unwin. Arguably the most important \\"repr√©sentation collective\\" is language, which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'repr√©sentations collectives', and language in particular: : \\"add to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.\\"Emile Durkheim, Conclusion, Section III, \\"Elementary Forms of Religious Life\\" trans. Joseph Ward Swain, p. 435 (accessed: https://web.archive.org/web/20130312023652/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/41360/41360-h/41360-h.htm#Page_427) As such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality, an idea developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault. Karl Mannheim The German political philosophers Karl Marx (1818‚Äì1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820‚Äì1895) argued in Die deutsche Ideologie (1846, The German Ideology) and elsewhere that people's ideologies, including their social and political beliefs and opinions, are rooted in their class interests, and more broadly in the social and economic circumstances in which they live: : \\"It is men, who in developing their material inter-course, change, along with this their real existence, their thinking and the products of their thinking. Being is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by being\\" (Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe 1/5). Under the influence of this doctrine, and of Phenomenology, the Hungarian-born German sociologist Karl Mannheim (1893‚Äì1947) gave impetus to the growth of the sociology of knowledge with his Ideologie und Utopie (1929, translated and extended in 1936 as Ideology and Utopia), although the term had been introduced five years earlier by the co-founder of the movement, the German philosopher, phenomenologist and social theorist Max Scheler (1874‚Äì1928), in Versuche zu einer Soziologie des Wissens (1924, Attempts at a Sociology of Knowledge). Mannheim feared that this interpretation could be seen to claim that all knowledge and beliefs are the products of socio-political forces since this form of relativism is self- defeating (if it is true, then it too is merely a product of socio-political forces and has no claim to truth and no persuasive force). Mannheim believed that relativism was a strange mixture of modern and ancient beliefs in that it contained within itself a belief in an absolute truth which was true for all times and places (the ancient view most often associated with Plato) and condemned other truth claims because they could not achieve this level of objectivity (an idea gleaned from Marx). Mannheim sought to escape this problem with the idea of relationism. This is the idea that certain things are true only in certain times and places (a view influenced by pragmatism) however, this does not make them less true. Mannheim felt that a stratum of free-floating intellectuals (who he claimed were only loosely anchored to the class structure of society) could most perfectly realize this form of truth by creating a \\"dynamic synthesis\\" of the ideologies of other groups. Phenomenological sociology Phenomenological sociology is the study of the formal structures of concrete social existence as made available in and through the analytical description of acts of intentional consciousness. The \\"object\\" of such an analysis is the meaningful lived world of everyday life: the \\"Lebenswelt\\", or life-world (Husserl:1889). The task, like that of every other phenomenological investigation, is to describe the formal structures of this object of investigation in subjective terms, as an object-constituted-in- and-for-consciousness (Gurwitsch:1964). That which makes such a description different from the \\"naive\\" subjective descriptions of the man in the street, or those of the traditional, positivist social scientist, is the utilization of phenomenological methods. The leading proponent of phenomenological sociology was Alfred Sch√ºtz (1899‚Äì1959). Sch√ºtz sought to provide a critical philosophical foundation for Max Weber's interpretive sociology through the use of phenomenological methods derived from the transcendental phenomenological investigations of Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938). Husserl's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of intentional consciousness. Sch√ºtz's work was directed at establishing the formal structures of the Life-world (Sch√ºtz:1980). Husserl's work was conducted as a transcendental phenomenology of consciousness. Sch√ºtz's work was conducted as a mundane phenomenology of the Life-world (Natanson:1974). The difference in their research projects lies at the level of analysis, the objects taken as topics of study, and the type of phenomenological reduction that is employed for the purposes of analysis. Ultimately, the two projects should be seen as complementary, with the structures of the latter dependent on the structures of the former. That is, valid phenomenological descriptions of the formal structures of the Life-world should be wholly consistent with the descriptions of the formal structures of intentional consciousness. It is from the latter that the former derives its validity and truth value (Sokolowski:2000). The phenomenological tie-in with the sociology of knowledge stems from two key historical sources for Mannheim's analysis: [1] Mannheim was dependent on insights derived from Husserl's phenomenological investigations, especially the theory of meaning as found in Husserl's Logical Investigations of 1900/1901 (Husserl:2000), in the formulation of his central methodological work: \\"On The Interpretation of Weltanschauung\\" (Mannheim:1993:see fn41 & fn43) ‚Äì this essay forms the centerpiece for Mannheim's method of historical understanding and is central to his conception of the sociology of knowledge as a research program; and [2] The concept of \\"Weltanschauung\\" employed by Mannheim has its origins in the hermeneutic philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, who relied on Husserl's theory of meaning (above) for his methodological specification of the interpretive act (Mannheim: 1993: see fn38). It is also noteworthy that Husserl's analysis of the formal structures of consciousness, and Sch√ºtz's analysis of the formal structures of the Life-world are specifically intended to establish the foundations, in consciousness, for the understanding and interpretation of a social world which is subject to cultural and historical change. The phenomenological position is that although the facticity of the social world may be culturally and historically relative, the formal structures of consciousness, and the processes by which we come to know and understand this facticity, are not. That is, the understanding of any actual social world is unavoidably dependent on understanding the structures and processes of consciousness that found, and constitute, any possible social world. Alternatively, if the facticity of the social world and the structures of consciousness prove to be culturally and historically relative, then we are at an impasse in regard to any meaningful scientific understanding of the social world which is not subjective (as opposed to being objective and grounded in nature [positivism], or inter subjective and grounded in the structures of consciousness [phenomenology]), and relative to the cultural and idealization formations of particular concrete individuals living in a particular socio-historical group. Michel Foucault A particularly important contemporary contribution to the sociology of knowledge is found in the work of Michel Foucault. Madness and Civilization (1961) postulated that conceptions of madness and what was considered \\"reason\\" or \\"knowledge\\" was itself subject to major culture bias ‚Äì in this respect mirroring similar criticisms by Thomas Szasz, at the time the foremost critic of psychiatry, and himself now an eminent psychiatrist. A point where Foucault and Szasz agreed was that sociological processes played the major role in defining \\"madness\\" as an \\"illness\\" and prescribing \\"cures\\". In The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception (1963), Foucault extended his critique to institutional clinical medicine, arguing for the central conceptual metaphor of \\"The Gaze\\", which had implications for medical education, prison design, and the carceral state as understood today. Concepts of criminal justice and its intersection with medicine were better developed in this work than in Szasz and others, who confined their critique to current psychiatric practice. The Order of Things (1966) and The Archeology of Knowledge (1969) introduced abstract notions of mathesis and taxonomia to explain the subjective 'ordering' of the human sciences. These, he claimed, had transformed 17th and 18th century studies of \\"general grammar\\" into modern \\"linguistics\\", \\"natural history\\" into modern \\"biology\\", and \\"analysis of wealth\\" into modern \\"economics\\"; though not, claimed Foucault, without loss of meaning. According to Foucault, the 19th century transformed what knowledge was. Perhaps Foucault's best-known claim was that \\"Man did not exist\\" before the 18th century. Foucault regarded notions of humanity and of humanism as inventions of modernity. Accordingly, a cognitive bias had been introduced unwittingly into science, by over-trusting the individual doctor or scientist's ability to see and state things objectively. Foucault roots this argument in the rediscovery of Kant, though his thought is significantly influenced by Nietzsche ‚Äì that philosopher declaring the \\"death of God\\" in the 19th century, and the anti-humanists proposing the \\"death of Man\\" in the 20th. In Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison, Foucault concentrates on the correlation between knowledge and power. According to him, knowledge is a form of power and can conversely be used against individuals as a form of power. As a result, knowledge is socially constructed. He argues that knowledge forms discourses and discourses form the dominant ideological ways of thinking which govern our lives. For him, social control is maintained in 'the disciplinary society', through codes of control over sexuality and the ideas/knowledge perpetuated through social institutions. In other words, discourses and ideologies subject us to authority and turn people into 'subjected beings', who are in turn afraid of being punished if they sway from social norms. Foucault believes that institutions overtly regulate and control our lives. Institutions such as schools reinforce the dominant ideological forms of thinking onto the populace and force us into becoming obedient and docile beings. Hence, the dominant ideology that serves the interests of the ruling class, all the while appearing as 'neutral', needs to be questioned and must not go unchallenged. Knowledge ecology Knowledge ecology is a concept originating from knowledge management and that aimed at \\"bridging the gap between the static data repositories of knowledge management and the dynamic, adaptive behavior of natural systems\\", and in particular relying on the concept of interaction and emergence. Knowledge ecology, and its related concept information ecology has been elaborated by different academics and practitioners such as Thomas H. Davenport, Bonnie Nardi, or Swidler. New Sociology of Knowledge The New Sociology of Knowledge (a postmodern approach considering knowledge as culture by drawing upon Marxist, French structuralist, and American pragmatist traditions)Doyle McCarthy, Knowledge as Culture: The New Sociology of Knowledge, Routledge, published October 23, 1996, introduces new concepts that dictate how knowledge is socialized in the modern era by new kinds of social organizations and structures.Swidler, A., Arditi, J. 1994.

Merton American sociologist Robert K. Merton (1910‚Äì2003) dedicates a section of Social Theory and Social Structure (1949; revised and expanded, 1957 and 1968) to the study of the sociology of knowledge in Part III, titled The Sociology of Knowledge and Mass Communications. Legitimation code theory Legitimation code theory (LCT) emerged as a framework for the study of knowledge and education and is now being used to analyse a growing range of social and cultural practices across increasingly different institutional and national contexts, both within and beyond education. It is an approach that builds primary on the work of Basil Bernstein and Pierre Bourdieu. It also integrates insights from sociology (including Durkheim, Marx, Weber and Foucault), systemic functional linguistics, philosophy (such as Karl Popper and critical realism), early cultural studies, anthropology (especially Mary Douglas and Ernest Gellner), and other approaches.Maton, K.

Southern Theory Southern theory is an approach to the sociology of knowledge that looks at the global production of sociological knowledge and the dominance of the global northConnell, Raeywyn (2007) Southern Theory: The Global Dynamics of Knowledge in Social Sciences, Allen & Unwin.. It was first developed by major Australian sociologist Raewyn Connell in her book Southern Theory and others at the University of Sydney and elsewhere. Southern theory is a kind of decolonising perspective within the sociology of knowledge that seeks to emphasize perspectives from the global south to counter bias towards the perspectives of theorists and social scientists from the global north.

It is one of the modern descendants of the obelus, a mark used historically by scholars as a critical or highlighting indicator in manuscripts. (The term obelisk derives from the ('), which means \\"little obelus\\"; from (') meaning 'roasting spit'). A double dagger or diesis is a variant with two handles that usually marks a third footnote after the asterisk and dagger. The triple dagger is a variant with three handles and is used by medievalists to indicate another level of notation. History The dagger symbol originated from a variant of the obelus, originally depicted by a plain line or a line with one or two dots . It represented an iron roasting spit, a dart, or the sharp end of a javelin, symbolizing the skewering or cutting out of dubious matter. Three variants of obelus glyphs The obelus is believed to have been invented by the Homeric scholar Zenodotus as one of a system of editorial symbols. They marked questionable or corrupt words or passages in manuscripts of the Homeric epics. The system was further refined by his student Aristophanes of Byzantium, who first introduced the asterisk and used a symbol resembling a for an obelus; and finally by Aristophanes' student, in turn, Aristarchus, from whom they earned the name of \\"Aristarchian symbols\\". While the asterisk (asteriscus) was used for corrective additions, the obelus was used for corrective deletions of invalid reconstructions. It was used when non-attested words are reconstructed for the sake of argument only, implying that the author did not believe such a word or word form had ever existed. Some scholars used the obelus and various other critical symbols, in conjunction with a second symbol known as the metobelos (\\"end of obelus\\"), variously represented as two vertically arranged dots, a -like symbol, a mallet-like symbol, or a diagonal slash (with or without one or two dots). They indicated the end of a marked passage. It was used much in the same way by later scholars to mark differences between various translations or versions of the Bible and other manuscripts. The early Christian Alexandrian scholar Origen (c. 184‚Äì253 AD) used it to indicate differences between different versions of the Old Testament in his Hexapla. Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310‚Äì320 ‚Äì 403) used both a horizontal slash or hook (with or without dots) and an upright and slightly slanting dagger to represent an obelus. St. Jerome (c. 347‚Äì420) used a simple horizontal slash for an obelus, but only for passages in the Old Testament. He describes the use of the asterisk and the dagger as: \\"an asterisk makes a light shine, the obelisk cuts and pierces\\". Isidore of Seville (c. 560‚Äì636) described the use of the symbol as follows: \\"The obelus is appended to words or phrases uselessly repeated, or else where the passage involves a false reading, so that, like the arrow, it lays low the superfluous and makes the errors disappear ... The obelus accompanied by points is used when we do not know whether a passage should be suppressed or not.\\" Medieval scribes used the symbols extensively for critical markings of manuscripts. In addition to this, the dagger was also used in notations in early Christianity, to indicate a minor intermediate pause in the chanting of Psalms, equivalent to the quaver rest notation or the trope symbol in Hebrew cantillation. It also indicates a breath mark when reciting, along with the asterisk, and is thus frequently seen beside a comma. In the 16th century, the printer and scholar Robert Estienne (also known as Stephanus in Latin and Stephens in English) used it to mark differences in the words or passages between different printed versions of the Greek New Testament (Textus Receptus). Due to the variations as to the different uses of the different forms of the obelus, there is some controversy as to which symbols can actually be considered an obelus. The symbol and its variant, the , is sometimes considered to be different from other obeli. The term 'obelus' may have referred strictly only to the horizontal slash and the dagger symbols.  Modern usage  The dagger usually indicates a footnote if an asterisk has already been used. A third footnote employs the double dagger. Additional footnotes are somewhat inconsistent and represented by a variety of symbols, e.g., parallels ( ), section sign , and the pilcrow some of which were nonexistent in early modern typography. Partly because of this, superscript numerals have increasingly been used in modern literature in the place of these symbols, especially when several footnotes are required. Some texts use asterisks and daggers alongside superscripts, using the former for per-page footnotes and the latter for endnotes. The dagger is also used to indicate death, extinction, or obsolescence. The asterisk and the dagger, when placed beside years, indicate year of birth and year of death respectively. This usage is particularly common in German. When placed immediately before or after a person's name, the dagger indicates that the person is deceased. In this usage, it is referred to as the \\"death dagger\\". In the Oxford English Dictionary, the dagger symbol indicates an obsolete word. The dagger should not be confused with the Unicode characters \\"Latin cross\\" (‚úù, U+271D), \\"box drawings light vertical and horizontal\\" (, U+253C), and other cross symbols.

Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, poor appetite, and feeling generally unwell. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid salivary glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after seven to 10 days. Symptoms are often more severe in adults than in children. About a third of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include meningitis (15%), pancreatitis (4%), inflammation of the heart, permanent deafness, and testicular inflammation, which uncommonly results in infertility. Women may develop ovarian swelling, but this does not increase the risk of infertility. Mumps is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among people living in close quarters. The virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Only humans get and spread the disease. People are infectious from about seven days before onset of parotid inflammation to about 8 days after. Once an infection has run its course, a person is typically immune for life. Reinfection is possible, but the ensuing infection tends to be mild. Diagnosis is usually suspected due to parotid swelling and can be confirmed by isolating the virus on a swab of the parotid duct. Testing for IgM antibodies in the blood is simple and may be useful; however, it can be falsely negative in those who have been immunized. Mumps is preventable by two doses of the mumps vaccine. Most of the developed world includes it in their immunization programs, often in combination with measles, rubella, and varicella vaccine. Countries that have low immunization rates may see an increase in cases among older age groups and thus worse outcomes. No specific treatment is known. Efforts involve controlling symptoms with pain medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Intravenous immunoglobulin may be useful in certain complications. Hospitalization may be required if meningitis or pancreatitis develops. About one in 10,000 people who are infected die. Without immunization, about 0.1 to 1.0% of the population is affected per year. Widespread vaccination has resulted in a more than 90% decline in rates of disease. Mumps is more common in the developing world, where vaccination is less common. Outbreaks, however, may still occur in a vaccinated population. Before the introduction of a vaccine, mumps was a common childhood disease worldwide. Larger outbreaks of disease typically occurred every two to five years. Children between the ages of five and nine were most commonly affected. Among immunized populations, those in their early 20s often are affected. Around the equator, it often occurs all year round, while in the more northerly and southerly regions of the world, it is more common in the winter and spring. Painful swelling of the parotid glands and testicles was described by Hippocrates in the fifth century BCE.  Signs and symptoms  Mumps is usually preceded by a set of prodromal symptoms, including low-grade fever, headache, and feeling generally unwell. This is followed by progressive swelling of one or both parotid glands. Parotid gland swelling usually lasts about a week. Other symptoms of mumps can include dry mouth, sore face and/or ears, and difficulty speaking.  Complications  * Painful testicular inflammation develops in 15‚Äì40% of men who have completed puberty and contract the mumps virus. This testicular inflammation is generally one-sided (both testicles are swollen in 15‚Äì30% of mumps orchitis cases) and typically occurs about 10 days after the parotid gland becomes inflamed. Testicular swelling has been documented as late as 6 weeks after parotid-gland swelling. Decreased fertility is an uncommon consequence of testicular inflammation from mumps and infertility is rare. * Studies have reached differing conclusions regarding whether infection with the mumps virus during pregnancy leads to an increased rate of spontaneous abortion. * Before vaccination, about 10% of cases of aseptic meningitis were due to mumps. The symptoms generally resolve within 10 days. Infection of the brain itself (encephalitis) occurs in between 0.02 and 0.3% of cases. * Ovarian inflammation occurs in about 5% percent of adolescent and adult females. * Deafness is one of the most serious complications of mumps and occurs in 4% of cases. Profound (91 decibel or more) but rare sensorineural hearing loss can occur, which can affect one or both ears. Deafness affecting only one ear occurs in about 0.005% of cases. * Acute pancreatic inflammation occurs in about 4% of cases, manifesting as abdominal pain and vomiting. * Brain inflammation is very rare, and fatal in about 1% of the cases when it occurs.  Cause  The mumps virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, linear negative- sense RNA virus of the genus Orthorubulavirus and family Paramyxovirus. The genome consists of 15,384 bases encoding nine proteins. Proteins involved in viral replication are the nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and polymerase protein while the genomic RNA forms the ribonucleocapsid. Humans are the only natural host for the virus. Mumps is spread from person to person through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva from an infected person. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, the droplets aerosolize and can enter the eyes, nose, or mouth of another person. Mumps can also be spread by sharing eating utensils or cups. The virus can also survive on surfaces and then be spread after contact in a similar manner. A person infected with mumps is contagious from around 7 days before the onset of symptoms until about 8 days after symptoms start. The incubation period (time until symptoms begin) can be from 12‚Äì25 days, but is typically 16‚Äì18 days. About 20-40% of persons infected with the mumps virus do not show symptoms, so being infected and spreading the virus without knowing it is possible.  Diagnosis  During an outbreak, a diagnosis can be made by determining recent exposure and parotitis. However, when the disease incidence is low, other infectious causes of parotitis should be considered, such as HIV, coxsackievirus, and influenza. Some viruses such as enteroviruses may cause aseptic meningitis that is very clinically similar to mumps. A physical examination confirms the presence of the swollen glands. Usually, the disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and no confirmatory laboratory testing is needed. If uncertainty exists about the diagnosis, a test of saliva or blood may be carried out; a newer diagnostic confirmation, using real-time nested polymerase chain reaction technology, has also been developed. As with any inflammation of the salivary glands, the serum level of the enzyme amylase is often elevated.Amylase: The Test , Lab Tests Online UK  Prevention  The most common preventive measure against mumps is a vaccination with a mumps vaccine, developed by American microbiologist Maurice Hilleman at Merck. The vaccine may be given separately or as part of the MMR vaccine or MMRV vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of mumps vaccines in all countries with well- functioning childhood vaccination programmes. In the United Kingdom, they are routinely given to children at age 13 months with a booster at 3‚Äì5 years (preschool). The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the routine administration of MMR vaccine at ages 12‚Äì15 months and at 4‚Äì6 years. In some locations, the vaccine is given again between 4 and 6 years of age, or between 11 and 12 years of age if not previously given. The efficacy of the vaccine depends on its strain, but is usually around 80%. The Jeryl Lynn strain is most commonly used in developed countries, but has been shown to have reduced efficacy in epidemic situations. The Leningrad-Zagreb strain commonly used in developing countries appears to have superior efficacy in epidemic situations. Because of the outbreaks within college and university settings, many governments have established vaccination programs to prevent large-scale outbreaks. In Canada, provincial governments and the Public Health Agency of Canada have all participated in awareness campaigns to encourage students ranging from grade one to college and university to get vaccinated.Table 2: Provincial and Territorial recommendations for mumps-containing immunization, 2007 , Information on Outbreaks of Mumps In Canada ‚Äì Information for Health Professionals, Public Health Agency Canada The WHO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the British Medical Association, and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain recommend routine vaccination of children against mumps. General mumps vaccination with MMR began in the United Kingdom in 1988. Before the introduction of the mumps vaccine, the mumps virus was the leading cause of viral meningoencephalitis in the United States. However, encephalitis occurs rarely (less than two per 100,000). In one of the largest studies in the literature, the most common symptoms of mumps meningoencephalitis were found to be fever (97%), vomiting (94%), and headache (88.8%). The mumps vaccine was introduced into the United States in December 1967: since its introduction, a steady decrease in the incidence of mumps has occurred, with 151,209 cases of mumps reported in 1968. From 2001 to 2008, the case average was only 265 per year, excluding an outbreak of less than 6000 cases in 2006 attributed largely to university contagion in young adults.  Management  The treatment of mumps is supportive. Symptoms may be relieved by the application of intermittent ice or heat to the affected neck/testicular area and by acetaminophen for pain relief. Warm saltwater gargles, soft foods, and extra fluids may also help relieve symptoms. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is not used to treat children due to the risk of Reye syndrome. No effective postexposure recommendation is made to prevent secondary transmission, nor is the postexposure use of vaccine or immunoglobulin effective. Also, no available evidence regarding the Chinese herbal medicine. Mumps is considered most contagious in the 5 days after the onset of symptoms, and isolation is recommended during this period. In someone who has been admitted to the hospital, standard and droplet precautions are needed. People who work in healthcare cannot work for 5 days.  Epidemiology  In the United States, typically between a few hundred and few thousand cases occur in a year. History Mumps has been known to humans since antiquity. It was mentioned by Hippocrates in his Of the Epidemics written in 400 BC, wherein he described the painful swelling of the parotid glands and testicles. The disease was first described scientifically as late as 1790 by a British physician Robert Hamilton (1721‚Äì1793) in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The disease was one of the most medically significant diseases among the armies involved in the fighting both World War I and World War II. A number of attempts to prove that mumps is contagious failed. Its contagiousness was finally proved in 1934 by Claude D. Johnson and Ernest William Goodpasture (1886‚Äì1960), who demonstrated that mumps was transmitted by a filterable virus.

According to all four canonical gospels, Judas betrayed Jesus to the Sanhedrin in the Garden of Gethsemane by kissing him and addressing him as \\"rabbi\\" to reveal his identity to the crowd who had come to arrest him., , , , , , , His name is often used synonymously with betrayal or treason. Judas's epithet Iscariot most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth, but this explanation is not universally accepted and many other possibilities have been suggested. The Gospel of Mark, the earliest gospel, gives no motive for Judas's betrayal, but does present Jesus predicting it at the Last Supper, an event also described in all the later gospels. The Gospel of Matthew states that Judas committed the betrayal in exchange for thirty pieces of silver. The Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John suggest that he was possessed by Satan. According to , after learning that Jesus was to be crucified, Judas attempted to return the money he had been paid for his betrayal to the chief priests and committed suicide by hanging. The priests used the money to buy a field to bury strangers in, which was called the \\"Field of Blood\\" because it had been bought with blood money. The Book of Acts quotes Peter as saying that Judas used the money to buy the field himself and, he \\"[fell] headlong... burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.\\" His place among the Twelve Apostles was later filled by Matthias. Due to his notorious role in all the gospel narratives, Judas remains a controversial figure in Christian history. For instance, Judas's betrayal is seen as setting in motion the events that led to Jesus's crucifixion and resurrection, which, according to traditional Christian theology, brought salvation to humanity. The Gnostic Gospel of Judas‚Äîrejected by the proto-orthodox Church as heretical‚Äîportrays Judas's actions as done in obedience to instructions given to him by Jesus, and that he alone amongst the disciples knew Jesus's true teachings. Since the Middle Ages, Judas has sometimes been portrayed as a personification of the Jewish people and his betrayal has been used to justify Christian antisemitism. Historicity Although Judas Iscariot's historical existence is generally widely accepted among secular historians, this relative consensus has not gone entirely unchallenged. The earliest possible allusion to Judas comes from the First Epistle to the Corinthians , in which Paul the Apostle does not mention Judas by name, but uses the passive voice of the Greek word parad√≠d≈çmi (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒØŒ¥œâŒºŒπ), which most Bible translations render as \\"was betrayed\\": \\"...the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread...\\" Nonetheless, many biblical scholars argue that the word parad√≠d≈çmi should be translated as \\"was handed over\\". This translation could still refer to Judas, but it could also instead refer to God metaphorically \\"handing Jesus over\\" to the Romans. In his book Antisemitism and Modernity (2006), the Jewish scholar Hyam Maccoby suggests that, in the New Testament, the name \\"Judas\\" was constructed as an attack on the Judaeans or on the Judaean religious establishment held responsible for executing Jesus. In his book The Sins of Scripture (2009), John Shelby Spong concurs with this argument, insisting, \\"The whole story of Judas has the feeling of being contrived ... The act of betrayal by a member of the twelve disciples is not found in the earliest Christian writings. Judas is first placed into the Christian story by the Gospel of Mark (), who wrote in the early years of the eighth decade of the Common Era.\\" Most scholars reject these arguments for non-historicity, noting that there is nothing in the gospels to associate Judas with Judeans except his name, which was an extremely common one for Jewish men during the first century, and that numerous other figures named \\"Judas\\" are mentioned throughout the New Testament, none of whom are portrayed negatively. Positive figures named Judas mentioned in the New Testament include the prophet Judas Barsabbas (Acts 15:22‚Äì33), Jesus's brother Jude (Mark 6:3; Matt 13:55; Jude 1), and the apostle Judas the son of James (Luke 6:14‚Äì16; Acts 1:13; John 14:22). B. J. Oropeza argues that Christians should not repeat the historic tragedy of associating Judas Iscariot with the Judeans but regard him instead as an emergent Christian apostate, and hence, one of their own. His betrayal over a sum of money warns auditors against the vice of greed. Life Name and background Judas Iscariot (between 1886 and 1894) by James Tissot The name Judas (·øöŒøœçŒ¥Œ±œÇ) is a Greek rendering of the Hebrew name Judah (◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î, Yeh√ªd√¢h, Hebrew for \\"God is thanked\\"), which was an extremely common name for Jewish men during the first century AD, due to the renowned hero Judas Maccabeus. Consequently, numerous other figures with this name are mentioned throughout the New Testament. In the Gospel of Mark , the earliest of all the gospels, which was written in the mid 60s or early 70s AD, Judas Iscariot is the only apostle named Judas. follows this portrayal. The Gospel of Luke , however, replaces the apostle whom Mark and Matthew call \\"Thaddeus\\" with \\"Judas son of James\\". Peter Stanford suggests that this renaming may represent an effort by the author of the Gospel of Luke to create a \\"good Judas\\" in contrast to the betrayer Judas Iscariot. Judas's epithet Iscariot (·øöœÉŒ∫Œ¨œÅŒπœâŒ∏ or ·øöœÉŒ∫Œ±œÅŒπœéœÑŒ∑œÇ), which distinguishes him from the other people named Judas in the gospels, is usually thought to be a Greek rendering of the Hebrew phrase ◊ê◊ô◊©÷æ◊ß◊®◊ô◊ï◊™, (√é≈°- Qr√Æy√¥t), meaning \\"the man from Kerioth\\". This interpretation is supported by the statement in the Gospel of John that Judas was \\"the son of Simon Iscariot\\". Nonetheless, this interpretation of the name is not fully accepted by all scholars. One of the most popular alternative explanations holds that Iscariot (‹£‹ü‹™‹ù‹ò‹õ‹ê 'Skaryota' in Syriac Aramaic, per the Peshitta text) may be a corruption of the Latin word sicarius, meaning \\"dagger man\\",; Sedro-Woolley, Wash.: Netzari Press, 2012), 278fn177. which referred to a member of the Sicarii (◊°◊ô◊ß◊®◊ô◊ô◊ù in Aramaic), a group of Jewish rebels who were known for committing acts of terrorism in the 40s and 50s AD by assassinating people in crowds using long knives hidden under their cloaks. This interpretation is problematic, however, because there is nothing in the gospels to associate Judas with the Sicarii, and there is no evidence that the cadre existed during the 30s AD when Judas was alive.Brown, Raymond E. (1994). The Death of the Messiah: From Gethsemane to the Grave: A Commentary on the Passion Narratives in the Four Gospels v.1 pp. 688‚Äì92. New York: Doubleday/The Anchor Bible Reference Library. ; Meier, John P. A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus (2001). v. 3, p. 210. New York: Doubleday/The Anchor Bible Reference Library. . A possibility advanced by Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg is that Iscariot means \\"the liar\\" or \\"the false one,\\" perhaps from the Aramaic ◊ê÷¥◊©÷∞◊Å◊ß÷∑◊®÷∞◊ô÷∏◊ê. Stanford rejects this, noting that the gospel-writers follow Judas's name with the statement that he betrayed Jesus, so it would be redundant for them to call him \\"the false one\\" before immediately stating that he was a traitor. Some have proposed that the word derives from an Aramaic word meaning \\"red color,\\" from the root ◊°◊ß◊®. Another hypothesis holds that the word derives from one of the Aramaic roots ◊°◊õ◊® or ◊°◊í◊®. This would mean \\"to deliver,\\" based on the LXX rendering of Isaiah 19:4‚Äîa theory advanced by J. Alfred Morin. The epithet could also be associated with the manner of Judas's death, i.e., hanging. This would mean Iscariot derives from a kind of Greek- Aramaic hybrid: ◊ê÷¥◊°÷∞◊õ÷∑÷º◊®÷∞◊ô◊ï÷º◊™÷∏◊ê, Iskarioutha, \\"chokiness\\" or \\"constriction.\\" This might indicate that the epithet was applied posthumously by the remaining disciples, but Joan E. Taylor has argued that it was a descriptive name given to Judas by Jesus, since other disciples such as Simon Peter/Cephas (Kephas \\"rock\\") were also given such names. Role as an apostle Calling of the Apostles (1481) by Domenico Ghirlandaio Although the canonical gospels frequently disagree on the names of some of the minor apostles, all four of them list Judas Iscariot as one of them. The Synoptic Gospels state that Jesus sent out \\"the twelve\\" (including Judas) with power over unclean spirits and with a ministry of preaching and healing: Judas clearly played an active part in this apostolic ministry alongside the other eleven.See Mark 6:6; Matthew 10:5‚Äì10; and Luke 9:1 However, in John's Gospel, Judas's outlook was differentiated‚Äîmany of Jesus' disciples abandoned him because of the difficulty of accepting his teachings, and Jesus asked the twelve if they would also leave him. Simon Peter spoke for the twelve: \\"Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,\\" but Jesus observed then that despite the fact that he himself had chosen the twelve, one of them (unnamed by Jesus, but identified by the narrator) was \\"a devil\\" who would betray him.John 6:67‚Äì71 One of the best-attested and most reliable statements made by Jesus in the gospels comes from the Gospel of Matthew , in which Jesus tells his apostles: \\"in the new world, when the Son of Man shall sit on his glorious throne, you will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\\" New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman concludes, \\"This is not a tradition that was likely to have been made up by a Christian later, after Jesus's death‚Äîsince one of these twelve had abandoned his cause and betrayed him. No one thought that Judas Iscariot would be seated on a glorious throne in the Kingdom of God. That saying, therefore appears to go back to Jesus, and indicates, then, that he had twelve close disciples, whom he predicted would reign in the coming Kingdom.\\" A 16th century fresco depicting Judas being paid the 30 pieces of silver Matthew directly states that Judas betrayed Jesus for a bribe of \\"thirty pieces of silver\\"These \\"pieces of silver\\" were most likely intended to be understood as silver Tyrian shekels. by identifying him with a kiss‚Äî\\"the kiss of Judas\\"‚Äîto arresting soldiers of the High Priest Caiaphas, who then turned Jesus over to Pontius Pilate's soldiers. Mark's Gospel states that the chief priests were looking for a way to arrest Jesus. They decided not to do so during the feast [of the Passover], since they were afraid that people would riot;Mark 14:1‚Äì2 instead, they chose the night before the feast to arrest him. According to Luke's account, Satan entered Judas at this time. According to the account in the Gospel of John, Judas carried the disciples' money bag or box (, gl≈çssokomon),and but John's Gospel makes no mention of the thirty pieces of silver as a fee for betrayal. The evangelist comments in John 12:5‚Äì6 that Judas spoke fine words about giving money to the poor, but the reality was \\"not that he cared for the poor, but [that] he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.\\" However, in John 13:27‚Äì30, when Judas left the gathering of Jesus and his disciples with betrayal in mind,John 13:2, Jerusalem Bible translation some [of the disciples] thought that Judas might have been leaving to buy supplies or on a charitable errand. Ehrman argues that Judas's betrayal \\"is about as historically certain as anything else in the tradition\\", pointing out that the betrayal is independently attested in the Gospel of Mark, in the Gospel of John, and in the Book of Acts. Ehrman also contends that it is highly unlikely that early Christians would have made the story of Judas's betrayal up, since it reflects poorly on Jesus's judgement in choosing him as an apostle. Nonetheless, Ehrman argues that what Judas actually told the authorities was not Jesus's location, but rather Jesus's secret teaching that he was the Messiah. This, he holds, explains why the authorities did not try to arrest Jesus prior to Judas's betrayal. John P. Meier sums up the historical consensus, stating, \\"We only know two basic facts about [Judas]: (1) Jesus chose him as one of the Twelve, and (2) he handed over Jesus to the Jerusalem authorities, thus precipitating Jesus' execution.\\" Death 16th-century fresco from Tarzhishte Monastery, Strupets, Bulgaria, showing Judas hanging himself as described in Many different accounts of Judas' death have survived from antiquity, both within and outside the New Testament. states that, after learning that Jesus was to be crucified, Judas was overcome by remorse and attempted to return the 30 pieces of silver to the priests, but they would not accept them because they were blood money, so he threw them on the ground and left. Afterwards, he committed suicide by hanging himself. The priests used the money to buy a potter's field, which became known as Akeldama (◊ó◊ß◊ú ◊ì◊û◊ê ‚Äì khakel dama) ‚Äì the Field of Blood ‚Äì because it had been bought with blood money. states that Judas used the money to buy a field, and \\"[fell] headlong... burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.\\" The field became known as Akeldama, which means \\"the Field of Blood\\" in Aramaic, because it was covered in Judas's blood, and it was used to bury strangers. In this account, Judas' death is apparently by accident and he shows no signs of remorse. The early Church Father Papias of Hierapolis ( 60‚Äì130 AD) recorded in his Expositions of the Sayings of the Lord, which was probably written during the first decade of the second century AD, that Judas was afflicted by God's wrath; his body became so enormously bloated that he could not pass through a street with buildings on either side. His face became so swelled up that a doctor could not even identify the location of his eyes using an optical instrument. Judas' genitals became enormously swollen and oozed with pus and worms. Finally, he killed himself on his own land by pouring out his innards onto the ground, which stank so horribly that, even in Papias' own time a century later, people still could not pass the site without holding their noses. This story was well known among Christians in antiquity and was often told in competition with the two conflicting stories from the New Testament. According to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, which was probably written in the fourth century AD, Judas was overcome with remorse and went home to tell his wife, who was roasting a chicken on a spit over a charcoal fire, that he was going to kill himself, because he knew Jesus would rise from the dead and, when he did, he would punish him. Judas's wife laughed and told him that Jesus could no more rise from the dead than he could resurrect the chicken she was cooking. Immediately, the chicken was restored to life and began to crow. Judas then ran away and hanged himself. In the apocryphal Gospel of Judas, Judas has a vision of the disciples stoning and persecuting him.Gospel of Judas 44‚Äì45 The discrepancy between the two different accounts of Judas's death in and has proven to be a serious challenge to those who support the idea of Biblical inerrancy. This problem was one of the points leading C. S. Lewis, for example, to reject the view \\"that every statement in Scripture must be historical truth\\".Letter to Clyde S. Kilby, 7 May 1959, quoted in Michael J. Christensen, C. S. Lewis on Scripture, Abingdon, 1979, Appendix A. Nonetheless, various attempts at harmonization have been suggested. Generally they have followed literal interpretations such as that of Augustine of Hippo, which suggest that these simply describe different aspects of the same event‚Äîthat Judas hanged himself in the field, and the rope eventually snapped and the fall burst his body open, or that the accounts of Acts and Matthew refer to two different transactions. Some have taken the descriptions as figurative: that the \\"falling prostrate\\" was Judas in anguish, and the \\"bursting out of the bowels\\" is pouring out emotion. Modern scholars reject these approaches.Raymond E. Brown, An Introduction to the New Testament, p. 114.Charles Talbert, Reading Acts: A Literary and Theological Commentary, Smyth & Helwys (2005) p. 15.Frederick Dale Bruner, Matthew: A Commentary, Eerdmans (2004), p. 703. Arie W. Zwiep states that \\"neither story was meant to be read in light of the other\\" and that \\"the integrity of both stories as complete narratives in themselves is seriously disrespected when the two separate stories are being conflated into a third, harmonized version.\\" David A. Reed argues that the Matthew account is a midrashic exposition that allows the author to present the event as a fulfillment of prophetic passages from the Old Testament. They argue that the author adds imaginative details such as the thirty pieces of silver, and the fact that Judas hangs himself, to an earlier tradition about Judas's death. Matthew's description of the death as fulfilment of a prophecy \\"spoken through Jeremiah the prophet\\" has caused difficulties, since it does not clearly correspond to any known version of the Book of Jeremiah but does appear to refer to a story from the Book of Zechariah which describes the return of a payment of thirty pieces of silver.Vincent P. Branick, Understanding the New Testament and Its Message, (Paulist Press, 1998), pp. 126‚Äì28. Even writers such as Jerome and John Calvin concluded that this was obviously an error. Modern scholars however have usually explained apparent discrepancies of this sort as arising from a Jewish practice of citing the Major Prophet in a scroll group to refer to the whole content of the scroll group, including books written by minor prophets placed in the grouping.James R. White, The King James Only Controversy, Bethany House Publishers (2009) pp. 213‚Äì15, 316. More recently, scholars have suggested that the Gospel writer may also have had a passage from Jeremiah in mind,Donald Senior, The Passion of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Liturgical Press, 1985), pp. 107‚Äì08; Anthony Cane, The Place of Judas Iscariot in Christology (Ashgate Publishing, 2005), p. 50. such as chapters and which refer to a potter's jar and a burial place, and chapter which refers to a burial place and an earthenware jar. Raymond Brown suggested, \\"the most plausible [explanation] is that Matthew 27:9‚Äì10 is presenting a mixed citation with words taken both from Zechariah and Jeremiah, and ... he refers to that combination by one name. Jeremiah 18‚Äì9 concerns a potter (18:2‚Äì; 19:1), a purchase (19:1), the Valley of Hinnom (where the Field of Blood is traditionally located, 19:2), 'innocent blood' (19:4), and the renaming of a place for burial (19:6, 11); and Jer 32:6‚Äì5 tells of the purchase of a field with silver.\\" Randel Helms gives this as an example of the 'fictional and imaginative' use by early Christians of the Old Testament: \\"Matthew's source has blended Jeremiah's buying of a field and placing the deed in a pot with Zechariah's casting of 30 pieces of silver down in the temple and the purchase of the Potter's Field.\\" Theology Betrayal of Jesus The Betrayal Peter raises his sword; Judas hangs himself. Illumination from a western manuscript, 1504 The Kiss of Judas Iscariot, coloured engraving, 15th century. There are several explanations as to why Judas betrayed Jesus. In the earliest account, in the Gospel of Mark, when he goes to the chief priests to betray Jesus, he is offered money as a reward, but it is not clear that money is his motivation.() In the Gospel of Matthew account, on the other hand, he asks what they will pay him for handing Jesus over.() In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, the devil enters into Judas, causing him to offer to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John account has Judas complaining that money has been spent on expensive perfumes to anoint Jesus which could have been spent on the poor, but adds that he was the keeper of the apostles' purse and used to steal from it. One suggestion has been that Judas expected Jesus to overthrow Roman rule of Judea. In this view, Judas is a disillusioned disciple betraying Jesus not so much because he loved money, but because he loved his country and thought Jesus had failed it. Another is that Jesus was causing unrest likely to increase tensions with the Roman authorities and they thought he should be restrained until after the Passover, when everyone had gone back home and the commotion had died down. The Gospels suggest that Jesus foresaw (, ) and allowed Judas' betrayal (). One explanation is that Jesus allowed the betrayal because it would allow God's plan to be fulfilled. Another is that regardless of the betrayal, Jesus was ultimately destined for crucifixion.Did Judas betray Jesus Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, April 2006 In April 2006, a Coptic papyrus manuscript titled the Gospel of Judas from 200 AD was translated, suggesting that Jesus told Judas to betray him, although some scholars question the translation. Judas is the subject of philosophical writings. Origen of Alexandria, in his Commentary on John's Gospel, reflected on Judas's interactions with the other apostles and Jesus' confidence in him prior to his betrayal. Other philosophical reflections on Judas include The Problem of Natural Evil by Bertrand Russell and \\"Three Versions of Judas,\\" a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. They allege various problematic ideological contradictions with the discrepancy between Judas' actions and his eternal punishment. Bruce Reichenbach argues that if Jesus foresees Judas' betrayal, then the betrayal is not an act of free will, and therefore should not be punishable. Conversely, it is argued that just because the betrayal was foretold, it does not prevent Judas from exercising his own free will in this matter. Other scholars argue that Judas acted in obedience to God's will. The gospels suggest that Judas is apparently bound up with the fulfillment of God's purposes (, , , , , , ), yet \\"woe is upon him\\", and he would \\"have been better unborn\\" (). The difficulty inherent in the saying is its paradox: if Judas had not been born, the Son of Man would apparently no longer do \\"as it is written of him.\\" The consequence of this apologetic approach is that Judas' actions come to be seen as necessary and unavoidable, yet leading to condemnation. Another explanation is that Judas' birth and betrayal did not necessitate the only way the Son of Man could have suffered and been crucified. The earliest churches believed \\"as it is written of him\\" to be prophetic, fulfilling Scriptures such as that of the suffering servant in Isaiah 52‚Äì53 and the righteous one in Psalm 22, which do not require betrayal (at least by Judas) as the means to the suffering. Regardless of any necessity, Judas is held responsible for his act (Mark 14:21; Luke 22:22; Matt 26:24). Erasmus believed that Judas was free to change his intention, but Martin Luther argued in rebuttal that Judas' will was immutable. John Calvin states that Judas was predestined to damnation, but writes on the question of Judas' guilt: \\"surely in Judas' betrayal, it will be no more right, because God himself willed that his son be delivered up and delivered him up to death, to ascribe the guilt of the crime to God than to transfer the credit for redemption to Judas.\\" The Catholic Church has no view on his damnation. The Vatican only proclaims individuals' Eternal Salvation through the Canon of Saints. There is no 'Canon of the Damned', nor any official proclamation of the damnation of Judas. It is speculated that Judas's damnation, which seems possible from the Gospels' text, may not stem from his betrayal of Christ, but from the despair which caused him to subsequently commit suicide. In his book The Passover Plot (1965), British New Testament scholar Hugh J. Schonfield suggested that the crucifixion of Christ was a conscious re-enactment of Biblical prophecy and that Judas acted with the full knowledge and consent of Jesus in \\"betraying\\" him to the authorities. The book has been variously described as 'factually groundless', based on 'little data' and 'wild suppositions', 'disturbing' and 'tawdry'.Susan Gubar, Judas: A Biography (W. W. Norton & Company, 2009) pp. 298‚Äì99 (referring to several books, including this one). In his 1970 book Theologie der Drei Tage (English translation: Mysterium Paschale), Hans Urs von Balthasar emphasizes that Jesus was not betrayed but surrendered and delivered up by himself, since the meaning of the Greek word used by the New Testament, paradidonai (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒπŒ¥œåŒΩŒ±Œπ, ), is unequivocally \\"handing over of self\\". In the \\"Preface to the Second Edition\\", Balthasar takes a cue from Revelation See occurrences on Google Books. (Vulgate: agni qui occisus est ab origine mundi, NIV: \\"the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world\\") to extrapolate the idea that God as \\"immanent Trinity\\" can endure and conquer godlessness, abandonment, and death in an \\"eternal super-kenosis\\".Hans Urs von Balthasar (2000) [1990] Preface to the Second Edition. Role in apocrypha Judas has been a figure of great interest to esoteric groups, such as many Gnostic sects. Irenaeus records the beliefs of one Gnostic sect, the Cainites, who believed that Judas was an instrument of the Sophia, Divine Wisdom, thus earning the hatred of the Demiurge. His betrayal of Jesus thus was a victory over the materialist world. The Cainites later split into two groups, disagreeing over the ultimate significance of Jesus in their cosmology. The Syriac Infancy Gospel The Syriac Infancy Gospelhttp://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0806.htm/ borrows from some the different versions of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. However, it adds many of its own tales, probably from local legends, including one of Judas. This pseudepigraphic work tells how Judas, as a boy, was possessed by Satan, who caused him to bite himself or anyone else present. In one of these attacks, Judas bit the young Jesus in the side; and, by touching Him, Satan was exorcised. It further states that the side which Judas supposedly bit was the same side that was pierced by the Holy Lance at the Crucifixion.John 19:31‚Äì37 Gospel of Judas First page of the Gospel of Judas (Page 33 of Codex Tchacos) During the 1970s, a Coptic papyrus codex (book) was discovered near Beni Masah, Egypt. It appeared to be a 3rd- or 4th-century-AD copy of a 2nd-century original,Timeline of early Christianity at National Geographic\\"Judas 'helped Jesus save mankind' \\" BBC News, 7 May 2006 (following National Geographic publication) relating a series of conversations in which Jesus and Judas interact and discuss the nature of the universe from a Gnostic viewpoint. The discovery was given dramatic international exposure in April 2006 when the US National Geographic magazine published a feature article entitled \\"The Gospel of Judas\\" with images of the fragile codex and analytical commentary by relevant experts and interested observers (but not a comprehensive translation). The article's introduction stated: \\"An ancient text lost for 1,700 years says Christ's betrayer was his truest disciple.\\"Cockburn A \\"The Gospel of Judas \\" National Geographic (USA) May 2006 The article points to some evidence that the original document was extant in the 2nd century: \\"Around A.D. 180, Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in what was then Roman Gaul, wrote a massive treatise called Against Heresies [in which he attacked] a 'fictitious history,' which 'they style the Gospel of Judas.'\\"Cockburn A at p. 3 Before the magazine's edition was circulated, other news media gave exposure to the story, abridging and selectively reporting it. In December 2007, a New York Times op-ed article by April DeConick asserted that the National Geographics translation is badly flawed: For example, in one instance the National Geographic transcription refers to Judas as a \\"daimon,\\" which the society's experts have translated as \\"spirit.\\" However, the universally accepted word for \\"spirit\\" is \\"pneuma\\"‚Äîin Gnostic literature \\"daimon\\" is always taken to mean \\"demon.\\"Deconick A D \\"Gospel Truth \\" New York Times 1 December 2007 The National Geographic Society responded that \\"Virtually all issues April D. DeConick raises about translation choices are addressed in footnotes in both the popular and critical editions.\\"Statement from National Geographic in Response to April DeConick's New York Times Op-Ed \\"Gospel Truth\\" In a later review of the issues and relevant publications, critic Joan Acocella questioned whether ulterior intentions had not begun to supersede historical analysis, e.g., whether publication of The Gospel of Judas could be an attempt to roll back ancient anti-semitic imputations. She concluded that the ongoing clash between scriptural fundamentalism and attempts at revision were childish because of the unreliability of the sources. Therefore, she argued, \\"People interpret, and cheat. The answer is not to fix the Bible but to fix ourselves.\\"Acocella J. \\"Betrayal: Should we hate Judas Iscariot? \\" The New Yorker 3 August 2009 Other scholars have questioned the initial translation and interpretation of the Gospel of Judas by the National Geographic team of experts. Gospel of Barnabas According to medieval copies (the earliest copies from the 15th century) of the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas's appearance was transformed to that of Jesus', when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then was ascended to the heavens. This transformation of appearance was so identical that the masses, followers of Christ, and even the Mother of Jesus, Mary, initially thought that the one arrested and crucified was Jesus himself. The gospel then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas' body was stolen from his grave, and then the rumors spread of Jesus being risen from the dead. When Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened, he prayed to God to be sent back to the earth, and descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers, and told them the truth of what happened. He then ascended back to the heavens, and will come back at the end of times as a just king. This Gospel is considered by the majority of Christians to be late and pseudepigraphical; however, some academics suggest that it may contain some remnants of an earlier apocryphal work (perhaps Gnostic, Ebionite or Diatessaronic), redacted to bring it more in line with Islamic doctrine. Some Muslims consider the surviving versions as transmitting a suppressed apostolic original. Some Islamic organizations cite it in support of the Islamic view of Jesus. Representations and symbolism a kiss in a Spanish paso figure. The term Judas has entered many languages as a synonym for betrayer, and Judas has become the archetype of the traitor in Western art and literature. Judas is given some role in virtually all literature telling the Passion story, and appears in numerous modern novels and movies. In the Eastern Orthodox hymns of Holy Wednesday (the Wednesday before Pascha), Judas is contrasted with the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume and washed his feet with her tears. According to the Gospel of John, Judas protested at this apparent extravagance, suggesting that the money spent on it should have been given to the poor. After this, Judas went to the chief priests and offered to betray Jesus for money. The hymns of Holy Wednesday contrast these two figures, encouraging believers to avoid the example of the fallen disciple and instead to imitate Mary's example of repentance. Also, Wednesday is observed as a day of fasting from meat, dairy products, and olive oil throughout the year in memory of the betrayal of Judas. The prayers of preparation for receiving the Eucharist also make mention of Judas's betrayal: \\"I will not reveal your mysteries to your enemies, neither like Judas will I betray you with a kiss, but like the thief on the cross I will confess you.\\" Judas Iscariot is often shown with red hair in Spanish culturepelo de Judas (\\"Judas hair\\") in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola.Page 314 of article Red Hair from Bentley's Miscellany, July 1851.

Robert Nares, James Orchard Halliwell- Phillipps, Thomas Wright. J. R. Smith, 1859 The practice is comparable to the Renaissance portrayal of Jews with red hair, which was then regarded as a negative trait and which may have been used to correlate Judas Iscariot with contemporary Jews.Judas' Red Hair and The Jews, Journal of Jewish Art (9), 1982, Melinnkoff R.M In the Church of St John the Baptist, Yeovil, one stained glass window depicts Judas with a black halo. In paintings depicting the Last Supper, Judas is occasionally depicted with a dark-colored halo (contrasting with the lighter halos of the other apostles) to signify his former status as an apostle. More commonly, however, he is the only one at the table without one. In some church stained glass windows he is also depicted with a dark halo such as in one of the windows of the Church of St John the Baptist, Yeovil. Art and literature Cath√©drale Saint-Lazare, Autun. Judas hangs himself Judas is the subject of one of the oldest surviving English ballads, which dates from the 13th century. In the ballad, the blame for the betrayal of Christ is placed on his sister. In Dante's Inferno, Judas is condemned to the lowest circle of Hell: the Ninth Circle of Traitors, also known as the frozen lake, Cocytus. He is one of three sinners deemed evil enough to be doomed to an eternity of being chewed in the mouths of the triple-headed Satan (the others being Brutus and Cassius, the assassins of Julius Caesar). Dante writes that Judas‚Äîhaving committed the ultimate act of treachery by betraying the Son of God Himself‚Äîis trapped in the jaws of Satan's central head, said to be the most vicious of the three, by his head, leaving his back to be raked by the fallen angel's claws. In art, one of the most famous depictions of Judas Iscariot and his kiss of betrayal of Jesus is The Taking of Christ by Italian Baroque artist, Caravaggio, done in 1602. In Memoirs of Judas (1867) by Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, he is seen as a leader of the Jewish revolt against the rule of Romans.Baldassare Labanca, Ges√π Cristo nella letteratura contemporanea, straniera e italiana, Fratelli Bocca, 1903, p. 240 Edward Elgar's oratorio, The Apostles, depicts Judas as wanting to force Jesus to declare his divinity and establish the kingdom on earth. In Trial of Christ in Seven Stages (1909) by John Brayshaw Kaye, the author did not accept the idea that Judas intended to betray Christ, and the poem is a defence of Judas, in which he adds his own vision to the biblical account of the story of the trial before the Sanhedrin and Caiaphas.The Magazine of poetry, Volume 2, Issues 1‚Äì4 (1890) Charles Wells Moulton, Buffalo, New York In Mikhail Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margarita, Judas is paid by the high priest of Judaea to testify against Jesus, who had been inciting trouble among the people of Jerusalem. After authorizing the crucifixion, Pilate suffers an agony of regret and turns his anger on Judas, ordering him assassinated. The story within a story appears as a counter-revolutionary novel in the context of Moscow in the 1920s‚Äì1930s. \\"Tres versiones de Judas\\" (English title: \\"Three Versions of Judas\\") is a short story by Argentine writer and poet Jorge Luis Borges. It was included in Borges' anthology, Ficciones, published in 1944, and revolves around the main character's doubts about the canonical story of Judas who instead creates three alternative versions.Equinox ‚Äì Books ‚Äì Book Details On April 17, 1945, the radio program Inner Sanctum broadcast the story \\"The Judas Clock\\", in which the cursed title object, a 16th-century Italian marble longcase clock, is unable to run without the thirty silver coins of Judas being placed in its hollow weights. The episode's main character, played by Berry Kroeger, recites the fate of Judas from Matthew 27:5 (King James version) at the episode's conclusion. The 1971 novel I, Judas by Taylor Caldwell and Jess Stearn () was one of the first published novels to portray Judas in a more sympathetic light. In the 1977 television miniseries Jesus Of Nazareth, Judas was famously portrayed by Ian McShane, in a critically acclaimed performance. He is portrayed as being torn between personal loyalty to his Rabbi and social loyalty to the Sanhedrin. Ultimately he is \\"seduced\\" into betraying Jesus by the temple scribe Zerah, the fictional character who acts as the series lead villain. In Martin Scorsese's 1988 film The Last Temptation of Christ, based on the novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, Judas' only motivation in betraying Jesus to the Romans was to help him accomplish his mission by mutual agreement, making Judas the catalyst for the event later interpreted as bringing about humanity's salvation. In the film Dracula 2000, Dracula (played by Gerard Butler) is revealed in this version to be Judas. God punishes Judas, not only for betraying Jesus, but attempting suicide at dawn, by turning him into the first vampire, and making him vulnerable to silver for taking 30 pieces of silver as payment for his betrayal, and his suicide attempt at dawn also tries to explain a vampire's violent reaction to sunlight. In The Last Days of Judas Iscariot (2005), a critically acclaimed play by Stephen Adly Guirgis, Judas is given a trial in Purgatory. In C. K. Stead's 2006 novel My Name Was Judas, Judas, who was then known as Idas of Sidon, recounts the story of Jesus as recalled by him some forty years later. In September 2017, Boom Studios announced a four-issue comics Judas, written by Jeff Loveness and Jakub Rebelka. In March 2018, BBC Radio 4's 15 Minute Drama broadcast Judas, written by Lucy Gannon, in 5 episodes with Damien Molony in the title role. In the March 2018 film Mary Magdalene, written by Helen Edmundson, Judas is played by Tahar Rahim. Judas is a lead role in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Jesus Christ Superstar. The rock opera depicts Judas as somewhat of a tragic figure who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples. Various actors and singers who have played the role include: Murray Head (original concept album), Ben Vereen (original 1971 Broadway production), Carl Anderson (1973 film adaptation), Roger Daltrey (1996 BBC Radio 2 production), Zubin Varla (1996 London revival), J√©r√¥me Pradon (2000 film adaptation based on the 1996 revival), Tony Vincent (2000 Broadway revival), Corey Glover (2006 \\"new\\" A.D. tour), Tim Minchin (2012 Arena Tour), and Brandon Victor Dixon (live 2018 televised concert). In DC Comics, one of the Phantom Stranger's possible origins is that he is Judas. After his suicide, he is judged by the Circle of Eternity and is sent back to Earth as an eternal agent of God. The thirty silver pieces he received for betraying Jesus is formed into a necklace he wears, and his deeds cause pieces to fall off, bringing him closer towards redemption.

The three agents are theoretical constructs that describe the activities and interactions of the mental life of a person. In the ego psychology model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual desires; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic agent that mediates, between the instinctual desires of the id and the critical super-ego;Freud, Sigmund. The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Vol. XIX (1999) James Strachey, Gen. Ed. Freud explained that: > The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that, > normally, control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus, in > its relation to the id, [the ego] is like a man on horseback, who has to > hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that > the rider tries to do so with his own strength, while the ego uses borrowed > forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often, a rider, if he > is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide [the horse] where it > wants to go; so, in the same way, the ego is in the habit of transforming > the id's will into action, as if it were its own. The existence of the super-ego is observable in how people can view themselves as guilty and bad, shameful and weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. In The Ego and the Id (1923), Freud presents \\"the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal ‚Äî its dictatorial Thou shalt; thus, in the psychology of the ego, Freud hypothesized different levels of ego ideal or superego development with greater ideals: The earlier in the child's development, the greater the estimate of parental power; thus, when the child is in rivalry with the parental imago, the child then feels the dictatorial Thou shalt, which is the manifest power that the imago represents on four levels: (i) the auto-erotic, (ii) the narcissistic, (iii) the anal, and (iv) the phallic. Those different levels of mental development, and their relations to parental imagos, correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection; thus aggressive and destructive desires animate the myths in the fantasies and repressions of patients, in all cultures. In response to the unstructured ambiguity and conflicting uses of the term \\"the unconscious mind\\", Freud introduced the structured model of ego psychology (id, ego, super-ego) in the essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) and elaborated, refined, and made that model formal in the essay The Ego and the Id.The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought, Third Edition (1999) Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. pp. 256‚Äì257. Psychic apparatus   Id  The Id is the instinctual component of personality that is present at birth, and is the source of bodily needs and wants, emotional impulses and desires, especially aggression and the libido (sex drive).Carlson, N. R. (1999‚Äì2000) ‚ÄúPersonality‚Äù, Psychology: The Science of Behavior (Canadian ed.), p. 453. Scarborough, Ontario: Allyn and Bacon Canada. The id acts according to the pleasure principle ‚Äî the psychic force oriented to immediate gratification of impulse and desire ‚Äî defined by the avoidance of pain. Freud said that the Id is unconscious, by definition: In the id: Developmentally, the id precedes the ego; the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While \\"id\\" is in search of pleasure, \\"ego\\" emphasizes the principle of reality. Chapter of Thus the id: The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely \\"id-ridden\\", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The \\"id\\" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced. The id \\"knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual cathexes seeking discharge‚Äîthat, in our view, is all there is in the id.\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 107. It is regarded as \\"the great reservoir of libido\\",Sigmund Freud, The Ego and the Id, On Metapsychology (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 369. the instinctive drive to create‚Äîthe life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts‚Äîthe death drive which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in \\"the hypothesis of a death instinct, the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state.\\"Freud, On Metapsychology p. 380. For Freud, \\"the death instinct would thus seem to express itself‚Äîthough probably only in part‚Äîas an instinct of destruction directed against the external world and other organisms\\"Freud, On Metapsychology p. 381. through aggression. Freud considered that \\"the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well\\",Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 138. as eros or the life instincts.  Ego  The ego (Latin for \\"I\\", )Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \\"Ego\\". acts according to the reality principle; i.e., it seeks to please the id's drive in realistic ways that, in the long term, bring benefit, rather than grief. At the same time, Freud concedes that as the ego \\"attempts to mediate between id and reality, it is often obliged to cloak the [unconscious] commands of the id with its own preconscious rationalizations, to conceal the id's conflicts with reality, to profess...to be taking notice of reality even when the id has remained rigid and unyielding.\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 110 The reality principle that operates the ego is a regulating mechanism that enables the individual to delay gratifying immediate needs and function effectively in the real world. An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner, Daniel (2011). Psychology (1. publ., 3. print. ed.). Cambridge: WorthPublishers. . The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory. The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us. \\"The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a person on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with their own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces.\\"Freud,The Ego and the Id, On Metapsychology pp. 363‚Äì4. Still worse, \\"it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id.\\" Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. \\"Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it,\\" and readily \\"breaks out in anxiety‚Äîrealistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id.\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 110‚Äì11. It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of guilt, anxiety, and inferiority. To overcome this the ego employs defense mechanisms. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening. Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos. Denial, displacement, intellectualisation, fantasy, compensation, projection, rationalization, reaction formation, regression, repression, and sublimation were the defense mechanisms Freud identified. However, his daughter Anna Freud clarified and identified the concepts of undoing, suppression, dissociation, idealization, identification, introjection, inversion, somatisation, splitting, and substitution. \\"The ego is not sharply separated from the id; its lower portion merges into it.... But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it. The repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression; it can communicate with the ego through the id.\\" (Sigmund Freud, 1923)In a diagram of the Structural and Topographical Models of Mind, the ego is depicted to be half in the consciousness, while a quarter is in the preconscious and the other quarter lies in the unconscious. In modern English, ego has many meanings. It could mean one's self-esteem; an inflated sense of self-worth; the conscious-thinking self;http://www.worldtransformation.com/ego/ \\"Ego\\". In The Book of Real Answers to Everything!, Griffith J.. 2011. . or in philosophical terms, one's self. Ego development is known as the development of multiple processes, cognitive function, defenses, and interpersonal skills or to early adolescence when ego processes are emerged.  Super-ego  The super-ego ()Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (2018) [1973]. \\"Super-Ego\\". reflects the internalization of cultural rules, mainly taught by parents applying their guidance and influence. Freud developed his concept of the super-ego from an earlier combination of the ego ideal and the \\"special psychical agency which performs the task of seeing that narcissistic satisfaction from the ego ideal is ensured...what we call our 'conscience'.\\"Freud, On Metapsychology pp. 89-90. For him \\"the installation of the super-ego can be described as a successful instance of identification with the parental agency,\\" while as development proceeds \\"the super-ego also takes on the influence of those who have stepped into the place of parents ‚Äî educators, teachers, people chosen as ideal models\\". The super-ego aims for perfection. It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's ego ideals, spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called \\"conscience\\") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. \\"The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs.\\"Arthur S. Reber, The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology (1985) Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the inner critic as it appears in contemporary therapies such as IFS. The super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt. It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways. The super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two. Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the father figure and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the conscience, maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the Oedipus complex. Its formation takes place during the dissolution of the Oedipus complex and is formed by an identification with and internalisation of the father figure after the little boy cannot successfully hold the mother as a love-object out of fear of castration. Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus: The concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, \\"their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility.\\"Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (Penguin Freud Library 7) p. 342. However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect \\"that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics.\\"Freud, On Sexuality p. 342.  Advantages of the structural model  The iceberg metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another. Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of. At its heart was \\"the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs.\\"James S. Grotstein, in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 2003) p. x With what Freud called the \\"disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 101. Freud took the step in the structural model to \\"no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense,\\" and to rename \\"the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'.\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 104. The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of \\"conscious vs. unconscious\\". \\"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible.\\"Angela Richards \\"Editor's Introduction\\" Freud, On Metapsychology pp. 344‚Äì5. Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously: It is important to realise however, that \\"the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)\\"Angela Richards, \\"Editor's Introduction\\" in On Metapsychology p. 345.‚Äîthe id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully \\"the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement.\\"Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 104‚Äì5. The iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.  Translation  The terms \\"id\\", \\"ego\\", and \\"super-ego\\" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator James Strachey. Freud himself wrote of \\"das Es\\", \\"das Ich\\", and \\"das √úber-Ich\\"‚Äîrespectively, \\"the It\\", \\"the I\\", and \\"the Over-I\\" (or \\"I above\\"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term \\"das Es\\" from Georg Groddeck, a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as \\"the It\\"). The word ego is taken directly from Latin, where it is the nominative of the first person singular personal pronoun and is translated as \\"I myself\\" to express emphasis. Figures like Bruno Bettelheim have criticized the way \\"the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud\\"Quoted in Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1996) p. 10. by substituting the formalised language of the elaborated code for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.

Charlemagne ultimately prevailed, organized Saxony as a Frankish province, massacred thousands of Saxon nobles, and ordered conversions of the pagan Saxons to Roman Catholicism. In later times, Widukind became a symbol of Saxon independence and a figure of legend. Life Very little is known about Widukind's life. His name literally translates as \\"child of the wood\\" (i.e. a wolf), more probably a kenning than a proper name. In the chronicles he is accompanied by Abbi, they may have some close relation but it is not sure, because all sources about him stem from his enemies, the Franks, who painted a negative picture, representing him as an \\"insurgent\\" and a \\"traitor\\". While Widukind was considered the leader of the Saxon resistance by the Franks, his exact role in the military campaigns is unknown. According to the Royal Frankish Annals, the Franks campaigned in Saxony in 772, when Charlemagne ordered the destruction of the Irminsul sanctuary. The Saxon Wars continued when Westphalian tribes devastated the church of Deventer and the Angrarii laid siege to the Frankish court at Fritzlar. The king retaliated against the local nobility, enforcing the decree to incorporate the Saxon lands as a Frankish march. Widukind was first mentioned by the Annals in 777, when he was the only one of the Saxon nobles not to appear at Charlemagne's court in Paderborn. Instead, he stayed with the Danish king Sigfred (possibly Sigurd Hring). The next year, the Westphalians again invaded the Frankish Rhineland and subsequently fought a running battle against Charlemagne's forces and their local allies while the king was busy in Spain. By 782, Widukind had returned from Denmark and goaded the Saxon nobles into rebellion. From 782 to 784, battles between Saxons and Franks occurred annually, while Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons executed at the Massacre of Verden. Widukind allied himself with the Frisians but Charlemagne's winter attacks of 784/785 were nevertheless successful, and the dux and his allies were pushed back to their homelands. Charlemagne, leading an expedition towards the mouth of the Elbe, learned that Widukind was in the land of the Nordalbingians, on the right bank of the river. In the Bardengau in 785, Widukind agreed to surrender in return for a guarantee that no bodily harm would be done to him. He and his allies were then baptized, possibly in Attigny,Kampers, Franz. \\"Widukind.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 5 Jan. 2013 with Charlemagne as his godfather. Widukind thereby reached a peace agreement and the acknowledgement of the Saxon noble rank by their Frankish overlords. There are no contemporary sources about Widukind's life or death after his baptism. Historian Gerd Althoff assumed that he was imprisoned at a monastery‚Äîa fate that happened to other rulers deposed by Charlemagne. He tried to identify Reichenau Abbey as a likely location where Widukind may have spent the rest of his life,Gerd Althoff: Der Sachsenherzog Widukind als M√∂nch auf der Reichenau.

The Vita Liudgeri biography of Saint Ludger mentions him accompanying Charlemagne on his campaign against the Veleti leader Dragovit. According to the 12th- century Kaiserchronik, he was slain by Charlemagne's brother-in-law Gerold of Baar. Legend Charlemagne (742‚Äì814) receiving the submission of Witikind at Paderborn in 785, by Ary Scheffer (1795‚Äì1858). Versailles. Numerous legends developed around Widukind's life; he eventually appeared as a saintly figure (becoming \\"Blessed Widukind\\") and the builder of many churches. He was later assumed to have died in 807 or 808; his feast day is commemorated on January 6. According to legend, Widukind experienced a vision that led to his conversion. Disguised as a beggar, he was spying on Charlemagne's troop camp during Easter. He witnessed a priest performing a Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and the priest was holding a beautiful child during the consecration. To his astonishment, people would receive communion and the priest would give the same child to each person. Widukind was dumbfounded by this scene and went to beg outside after the mass. One of the emperor's servants recognized Widukind behind his disguise‚Äîdue to an odd formation of one of his fingers‚Äîand Widukind was captured. He was interrogated and confessed to spying on Charlemagne's camp for the purpose of becoming better acquainted with the Christian faith. He later confessed the divine vision he had seen. The emperor concluded that God had given Widukind the grace of witnessing the divine child, Jesus, behind the Sacred Host of the Mass. Widukind then renounced his worship of pagan idols.Martin Von Cochem, Cochem's Explanation of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass (1896) Later perception Medieval Since the 9th century, Widukind had been idolized as a mythical hero. Around 1100, a tomb for him was made in Enger; recent excavations have found that the contents of the tomb are indeed early medieval, but are the remains of a young woman. In 1971, archaeologists discovered three graves in a prominent place in front of the altar. The remains of three men who had died in the early 9th century, two of them about sixty-year-old warriors, the third a young man, were identified after a DNA analysis in 2002 as half-brothers or maternal cousins and a nephew. The man buried in front of the altar is assumed to be Widukind.Results (summary) of genetical analysis of the skeletons When in the 10th century Saxon kings (of the Ottonian dynasty) replaced the Frankish kings in East Francia (the later Holy Roman Empire), these kings proudly claimed descent from Widukind: Matilda, the wife of King Henry I, was apparently a great- great-great-granddaughter of Widukind. The House of Billung, to which several Dukes of Saxony belonged, had Matilda's sister among its ancestors and thus also claimed descent from Widukind. The Italian family Del Carretto (and its supposed French branch, family de Charette) also claimed to descend from the hero. In German nationalism Widukind became a hero for German nationalists in the early 20th century. German neo-pagans saw him as an heroic defender of Germany's traditional beliefs and their gods, resisting the Middle Eastern religion of Christianity. Christian nationalists also lauded him, linking Charlemagne with the humiliation of French domination after World War I, especially the occupation of the Rhineland, portraying Charlemagne as a \\"French\\" invader.Glen W. Gadberry, \\"An 'Ancient German Rediscovered' The Nazi Widukind Plays of Forster and Ki√ü\\", Essays on Twentieth-Century German Drama and Theater: An American Reception, 1977-1999, pp.156-163. After the National Socialists came to power in 1933, so many plays and other works were written about Widukind that there were complaints that he was becoming a clich√©. Alfred Rosenberg praised him as a hero of German freedom, who finally joined with the founder of the German Reich (Charlemagne). Two important plays about the Saxon leader were produced in 1934, Der Sieger (\\"The Victor\\") by Friedrich Forster and Wittekind by Edmund Kiss. The first celebrated the conversion of Widukind, but the second caused controversy because of its explicit anti- Christian message. In that play after the massacre of Verden, Saxon leaders say, \\"That is what the Christians have done; they feign love, but bring murder!\\"‚Äîa line that led to protests from the audience. The play portrays Catholic church leaders planning to destroy German freedom by forcing racial mixture on them, thus turning them into pliable \\"Untermenschen\\". Thousands of German maidens are captured and will be forced to mate with \\"Jews, Greeks, Italians and Moors\\" unless Widukind converts, which he does only to avoid this horrifying prospect. He gives a speech saying that the survival of the German race was his principal concern, and that future generations will praise him for this when the true spirit of the German people arises once more.

His three-volume Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres is an important chronicle of 10th-century Germany during the rule of the Ottonian dynasty. Life Corvey Abbey Church, westwork In view of his name, he possibly was a descendant of the Saxon leader and national hero Widukind, mentioned in the Royal Frankish Annals, who had battled Charlemagne in the Saxon Wars from 777 to 785. Widukind the Chronicler entered the Benedictine abbey of Corvey in the Westphalian part of Saxony around 940/42, probably to become a tutor. It is widely assumed that he had reached the age of 15 upon his access, though it has been recently suggested that he may have joined the Order as a child. In 936 Henry the Fowler, the first East Frankish king of the Saxon ducal Ottonian dynasty had died and was succeeded by his son Otto the Great. Otto's rise as undisputed ruler of a German kingdom against the reluctant dukes made great impression on the Benedictine monk. By his own admission, Widukind first wrote several Christian hagiographies before he began his Res gestae saxonicae. He dedicated the chronicles to Abbess Matilda of Quedlinburg (c. 955999), daughter of Emperor Otto the Great, like himself a descendant of the Saxon leader Widukind. The annals were written after Otto's coronation by Pope John XII on 2 February 962; however, though both Otto and his father Henry the Fowler are named Imperatores, this incident is not mentioned. After the elevation of Matilda's brother Otto II as co-emperor in 967 and the death of her half-brother Archbishop William of Mainz one year later, the abbess remained the only important member of the Ottonian dynasty in the Saxon lands under regent Hermann Billung; therefore, Widukind may have begun the writing‚Äîor started all over again‚Äîto create a kind of mirror for princes. The annals were continued until Otto's death on 7 May 973. Widukind probably died thereafter at Corvey Abbey. Work The Res gestae saxonicae are significant historical accounts of the times of Otto the Great and Henry the Fowler, modelled on the works of the Roman historian Sallust and the deuterocanonical Books of the Maccabees. Widukind wrote as a Saxon, proud of his people and history, beginning his narration not with the Roman Empire but with a brief synopsis derived from the orally-transmitted history of the Saxons and their struggles with the Franks, with a terseness that makes his work difficult to interpret. Widukind of Corvey starts with the wars between Theuderich I, King of Austrasia, and the Thuringii, in which the Saxons played a large part. An allusion to the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity under Charlemagne brings him to the early Saxon dukes and details of the reign of Henry the Fowler, whose campaigns are referred to in some detail. He omitted Italian events in tracing the career of Henry, nor does he ever mention a pope, but one of the three surviving manuscripts of his Gesta was transcribed in Benevento, the Lombard duchy south of Rome.Evellum The second book opens with the election of Otto the Great as German king, treats of the risings against his authority, again omitting events in Italy, and concludes with the death of his first wife Edith of England in 946. In the third book the historian deals with Otto's expedition into France, his troubles with his son Liudolf and his son-in-law, Conrad, Duke of Lorraine, and the various wars in Germany. A manuscript of Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres was first published in Basel in 1532 and is today in the British Library. There are two other surviving manuscripts. The best edition was published in 1935 by Paul Hirsch and Hans-Eberhard Lohmann in the series Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores rerum Germanicarum in usum scholarum editi.

The son of the 2nd Earl of Burlington and 3rd Earl of Cork, Burlington never took more than a passing interest in politics despite his position as a Privy Counsellor and a member of both the British House of Lords and the Irish House of Lords. Lord Burlington is remembered for bringing Palladian architecture to Britain and Ireland. His major projects include Burlington House, Westminster School, Chiswick House and Northwick Park. Life Portrait of Richard Boyle as a boy, with his sister Lady Jane Boyle, c. 1700 Coat of arms of Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, KG, PC Lord Burlington was born in Yorkshire into a wealthy Anglo- Irish aristocratic family as the only son of Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington and his wife, Juliana Noel (1672‚Äì1750). Often known as \\"the Architect Earl\\", Burlington was instrumental in the revival of Palladian architecture in both Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland. He succeeded to his titles and extensive estates in Yorkshire and Ireland at the age of nine, after his father's death in February 1704. During his minority, which lasted until 1715, his English and Irish lands and political interests were managed on his behalf by his mother and guardian, the Dowager Countess Juliana.Wilson, Rachel, Elite Women in Ascendancy Ireland, 1690-1745: Imitation and Innovation (Boydell and Brewer, Woodbridge, 2015). He showed an early love of music. Georg Frideric Handel dedicated two operas to him while staying at his residence Burlington House: Teseo and Amadigi di Gaula. According to Hawkins, Francesco Barsanti dedicated the six recorder sonatas of his Op. 1 to Lord Burlington, although the dedication must have appeared on the edition sold by Peter Bressan, before Walsh & Hare engraved the works c. 1727.Hawkins, Sir John: A General History of the Science and Practice of Music, Vol. 5, p. 372; T. Payne & Sons, London, 1776 Three foreign Grand Tours taken between 1714 and 1719, and a further trip to Paris in 1726, gave him opportunities to develop his taste. His professional skill as an architect (always supported by a mason-contractor) was extraordinary in an English aristocrat. He carried his copy of Andrea Palladio's book I quattro libri dell'architettura with him when touring the Veneto in 1719, but made notes on a number of blank pages, having found the region flooded and many villas inaccessible.Burlington to Sir Andrew Fountaine, 6 November 1719; quoted by Clark, J., in Barnard & Clark (eds) 'Lord Burlington, Architecture, Art and Life', 1995, 268. It was on this tour that he acquired the passion for Palladian architecture. In 1719, he was one of the main subscribers of the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage.Deutsch, O.E. (1955), Handel. A documentary biography, p. 91. Reprint 1974.See the year 1719 Handel Reference Database (in progress) Lord Burlington's first project, appropriately, was one of his own London residences, Burlington House, where he dismissed his baroque architect James Gibbs when he returned from the continent in 1719, and employed the Scottish architect Colen Campbell, with the history-painter-turned-designer William Kent assigned for the interiors. The courtyard front of Burlington House, prominently sited in Piccadilly, was the first major executed statement of Neo-Palladianism. In the 1720s, Burlington and Campbell parted, and Burlington was assisted in his projects by the young Henry Flitcroft (\\"Burlington Harry\\"), who developed into a major architect of the second Neo- Palladian generation, Daniel Garrett, a straightforward Palladian architect of the second rank, and some draughtsmen. Lord Burlington never closely inspected Roman ruins or made detailed drawings on the sites; he relied on Palladio and Scamozzi as his interpreters of the classic tradition to do so. Burlington's Palladio drawings include many reconstructions of Vitruvius' Roman buildings, which he planned to publish. In the meantime, he adapted the palazzo facade in the illustration for the London house of General Wade at Old Burlington Street in 1723, which was published for Vitruvius Britannicus iii (1725). This publication put a previously unknown Palladio design into circulation. Another source of his inspiration were drawings he collected, some drawings of Palladio himself which had belonged to Inigo Jones, and many more of Inigo Jones' pupil John Webb, which William Kent published in 1727 (although a date of 1736 is generally accepted) as \\"Some Designs of Mr Inigo Jones\\"... with some additional designs that were by Kent and Burlington. The important role of Jones' pupil Webb in transmitting the palladian-neo-palladian heritage was not understood until the 20th century. Mezzotint of Burlington By the early 1730s, Palladian style had triumphed as the generally accepted manner for a British country house or public building. For the rest of his life, Lord Burlington was \\"the Apollo of the arts\\" as Horace Walpole phrased it‚Äî and Kent, \\"his proper priest.\\" In 1739, Lord Burlington was involved in the founding of a new charitable organisation called the Foundling Hospital. Burlington was a governor of the charity, but did not formally take part in planning the construction of this large Bloomsbury children's home, completed in 1742. The architect for the building was a Theodore Jacobsen, who took on the commission as an act of charity. Many of Lord Burlington's projects have suffered from rebuilding or additions, from fire, or from losses due to urban sprawl. In many cases, his ideas were informal: at Holkham Hall, the architect Matthew Brettingham recalled that \\"the general ideas were first struck out by the Earl of Burlington and the Earl of Leicester, assisted by Mr. William Kent.\\" Brettingham's engraved publication of Holkham credited Burlington specifically with the ceilings for the portico and the north dressing-room. Lord Burlington's architectural drawings, inherited by his son-in-law, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, are preserved at Chatsworth House, and enable attributions that would not otherwise be possible. In 1751, he sent some of his drawings to Francesco Algarotti in Potsdam, together with a book on Vitruvius.MacDonogh, G. (1999) Frederick the Great, p. 192, 233‚Äì234.

Major projects * Burlington House, Piccadilly, London: Lord Burlington's own contribution to the house is likely to have been restricted to the former colonnade (demolished 1868) of the building. A monumental screening gateway to Piccadilly was built and the principle interiors of the house were reconstructed with typical Palladian features. In London, Burlington offered designs for features at several aristocratic free-standing dwellings, none of which have survived: Queensbury House in Burlington Gardens (a gateway); Warwick House, Warwick Street (interiors); Richmond House, Whitehall (the main building). * Tottenham House, Wiltshire, for his brother-in-law, Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury: Built from 1721, executed by Lord Burlington's prot√©g√© Henry Flitcroft (enlarged and remodelled since). In the original house, the high corner pavilion blocks of Inigo Jones' Wilton House were provided with the \\"Palladian window\\" motif to be seen at Burlington House. Burlington, with a good eye for garden effects, also designed the ornamental buildings in the park (now demolished). * Westminster School, the Dormitory: Built between 1722 ‚Äì 1730 (altered, bombed, and restored), the first public work by Lord Burlington, for which Sir Christopher Wren had provided a design which was rejected in favor of Burlington's, exhibited as a triumph for the Palladians and a sign of changing English taste. * Old Burlington Street, London: Houses, including one for General Wade which was built in 1723 (demolished). General Wade's house rendered the genuine Palladio facade in Lord Burlington's collection of drawings. * Waldershare Park, Kent, the Belvedere Tower: Built between 1725 ‚Äì 27. A design for an eye-catcher garden that might have been attributed to Colen Campbell were it not have been for a ground plan found among Lord Burlington's drawings at Chatsworth House. * Chiswick House Villa, Middlesex: The \\"Casina\\" in the gardens, constructed in 1717, was Lord Burlington's first essay. The villa, built between 1727 and 1729, is considered to be the finest remaining example of Neo-Palladain architecture in London and one of the gems of European 18th-century architecture. An attempt made by Burlington to create a Roman villa situated in a symbolic Roman garden.Hewlings, Richard. \\"Chiswick House and Gardens: Appearance and Meaning\\" in Toby Barnard and Jane Clark (eds) Lord Burlington. Architecture, Art and Life (London, Hambledon Press, 1995), pages 1‚Äì149. He built the villa with enough space to house his art collection, regarded as containing \\"some of the best pictures in Europe\\", and his more select pieces of furniture, some of which was purchased on his first Grand Tour of Europe in 1714. *Sevenoaks School, School House: Built in 1730. The school depicts classic Palladian work, commissioned by Lord Burlington's friend Elijah Fenton. * The York Assembly Rooms: Built between 1731 ‚Äì 32 (facade remodelled). In the basilica-like space, Lord Burlington attempted an archaeological reconstruction \\"with doctrinaire exactitude\\" (Colvin 1995) of the \\"Egyptian Hall\\" described by Vitruvius, as it had been interpreted in Palladio's Quattro Libri. The result was one of the grandest Palladian public spaces. * Castle Hill, Devonshire. * Northwick Park, Gloucestershire. * Kirby Hall, Yorkshire (an elevation). Marriage and children Dorothy Savile, Lady Dorothy Boyle (1724‚Äì1742), Countess of Euston, and Her Sister Lady Charlotte Boyle (1731‚Äì1754), Later Marchioness of Hartington, National Trust, Hardwick Hall. Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation. Burlington married Lady Dorothy Savile on 21 March 1720, the daughter of William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax and his second wife, Lady Mary Finch. Mary was the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Lady Essex Rich (died 1684). Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and Anne Cheeke. Anne was the daughter of Sir Thomas Cheeke of Pirgo and an earlier Lady Essex Rich (died 1659). This Lady Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick and Lady Penelope Devereux. Essex was probably named after her maternal grandfather Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Her maternal grandmother was Lettice Knollys. They had three daughters: * Lady Dorothy Boyle (14 May 1724 ‚Äì 2 May 1742). She was married to George FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, second son of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and Lady Henrietta Somerset. No known descendants. * Lady Julianna Boyle (1727 ‚Äì 1730). * Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle (27 October 1731 ‚Äì 8 December 1754). She married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington (later Duke of Devonshire after her death). They were parents to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington, and two other children. Burlington died at Chiswick House, aged 59. Upon his death, the Earldom of Cork passed to a cousin, John Boyle, and the title of the Earl of Burlington became extinct. It was recreated in 1831 for his grandson, George Cavendish, and is now held by the Cavendish family as a courtesy title for the Dukes of Devonshire.

In 1702, it was designated a fusilier regiment and became The Welch Regiment of Fusiliers; the prefix \\"Royal\\" was added in 1713, then confirmed in 1714 when George I named it The Prince of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. After the 1751 reforms that standardised the naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). It retained the archaic spelling of Welch, instead of Welsh, and Fuzileers for Fusiliers; these were engraved on swords carried by regimental officers during the Napoleonic Wars. After the 1881 Childers Reforms, its official title was The Royal Welsh Fusiliers, but \\"Welch\\" continued to be used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56. It should not be confused with the Welch Regiment, a different unit that recruited in South and West, rather than North Wales, and became part of the Royal Regiment of Wales or RRW in 1969. One of the few regiments to retain its original title, in March 2006 the Royal Welch Fusiliers was amalgamated with the RRW and became 1st Battalion, Royal Welsh, with RRW as the 2nd Battalion. History Henry Herbert, 4th Baron Herbert of Chirbury, founder of the regiment Formation; 1689 to 1773 The regiment was raised by Henry Herbert at Ludlow on 16 March 1689, following the 1688 Glorious Revolution and exile of James II.Cannon, p. 1Frederick, pp. 302‚Äì6.RWF at Regiments.org. It served throughout the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, including the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690,Cannon, p. 5 and Aughrim in 1691 which brought the campaign to an end.Cannon, p. 13 It joined Allied forces fighting in the Nine Years War and at Namur in August 1695, took part in the attack on the Terra Nova earthwork that inspired the song 'The British Grenadiers.' On the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702, it became The Welch Regiment of Fuzilieers; this denoted units equipped with light-weight muskets or 'fusils' used to protect the artillery, although the distinction later became obsolete. It served throughout Marlborough's campaigns in the Low Countries, including the battles of Schellenberg, Blenheim and Ramillies. In 1714, George I gave it the title of The Prince of Wales's Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. The next 28 years were spent on garrison duty in England and Scotland, until it returned to Flanders in 1742 for the War of the Austrian Succession. At Dettingen in June 1743, it rallied after being driven back by the elite French Maison du Roi cavalry; its steadiness was a major contribution to what is considered a fortunate victory. It incurred 323 casualties at Fontenoy in May 1745, before a brief period in Scotland during the 1745 Rising. Over 240 members of the regiment were lost at Lauffeld in July 1747, a defeat that led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.Fortescue, p. 161 Minden, 1 August 1759, an action still celebrated as Minden Day Following the 1751 reforms that standardised naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). In the opening battle of the Seven Years' War, it was part of the Minorca garrison that surrendered to the French in June 1756; given free passage to Gibraltar, from 1758 it campaigned in Germany. At Minden in August 1759, it was one of the infantry units that routed the French cavalry, an achievement still celebrated as Minden Day by their successor unit, the Royal Welsh. Between 1760 and 1762, it fought in the battles of Warburg,Cannon, p. 83 Kloster Kampen 1760Cannon, p. 84 and Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, before the war ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.Westlake, English & Welsh Regiments, pp. 75‚Äì6 When the American Revolutionary War began in 1773, the regiment was posted to North AmericaCannon, p. 89 The light infantry and grenadier companies took heavy losses at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775;Cannon, p. 93 it participated in nearly every campaign up to the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781.Cannon, p. 113 At Yorktown, it was the only British regiment not to surrender its colours, which were smuggled out by a junior officer. In the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, it was posted to the West Indies in 1794 and participated in the 1795 capture of Port-au-Prince before returning home in 1796.Cannon, p. 117 As part of the expeditionary force assigned to the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, it fought at Alkmaar in October 1799.Cannon, p. 120 23rd Royal Welch Fusilier guarding a statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington in London. 19th Century Invasion of Martinique (1809), St. George's (Round) Church, Halifax, Nova Scotia Apart from Egypt and the Battle of Alexandria in 1801 and the Invasion of Martinique in 1809 the regiment saw little action in the Napoleonic Wars until being sent to the Peninsular in 1810.Cannon, p. 134 Between 1811 and 1814, it fought in many of Wellington's actions, including the battles of Albuera, Badajoz, Salamanca, Nivelle and Toulouse.Cannon, pp.136-150 At the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, it was part of Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Mitchell's 4th Brigade in the 4th Infantry Division. In the nineteenth century, the regiment took part in the Crimean War, the Second Opium War, the Indian Mutiny and the Third Anglo-Burmese War. The Cardwell Reforms of 1872 linked most infantry regiments in pairs, but because the 23rd already had two battalions it was unaffected. Cardwell also introduced 'Localisation of the Forces', which established permanent regimental depots in county towns and brigaded the regular regiments with their local Militia and Volunteer battalions.Spiers, pp. 195‚Äì6. For the 23rd, this included:Army List, various dates. * 23rd Brigade Depot at Hightown Barracks in Wrexham from 1873 * Royal Anglesey Light Infantry ‚Äì converted to Engineers in 1877Frederick, pp. 162‚Äì4. * Royal Flint Rifles * Royal Denbigh & Merioneth Rifles * Royal Carnarvon Rifles * 1st Administrative Battalion of Denbighshire Rifle VolunteersWestlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 57‚Äì8.4th Bn RWF at Regiments.org. * 1st Administrative Battalion of Flintshire & Carnarvonshire Rifle VolunteersWestlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 37‚Äì8.Carnarvonshire & Anglesey Volunteers at Regiments.org.Westlake, Rifle Volunteers, pp. 89‚Äì90.Flintshire Volunteers at Regiments.org. The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further. The regiments were given names rather than numbers the regiment officially became The Royal Welsh Fusiliers on 1 July 1881, although \\"Welch\\" was used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56. The depot became the 23rd Regimental District depot, and the militia and volunteers became numbered battalions of their linked regiment (though the Royal Flint Rifles joined the King's Royal Rifle CorpsFrederick, pp. 242‚Äì3.): * 3rd Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers ‚Äì from Royal Denbigh Rifles * 4th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers ‚Äì from Royal Carnarvon & Merioneth Rifles * 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers ‚Äì from 1st Denbighshire Volunteers' * 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers ‚Äì from 1st Flintshire & Carnarvon Volunteers' * 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers ‚Äì formed in 1897 from the Carnarvonshire companies of the 2nd VB The 1st battalion served in the 1899 to 1902 Second Boer War; the 2nd battalion was stationed at Hong Kong until October 1902, when they transferred to India and were stationed at Chakrata. 20th Century Regimental Colour of the 6th (Caernarvonshire and Anglesey) Battalion, a Territorial unit of the Royal Welch Fusiliers The Haldane Reforms of 1908 converted the remaining Militia into the Special Reserve (SR) and the Volunteers into the Territorial Force (TF).Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. The battalions were now numbered sequentially within their regiment. The TF battalions of the RWF were given subtitles in 1909: * 3rd (Royal Denbigh & Flint Militia) Reserve Battalion (SR) at Poyser Street in Wrexham * 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion (TF) at Poyser Street, Wrexham * 5th (Flintshire) Battalion (TF) at Castle Precinct in Flint (since demolished) * 6th (Carnarvonshire & Anglesey) Battalion (TF) at Caernarfon Barracks in Caernarfon * 7th (Montgomery) Battalion (TF) at Back Lane Drill Hall in Newtown, Montgomeryshire ‚Äì transferred from the South Wales BorderersWestlake, Rifle Volunteers, p. 185.Merionethshire & Montgomeryshire Volunteers at Regiments.org.

Claims in 2008 they participated in the semi-mythical Christmas 1914 Football Game with the Germans have since been disproved. A number of writers fought with the regiment in France and recorded their experiences; David Thomas (killed 1916), Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon all served with the 1st Battalion. J C Dunn, a medical officer with the 2nd Battalion who had also served in the 1899-1902 Boer War, published The War the Infantry Knew in 1931. A collection of letters and diary entries from over 50 individuals, it is considered a classic by military historians for its treatment of daily life and death in the trenches. Good-Bye to All That by Robert Graves was first published in 1929 and has never been out of print; in one anecdote, he records the Regimental Goat Major being charged with 'prostituting the Royal Goat' in return for a stud fee. Graves also edited Old Soldiers Never Die, published in 1933; a rare example of the war seen by an ordinary soldier, it was written by Frank Richards, a pre-war regular recalled in 1914, who served on the Western Front until the end of the war. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn, killed at Passchendaele in 1917, were members of Kitchener battalions. The grave of Welsh poet Hedd Wyn, killed at Passchendaele in 1917 =First World War; Territorial and War Service= The TF battalions raised 2nd and 3rd Line battalions; in addition, the regiment raised over a dozen 'war service' battalions, informally known as Kitchener or Pals battalions.Peter Simkins, Kitchener‚Äôs Army: The Raising of the New Armies 1914 ‚Äì 1916 (2007) The 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion was one of the first TF units to see active service, landing in France in November 1914, where it remained until January 1919. Between 1915 and 1918, another 10 Royal Welch Kitchener battalions also fought on the Western Front, including the battles of Loos, the Somme and Passchendaele; a number of these were disbanded in early 1918 due to manpower shortages. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn served with The 11th (Service) Battalion landed in Salonika in November 1915, where it remained for the duration of the war.James, pp. 66‚Äì8. The 5th, 6th, 7th Territorial battalions fought at Gallipoli as part of the 53rd (Welsh) Division; by January 1916, it contained 162 officers and 2,428 men, approximately 15% of full strength. The 8th Kitchener Battalion was also at Gallipoli as part of 13th (Western) Division. They remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, the 53rd (Welsh) taking part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the 13th (Western) in the Mesopotamian campaign. =Interwar= The TF was reformed in 1920 and reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year. In 1938 the 5th (Flintshire) Battalion was converted into 60th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. Just before the outbreak of World War II the Territorial Army was doubled in size and the battalions created duplicates:Frederick, pp. 920‚Äì2. * 8th (Denbighshire) Battalion ‚Äì from the 4th Bn * 9th (Caernarvonshire & Anglesey) Battalion ‚Äì from the 6th Bn * 10th (Merionethshire & Montgomeryshire) ‚Äì from the 7th Bn * 70th Anti-Tank Regiment ‚Äì from the 60th Rgt; granted Royal Welch Fusiliers subtitle in 1942) =Second World War; Regular Army= The regiment was awarded 27 battle honours for World War II, with more than 1,200 fusiliers killed in action or died of wounds. Men of the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers celebrate St David's Day, 1 March 1940 During the Second World War, the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers was a Regular Army unit and part of the 6th Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division. It served in France in 1940 with the British Expeditionary Force.Joslen, p. 240 The battalion fought in the short but fierce battles of France and Belgium and was forced to retreat and be evacuated during the Dunkirk evacuation. After two years spent in the United Kingdom, waiting and preparing for the invasion that never came (Operation Sea Lion), the 1st RWF and the rest of 2nd Division were sent to British India to fight the Imperial Japanese Army after a string of defeats inflicted upon the British and Indian troops. The battalion was involved in the Burma Campaign, particularly the Battle of Kohima, nicknamed Stalingrad of the East due to the ferocity of fighting on both sides, that helped to turn the tide of the campaign in the South East Asian theatre. The 2nd Battalion was part of 29th Independent Infantry Brigade throughout the war. In 1942, it fought in the Battle of Madagascar, then part of Vichy French, before being transferred to the South- East Asian Theatre. In 1944, the battalion and brigade became part of 36th British Infantry Division, previously an Indian Army formation. Royal Welsh Fusiliers move forward on a jungle path near Pinbaw, Burma, December 1944 Both battalions came under the command of Lieutenant-General Bill Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army. This was known as the 'Forgotten Fourteenth,' allegedly because it fought in a theatre that seemed largely unnoticed and had little importance to the war. =Second World War; Territorial and War Service= Fusilier Tom Payne of 11 Platoon, 'B' Company, 6th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers, Normandy, 12 August 1944 The 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions, all Territorial units, served in 158th (Royal Welch) Brigade assigned to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division.Joslen, p. 346 They took part in the Battle of Normandy at Hill 112, where the 53rd Division suffered heavy casualties. Due to heavy fighting and casualties in Normandy, some of the battalions were posted to different brigades within the division. The 53rd again suffered heavily during Operation Veritable (the Battle of the Reichswald) under command of the First Canadian Army, in which action the British and Canadians, and the 53rd Division in particular, endured some of the fiercest fighting of the entire European Campaign against German paratroops.Barclay, p. 125 The 8th, 9th and 10th Battalions were 2nd Line Territorial battalions raised in 1939 as duplicates of the 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions respectively. The battalions initially served in the 115th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division, itself a 2nd Line duplicate of the 53rd (Welsh) Division.Joslen, pp. 87‚Äì88 The 8th and 9th battalions never saw action abroad, remaining in the UK throughout the war in a training role, supplying trained replacements to units overseas. In this capacity, the 9th battalion served with the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division and the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division.Joslen, p. 374 3-inch mortar of the 7th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, 8 December 1944 In the summer of 1942, the 10th battalion was converted into the 6th (Royal Welch) Battalion, Parachute Regiment.Horn, p. 270 The 6th Parachute Battalion was assigned to the 2nd Parachute Brigade, alongside the 4th and 5th Parachute battalions, originally part of the 1st Airborne Division. The battalion played a small part in the Allied invasion of Italy during Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing aimed at capturing the port of Taranto. After that, the 2nd Para Brigade became an independent brigade group. The brigade took part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France, being the only British troops to do so (see 2nd Parachute Brigade in Southern France).Harclerode, pp. 425‚Äì426 In late 1944, the brigade was sent to Greece to support pro-Western forces in the Greek Civil War, a forgotten but brutal episode now seen as the first act of the post-1945 Cold War. In 1938, the 5th Battalion transferred to the Royal Artillery as 60th Anti-Tank Regiment and in 1939, added a 2nd-Line duplicate, 70th Anti-Tank Regiment. Unlike 1914-1918, there were relatively few service battalions, one being 11th (Home Defence) Battalion, raised in 1939 as part of the Home Guard. Formed in 1940, the 12th battalion became 116th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in January 1942 and served with 53rd (Welsh) Division until disbanded in December 1944. Post Second World War After 1945, the regiment was mostly based in Germany and various British colonies, with the 2nd Battalion being disbanded in 1957. The regiment did not take part in the Gulf War, but did perform several tours in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) before being deployed to the Balkans. During the Yugoslav Wars, the regiment came to attention when 33 of their men and 350 other UN servicemen part of UNPROFOR were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs at Gora≈æde on 28 May 1995. The situation caused some political debate as the UN troops had been given orders only to \\"deter attacks\\" and did not have a mandate or adequate equipment to fully defend the mainly Muslim town of Gora≈æde, which was initially declared \\"safe\\" by the UN, thus rendering them exposed when armed members of the Army of Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Army) ignored the NATO ultimatum and attacked the town without warning. The regiment managed to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until they were forced to retreat into bunkers - those who did not make it quickly enough were taken hostage - and remained trapped underground while BiH Army reinforcements arrived and fought back. The commanding officer, Lt Col Jonathon Riley (later promoted to Lieutenant General), broke with protocol and directly reported to then Prime Minister John Major about the situation over the phone while in the bunker. All the men were eventually safely rescued. An unprecedented five gallantry awards, seven mentions in despatches and two Queen's Commendations for Valuable Service were awarded to the regiment. Although the incident was largely unreported at that time, the regiment was credited in hindsight by observers for saving the town from a possible genocide‚Äîafter failing to take Gora≈æde, the Bosnian Serbs continued south to Srebrenica, where they would massacre over 8,000 Bosniaks. Amalgamation It was one of only five line infantry regiments never to have been amalgamated in its entire history, the others being The Royal Scots, The Green Howards, The Cheshire Regiment, and The King's Own Scottish Borderers. However, in 2004, it was announced that, as part of the restructuring of the infantry, the Royal Welch Fusiliers would merge with the Royal Regiment of Wales to form a new large regiment, the Royal Welsh. Regimental museum The Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum is located in Caernarfon, Wales.

The tradition dated back to at least 1775, and possibly to the regiment's formation. The goat was always named 'Billy'. Uniform Soldiers of this regiment were distinguishable by the unique feature of the \\"flash\\", consisting of five overlapping black silk ribbons (seven inches long for soldiers and nine inches long for officers) on the back of the uniform jacket at neck level. This is a legacy of the days when it was normal for soldiers to wear pigtails. In 1808, this practice was discontinued but when the order was issued the RWF were serving in Nova Scotia and had not received the instruction when the regiment departed to join an expedition to the West Indies.British Army Uniforms & Insignia of World War Two; Brian L. Davis In 1834 the officers of the 23rd Foot were finally granted permission by William IV to wear this non-regulation item as a distinction on the full dress uniform as \\"a peculiarity whereby to mark the dress of that distinguished regiment\\". This was extended to all ranks in 1900. Khaki service dress replaced the scarlet tunic as the principal uniform, and the Army Council attempted to remove the flash during the First World War, citing the grounds that it would help the Germans identify which unit was facing them. As Fusilier officer Robert Graves reported, \\"the regiment retorted by inquiring on what occasion since the retreat from Corunna, when the regiment was the last to leave Spain, with the keys of the town postern in the pocket of one of its officers, had any of His Majesty's enemies seen the back of a Royal Welch Fusilier?,\\" and the matter remained \\"in abeyance throughout the war.\\" The efforts of the regiment to retain the distinction was further reinforced at a medal ceremony when King George V saw an officer of the regiment in the line. He ordered an About Turn and seeing the flash still on the tunic said sotto voce, \\"don't ever let anyone take it from you!\\" The wearing of the flash on service dress was extended to other ranks in 1924. As a fusilier regiment, the RWF wore a hackle, which consisted of a plume of white feathers mounted behind the cap- badge of the modern beret. The full dress of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, as worn by the entire regiment until 1914, included a racoon-skin hat (bearskin for officers) with a white hackle and a scarlet tunic with the dark blue facings of a Royal regiment. This uniform continued to be worn by the RWF's Corps of Drums and the Regimental Pioneers until the merger of 2006.  See also  * Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum Notes Bibliography Maj A.F.

Founded in Hamburg in 1877 to specialise in steel-hulled ships, its most famous product is the World War II battleship Bismarck. In the 1930s its owners established the Hamburger Flugzeugbau aircraft manufacturer which, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, adopted the name of its parent company. Following a difficult period after the war, B+V revived its fortunes by becoming a public company under a change of ownership. In 2016 it became a subsidiary of L√ºrssen and continues to supply both the military and civil markets. The company also carries out related activities, managing a dockyard in Hamburg and undertaking maintenance and repair of large cruise ships. Since the acquisition, it has been concentrated in three areas: warships (new construction), cruise ships and merchants (repairs) and \\"yacht refitting\\".Meyer, Kristian, \\"Erste Bilanz nach √úbernahme Alles neu bei Traditionswerft Blohm+Voss\\", Hamburger Morgenpost, 27 April 2018. The company has been in operation, building ships and other large machinery, almost continuously for years. History Early years Blohm & Voss 1877 Blohm & Voss was founded on 5 April 1877, by Hermann Blohm and Ernst Voss (or Vo√ü) as a general partnership, to build steel-hulled ships. It established a shipyard on the island of Kuhwerder, near the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, covering with of water frontage and three building berths, two suitable for ships of up to length. The company name was shown with the ampersand, as B&V;, until 1955. Shipbuilding was at that time dominated by the British, with even German customers preferring to buy from them. Initial business was confined to ship repairs, although B&V; managed to build and later sell the three-masted barque National. Eventually the first new-build order arrived for the small cargo paddle-steamer Burg, and the business took off. By 1882, the company had gained a reputation for quality and punctuality and was prospering. Initially, their products were steel-hulled sailing ships designed for long sea voyages. At that time steamships had a relatively short range, while many of the advantages of steel construction still applied to sailing ships as much as to steam. The company built its first steamship in 1900, while still continuing to build sailing ships until the late 1930s. The Nazi era, 1933‚Äì1945 German heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper at Blohm & Voss shipyards in 1939 When Hermann Blohm died, his two sons Rudolf and Walther took over. Ernst Voss left soon afterwards. By this time the company was in financial crisis, so the Blohm brothers diversified into aircraft, setting up the Hamburger Flugzeugbau (see below) in the summer of 1933.Pohlmann (1979). With the rise of the Nazi Party to power in 1933, Germany began to rearm and both companies became increasingly involved in the programme. The shipyard built both civilian craft and warships for the government, including the battleship , before manufacturing U-boats in quantity. In 1944 a subcamp of Neuengamme concentration camp was set up at the company's shipyard in Hamburg-Steinwerder.The camp Blohm & Voss is listed as No. 550 Hamburg in the official German list (List in German) It supplied labour to the company from July 1944 to April 1945. A memorial stands on the site of the camp and the company continues to pay an undisclosed amount to the Fund for Compensation of Forced Laborers.Herbert Diercks, Der Hamburger Hafen im Nationalsozialismus, 2008 Steinwerder was badly damaged during the bombing of Hamburg in World War II and at the end of it, shipbuilding was forbidden.Henry Burke Wend; Recovery and Restoration: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Politics of Reconstruction of West Germany's Shipbuilding Industry, Praeger, 2001, pp.196‚Äì198. Hamburger Flugzeugbau Ha 139 BV 238, largest Axis aircraft design to fly In 1933 Blohm & Voss was suffering a financial crisis from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long-range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. They formed the Hamburger Flugzeugbau that summer.Amtmann (1998)Pohlmann (1979). Most of the aircraft built by HFB/B&V; would in fact be other companies' designs and major subassemblies, contracted under license, including tens of thousands of aircraft each for Dornier, Heinkel, Junkers and Messerschmitt. Alongside its volume manufacturing the company also maintained its own design office and workshops which continued to develop and build new types throughout the company's life. The first planes it produced were designated with the official RLM company code \\"Ha\\". The aircraft produced by Hamburger Flugzeugbau were still commonly associated with Blohm & Voss and this was causing confusion, so in September 1937 Hamburger Flugzeugbau was renamed Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm & Voss and the RLM changed its company code to \\"BV\\".B+V Geschichte v. 1933-1938 -Die R√ºstungskonjunktur ab 1933 Its most significant designs were flying boats, mainly used by the Luftwaffe for maritime patrol and reconnaissance. Most numerous was the BV 138 Seedrache (initiated as the Ha 138), a twin-boom trimotor, while the BV 222 Wiking was much larger. Largest of all was the BV 238 prototype, the largest aircraft built by any of the Axis forces. Other notable types include the asymmetric BV 141, which was built in moderate numbers but did not enter production. At the end of the war, aircraft production was shut down. Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH (HFB) re-emerged in 1956, still under the ownership of Walther Blohm but no longer connected to B+V. It underwent various further changes of ownership and company name,Pohlmann (1979), 1982 edition, Page 242. eventually becoming part of Airbus. Postwar Administrative building Blohm+Voss, between Kuhwerder Port, Nordelbe and Norderloch After the Second World War, the British continued to demolish the shipyards of Steinwerder. B&V;, unable to restart shipbuilding work, all but ceased to exist for several years. In 1950 B&V; created a new subsidiary company, Steinwerder Industrie AG, to manufacture machinery and boilers on the site. Its shipyard fortunes began to revive in 1952 when the new company was allowed to restart ship repair work and the City of Hamburg subsequently guaranteed it credit. By 1953 some 900 workers were back in employment. The building of new ships would later also be allowed again. During this period of resurrection the level of investment required meant that B&V; moved out of private hands and became a publicly quoted company, 50% owned by Phoenix-Rheinrohr AG, itself soon to be consolidated into the Thyssen Group.Hamburg Journal, Part 2. Even so, B&V; would never regain its former size. In 1966 it took over neighbouring shipbuilder H. C. St√ºlcken Sohn.Mauerbl√ºmchen ist jetzt die Regierung (\\"Wallflower is Now the Boss\\"), Der Spiegel, 21 February 1966, pp.25-26. For many of its new warships, B&V; developed a modular approach to the equipment fit which they called Mehrzweck-Kombination (multipurpose-combination) or MEKO, which was intended to reduce costs and ease maintenance. Several classes of MEKO ship have been built, some in significant numbers. They have been sold both to the German Navy and for export. During the postwar years, B+V built oil rigs and developed a market for other offshore products such as support ships and pipelines.Cape Town shipyard busy with Scarabeo 3 upgrades, MarineLog (retrieved 26 April 2017)Semi submersible drill rig Chris Chenery , Oil Rig Photos (retrieved 26 April 2017)Offshore Units, Blohm+Voss (retrieved 26 April 2017) The company has also built ships for numerous commercial customers, including luxury yachts. Eclipse, built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, is in length making it the second longest private yacht in the world. B+V still administers the Elbe 17 dry dock at Hamburg. When Thyssen AG and Krupp merged in 1999, B+V became a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. In December 2001 Blohm+Voss, Nordseewerke and Friedrich Lurssen Werft were awarded the contract to build the first five K130 s. The first of them, Braunschweig, was built at Blohm+Voss, launched in April 2006 and commissioned in April 2008. Several problems with the equipment fit delayed commissioning, and the last was commissioned in 2013. In 2011 ThyssenKrupp agreed the sale of the Blohm+Voss civil shipbuilding division to British investment company STAR Capital Partners. The military division remained with ThyssenKrupp.Conrad Waters (Ed.); Seaforth World Naval Review 2013, Seaforth, 2012, p.134. In October 2016, regulatory approval was given for L√ºrssen to acquire Blohm+Voss from STAR Capital Partners.German Fair Trade Commission approves Blohm+Voss Acquisition, B+V web site, 31 October 2016. (Retrieved 17 April 2017). In April 2017 the company announced that it would be laying off about 300 employees. In September 2017, the German Navy commissioned the construction of five more K130 corvettes by a consortium of North German shipyards including ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Blohm+Voss, and the German Naval Yards in Kiel. The L√ºrssen Group, which would be the main contractor in the production of the vessels, distributed its work between the two sites at Wolgast and B+V Hamburg. The contract is worth around 2 billion euros. In April 2018 the German government announced the detailed worksharing arrangements under which the ships would be built. The German government also intends to build four new MKS 180 ships. L√ºrssen submitted a joint proposal with ThyssenKrupp, but in March 2018 it was turned down. Prior to this, ThyssenKrupp and L√ºrssen had been awarded a contract to build four s and delivered questionable built ships, that the German navy returned the ships to the builder in December 2017 for refit. There had been similar problems with the first set of K130 s delivered by the companies. Prior to being acquired, Blohm+Voss had allied with the Damen Group to also submit a proposal to build the MKS 180, which beginning of 2020 was selected by the German Navy (BaaiBW). Due to the decision to award the MKS180 contract to Damen Shipyards, ThyssenKrupp wants to sell its military naval systems yards in Hamburg, Kiel and at Emden. On July 25, 2019 Peter L√ºr√üen had presented a further development in yard of ‚Ç¨ 20 million invested. The Dock 10 is to be covered with a 200 m long and 50 m high roof by a cost of ‚Ç¨ 13 million, which can also fit up to medium cruise ships. The mount of Steel Pillar above Dock's Walls started only in October 2020. On January 2021 the Dock partly structured with the Yacht Project Opera, transferred from Dock 17 inside, would travel to Berne, Germany and stay there for 2 years. The Owner of previous 146 m Project Sassi, which burned, and only the engine section block was kept, expect his other project to be finish direct in Bremer L√ºr√üen. It is expected Dock 10 covered come back to Hamburg only in 2023, after finished the Yacht. For this the L√ºr√üen Dock 3 would be transferred to Wilhelmshaven at Jade Yard. In Berne a Hall would be extended. Since 2021 the Dock 17 would be unblocked. Ships built Passat Eclipse Bismarck F-224 of the German Navy Blohm & Voss was established in the days of sail and, although it built ships with steel hulls from the very first, it did not produce a significant steamship until 1900.

This creates, in effect, a \\"virtual object database\\" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, although some programmers opt to construct their own ORM tools. In object-oriented programming, data-management tasks act on objects that are almost always non-scalar values. For example, an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object- oriented implementation by a \\"Person object\\" with attributes/fields to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain \\"PhoneNumber objects\\" and so on. The address-book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as a method to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on. However, many popular database products such as SQL database management systems (DBMS) can only store and manipulate scalar values such as integers and strings organized within tables. The programmer must either convert the object values into groups of simpler values for storage in the database (and convert them back upon retrieval), or only use simple scalar values within the program. Object-relational mapping implements the first approach. The heart of the problem involves translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomized form that is capable of being stored in the database while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent. Overview Implementation-specific details of storage drivers are generally wrapped in an API in the programming language in use, exposing methods to interact with the storage medium in a way which is simpler and more in line with the paradigms of surrounding code. The following is a simple example, written in C# code, to execute a query written in SQL using a database engine. var sql = \\"SELECT id, first_name, last_name, phone, birth_date, sex, age FROM persons WHERE id = 10\\"; var result = context.Persons.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList(); var name = result[0][\\"first_name\\"]; In contrast, the following makes use of an ORM-job API, allowing the writing of code which naturally makes use of the features of the language. var person = repository.GetPerson(10); var firstName = person.GetFirstName(); The case above makes use of an object representing the storage repository and methods of that object. Other frameworks might provide code as static methods, as in the below, and yet other methods may not implement an object-oriented system at all. Often the choice of paradigm is made to fit the ORM best into the surrounding language's design principles. var person = Person.Get(10); Usually, the framework will expose some filtering and querying functionality, allowing subsets of the storage base to be accessed and modified. The code below queries for people in the database whose ID value is '10'. var person = Person.Get(Person.Properties.Id  10); Comparison with traditional data access techniques Compared to traditional techniques of exchange between an object-oriented language and a relational database, ORM often reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.Douglas Barry, Torsten Stanienda, \\"Solving the Java Object Storage Problem,\\" Computer, vol. 31, no. 11, pp. 33-40, Nov. 1998, http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/2.730734 , Excerpt at http://www.service-architecture.com/object-relational- mapping/articles/transparent_persistence_vs_jdbc_call-level_interface.html. Lines of code using O/R are only a fraction of those needed for a call-level interface (1:4). For this exercise, 496 lines of code were needed using the ODMG Java Binding compared to 1,923 lines of code using JDBC. Disadvantages of ORM tools generally stem from the high level of abstraction obscuring what is actually happening in the implementation code. Also, heavy reliance on ORM software has been cited as a major factor in producing poorly designed databases.Josh Berkus, \\"Wrecking Your Database\\", Computer, Aug. 2009, http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/database-soup/wrecking-your-database-33298, Webcast at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFLRc6y_O3s Object-oriented databases Another approach is to use an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) or document-oriented databases such as native XML databases that provide more flexibility in data modeling. OODBMSs are databases designed specifically for working with object-oriented values. Using an OODBMS eliminates the need for converting data to and from its SQL form, as the data is stored in its original object representation and relationships are directly represented, rather than requiring join tables/operations. The equivalent of ORMs for document-oriented databases are called object-document mappers (ODMs). Document-oriented databases also prevent the user from having to \\"shred\\" objects into table rows. Many of these systems also support the XQuery query language to retrieve datasets. Object-oriented databases tend to be used in complex, niche applications. One of the arguments against using an OODBMS is that it may not be able to execute ad-hoc, application-independent queries. For this reason, many programmers find themselves more at home with an object- SQL mapping system, even though most object-oriented databases are able to process SQL queries to a limited extent. Other OODBMS provide replication to SQL databases, as a means of addressing the need for ad-hoc queries, while preserving well-known query patterns. Challenges A variety of difficulties arise when considering how to match an object system to a relational database. These difficulties are referred to as the object-relational impedance mismatch.Object-Relational Mapping Revisited - A Quantitative Study on the Impact of Database Technology on O/R Mapping Strategies. M Lorenz, JP Rudolph, G Hesse, M Uflacker, H Plattner. Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), 4877-4886 (DOI:10.24251/hicss.2017.592) An alternative to implementing ORM is use of the native procedural languages provided with every major database. These can be called from the client using SQL statements. The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is used to abstract these statements and offer a lightweight object-oriented interface to the rest of the application.

Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting liturgical reforms and scholastic philosophy and theology. He initiated the preparation of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the first comprehensive and systemic work of its kind. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. Pius X was devoted to the Marian title of Our Lady of Confidence; while his papal encyclical Ad diem illum took on a sense of renewal that was reflected in the motto of his pontificate. He advanced the Liturgical Movement by formulating the principle of participatio actuosa (active participation) of the faithful in his motu proprio Tra le sollecitudini (1903), he encouraged the frequent reception of holy communion, and he lowered the age for First Communion, which became a lasting innovation of his papacy. Like his predecessors, he promoted Thomism as the principal philosophical method to be taught in Catholic institutions. As Roman pontiff, he vehemently opposed modernism and various nineteenth-century philosophies, which he viewed as an import of secular errors incompatible with Catholic dogma. He also reformed the Roman Curia (Apostolic Constitution Sapienti consilio, 1908). Pius X was known for his overall firm demeanor and sense of personal poverty. He frequently gave homily sermons in the pulpit every week, a rare practice at the time. After the 1908 Messina earthquake he filled the Apostolic Palace with refugees, long before the Italian government acted. He rejected any kind of favours for his family; his close relatives chose to remain in poverty living near Rome.. During his pontificate, many famed Marian images were granted a canonical coronation, namely the Our Lady of Aparecida, Our Lady of the Pillar, Our Lady of the Cape, Our Lady of Chiquinquira of Colombia, Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos, Our Lady of La Naval de Manila, Virgin of Help of Venezuela, Our Lady of Carmel of New York, and the Immaculate Conception within the Chapel of the Choir inside Saint Peter's Basilica were granted its prestigious honors. After his death, a strong cult of devotion followed his reputation of piety and holiness. He was beatified in 1951 and was canonized on 29 May 1954. The traditionalist Catholic priestly Society of Saint Pius X is named in his honor while a grand statue bearing his name stands within St. Peter's Basilica; and his birth town was renamed Riese Pio X after his death. Early life and ministry The Marian image of Our Lady of Confidence, for whom Pius X had a religious devotion. The Basilica of Saint John Lateran. Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto was born in Riese, Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Austrian Empire (now Italy, province of Treviso) in 1835. He was the second born of ten children of Giovanni Battista Sarto (1792‚Äì1852) and Margherita Sanson (1813‚Äì1894). He was baptised 3 June 1835. Giuseppe's childhood was one of poverty, being the son of the village postman. Though poor, his parents valued education, and Giuseppe walked to school each day. Giuseppe had three brothers and six sisters: Giuseppe Sarto (born 1834; died after six days), Angelo Sarto (1837‚Äì1916), Teresa Parolin-Sarto (1839‚Äì1920), Rosa Sarto (1841‚Äì1913), Antonia Dei Bei-Sarto (1843‚Äì1917), Maria Sarto (1846‚Äì1930), Lucia Boschin-Sarto (1848‚Äì1924), Anna Sarto (1850‚Äì1926), Pietro Sarto (born 1852; died after six months). He rejected any kind of favours for his family; his brother remained a postal clerk, his favourite nephew stayed on as village priest, and his three single sisters lived together close to poverty in Rome, in the same way as other people of the same humble background lived. At a young age, Giuseppe studied Latin with his village priest, and went on to study at the gymnasium of Castelfranco Veneto. \\"In 1850 he received the tonsure from the Bishop of Treviso, and was given a scholarship [from] the Diocese of Treviso\\" to attend the Seminary of Padua, \\"where he finished his classical, philosophical, and theological studies with distinction\\". A young Giuseppe Sarto On 18 September 1858, Sarto was ordained a priest, and became chaplain at Tombolo. While there, Sarto expanded his knowledge of theology, studying both Thomas Aquinas and canon law, while carrying out most of the functions of the parish pastor, who was quite ill. In 1867, he was named archpriest of Salzano. Here he restored the church and expanded the hospital, the funds coming from his own begging, wealth and labour. He became popular with the people when he worked to assist the sick during the cholera plague that swept into northern Italy in the early 1870s. He was named a canon of the cathedral and chancellor of the Diocese of Treviso, also holding offices such as spiritual director and rector of the Treviso seminary, and examiner of the clergy. As chancellor he made it possible for public school students to receive religious instruction. As a priest and later bishop, he often struggled over solving problems of bringing religious instruction to rural and urban youth who did not have the opportunity to attend Catholic schools. In 1878, Bishop Federico Maria Zinelli died, leaving the Bishopric of Treviso vacant. Following Zinelli's death, the canons of cathedral chapters (of whom Sarto was one) inherited the episcopal jurisdiction as a corporate body, and were chiefly responsible for the election of a vicar-capitular who would take over the responsibilities of Treviso until a new bishop was named. In 1879, Sarto was elected to the position, in which he served from December of that year to June 1880. After 1880, Sarto taught dogmatic theology and moral theology at the seminary in Treviso. On 10 November 1884, he was appointed bishop of Mantua by Leo XIII. He was consecrated six days later in Rome in the church of Sant'Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine, Rome, by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, assisted by Pietro Rota, and by Giovanni Maria Berengo. He was appointed to the honorary position of assistant at the pontifical throne on 19 June 1891. Sarto required papal dispensation from Pope Leo XIII before episcopal consecration as he lacked a doctorate, making him the last Pope without a doctorate before Pope Francis. Cardinal and patriarch Photo as Cardinal Giuseppe Sarto Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal in an open consistory on 12 June 1893. He was created and proclaimed as Cardinal-Priest of San Bernardo alle Terme. Three days after this, Sarto was privately named Patriarch of Venice. His name became public two days later. This caused difficulty, however, as the government of the reunified Italy claimed the right to nominate the patriarch based on its previous alleged exercise by the Emperor of Austria. The poor relations between the Roman Curia and the Italian civil government since the annexation of the Papal States in 1870 placed additional strain on the appointment. The number of vacant sees soon grew to 30. Sarto was finally permitted to assume the position of patriarch in 1894. As cardinal-patriarch, Sarto avoided political involvement, allocating his time for social works and strengthening parochial banks. However, in his first pastoral letter to the Venetians, Sarto argued that in matters pertaining to the Pope, \\"There should be no questions, no subtleties, no opposing of personal rights to his rights, but only obedience.\\" Pontifical election of 1903 Cardinal Luigi Macchi announces the election of Sarto as Pope Pius X On 20 July 1903, Leo XIII died, and at the end of that month the conclave convened to elect his successor. According to historians, the favorite was the late pope's secretary of state, Cardinal Mariano Rampolla. On the first ballot, Rampolla received 24 votes, Gotti had 17 votes, and Sarto 5 votes. On the second ballot, Rampolla had gained five votes, as did Sarto. The next day, it seemed that Rampolla would be elected. However, the veto (jus exclusivae) against Rampolla's nomination, by Polish Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko from Krak√≥w in the name of Emperor Franz Joseph (1848‚Äì1916) of Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed.Bingham, John. \\"Secret Conclave papers show how Saint Pius X was not meant to become Pope\\", The Telegraph, 4 June 2014 Many in the conclave, including Rampolla, protested against the veto, and it was even suggested that he be elected pope despite the veto. However, the third vote had already begun, and thus the conclave had to continue with the voting, which resulted in no clear winner, though it did indicate that many of the conclave wished to turn their support to Sarto, who had 21 votes upon counting. The fourth vote showed Rampolla with 30 votes and Sarto with 24. It seemed clear that the cardinals were moving toward Sarto. On the following morning, the fifth vote of the conclave was taken, and the count had Rampolla with 10 votes, Gotti with two votes, and Sarto with 50 votes. Thus, on 4 August 1903, Sarto was elected to the pontificate. This marked the last known time a veto would be exercised by a Catholic monarch in the proceedings of the conclave. At first, it is reported, Sarto declined the nomination, feeling unworthy. Additionally, he had been deeply saddened by the Austro-Hungarian veto and vowed to rescind these powers and excommunicate anyone who communicated such a veto during a conclave. With the cardinals asking him to reconsider, it is further reported, he went into solitude, and took the position after deep prayer in the Pauline chapel and the urging of his fellow cardinals. In accepting the papacy, Sarto took as his papal name Pius X, out of respect for his recent predecessors of the same name, particularly that of Pope Pius IX (1846‚Äì1878), who had fought against theological liberals and for papal supremacy. Pius X's traditional coronation took place on the following Sunday, 9 August 1903. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. There was however a cardinal-secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis. Pontificate An official photograph of Pius X wearing Papal regalia on 14 August 1903. Pope Pius X resting in the Vatican Gardens. The pontificate of Pius X was noted for its conservative theology and reforms in liturgy and church law. In what became his motto, the Pope stated in 1903 that his papacy would undertake Instaurare Omnia in Christo, or \\"to restore all things in Christ.\\" In his first encyclical (E supremi apostolatus, 4 October 1903), he stated his overriding policy as follows: \\"We champion the authority of God. His authority and Commandments should be recognized, deferred to, and respected.\\" His simple origins became clear right after his election, when he wore a pectoral cross made of gilded metal on the day of his coronation and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope complained that he always wore it and that he had brought no other with him. He was well known for cutting down on papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the pope dining alone, which had been established by Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends to eat with him. When chided by Rome's social leaders for refusing to make his peasant sisters papal countesses, he responded: \\"I have made them sisters of the Pope; what more can I do for them?\\" He developed a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him and talk to them about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance. Church reforms and theology =Restoration in Christ and Mariology= Pius X promoted daily communion for all Catholics, a practice that was criticized for introducing irreverence. In his 1904 encyclical Ad diem illum, he views Mary in the context of \\"restoring everything in Christ\\". He wrote: =Tra le sollecitudini and Gregorian chant= Within three months of his coronation, Pius X published his motu proprio Tra le sollecitudini. Classical and Baroque compositions had long been favoured over Gregorian chant in ecclesiastical music.J. de Luca, Disharmony among bishops: on the binding nature of a papal motu proprio on music, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society 35 (2014), 28-37. The Pope announced a return to earlier musical styles, championed by Lorenzo Perosi. Since 1898, Perosi had been Director of the Sistine Chapel Choir, a title which Pius X upgraded to \\"Perpetual Director\\". The Pope's choice of Joseph Pothier to supervise the new editions of chant led to the official adoption of the Solesmes edition of Gregorian chant. =Liturgical reforms= In his papacy, Pius X worked to increase devotion in the lives of the clergy and laity, particularly in the Breviary, which he reformed considerably, and the Mass. Besides restoring to prominence Gregorian Chant, he placed a renewed liturgical emphasis on the Eucharist, saying, \\"Holy Communion is the shortest and safest way to Heaven.\\" To this end, he encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion. This also extended to children who had reached the \\"age of discretion\\", though he did not permit the ancient Eastern practice of infant communion. He also emphasized frequent recourse to the Sacrament of Penance so that Holy Communion would be received worthily. Pius X's devotion to the Eucharist would eventually earn him the honorific of \\"Pope of the Blessed Sacrament\\", by which he is still known among his devotees. In 1910, he issued the decree Quam singulari, which changed the age at which communion could be received from 12 to 7 years old, the age of discretion. The pope lowered the age because he wished to impress the event on the minds of children and stimulate their parents to new religious observance; this decree was found unwelcome in some places due to the belief that parents would withdraw their children early from Catholic schools, now that First Communion was carried out earlier. Pius X said in his 1903 motu proprio Tra le sollecitudini, \\"The primary and indispensable source of the true Christian spirit is participation in the most holy mysteries and in the public, official prayer of the church.\\" He also sought to modify papal ceremonies to underscore their religious significance by eliminating occasions for applause. For example, when entering his first public consistory for the creation of cardinals in November 1903, he was not carried above the crowds on the sedia gestatoria as was traditional. He arrived on foot wearing a cope and mitre at the end of the procession of prelates \\"almost hidden behind the double line of Palatine Guards through which he passed\\". Anti-modernism Pope Leo XIII had sought to revive the inheritance of Thomas Aquinas, 'the marriage of reason and revelation', as a response to secular 'enlightenment'. Under the pontificate of Pius X neo- Thomism became the blueprint for an approach to theology. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Pius X's papacy was his vigorous condemnation of what he termed 'Modernists', whom he regarded as dangers to the Catholic faith (see for example his oath against modernism). He also encouraged the formation and efforts of Sodalitium Pianum (or League of Pius V), an anti-Modernist network of informants, which was seen negatively by many people, due to its accusations of heresy against people on the flimsiest evidence. This campaign against Modernism was run by Umberto Benigni, in the Department of Extraordinary Affairs in the Secretariat of State, which distributed anti- Modernist propaganda and gathered information on \\"culprits\\". Benigni had his own secret code ‚Äì Pius X was known as Mama. Pius X in his study while receiving a portraiture. Nearby is a statue of John Vianney. Pius X's attitude toward the Modernists was uncompromising. Speaking of those who counseled compassion to the \\"culprits\\" he said: \\"They want them to be treated with oil, soap and caresses. But they should be beaten with fists. In a duel, you don't count or measure the blows, you strike as you can.\\" The movement was linked especially to certain Catholic French scholars such as Louis Duchesne, who questioned the belief that God acts in a direct way in the affairs of humanity, and Alfred Loisy, who denied that some parts of Scripture were literally rather than perhaps metaphorically true. In contradiction to Thomas Aquinas they argued that there was an unbridgeable gap between natural and supernatural knowledge. Its unwanted effects, from the traditional viewpoint, were relativism and scepticism. Modernism and relativism, in terms of their presence in the church, were theological trends that tried to assimilate modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant as well as rationalism into Catholic theology. Modernists argued that beliefs of the church have evolved throughout its history and continue to evolve Anti-Modernists viewed these notions as contrary to the dogmas and traditions of the Catholic Church. In the decree, entitled Lamentabili sane exitu (or \\"A Lamentable Departure Indeed\\"), issued on 3 July 1907 by the Holy Office, Pius X formally condemned 65 propositions, mainly drawn from the works of Alfred Loisy and concerning the nature of the church, revelation, biblical exegesis, the sacraments, and the divinity of Christ. That was followed by the encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis (or \\"Feeding the Lord's Flock\\"), which characterized Modernism as the \\"synthesis of all heresies.\\" Following these, Pius X ordered that all clerics take the Anti-Modernist oath, Sacrorum antistitum. Pius X's aggressive stance against Modernism caused some disruption within the church. Although only about 40 clerics refused to take the oath, Catholic scholarship with Modernistic tendencies was substantially discouraged. Theologians who wished to pursue lines of inquiry in line with Secularism, Modernism, or Relativism had to stop, or face conflict with the papacy, and possibly even excommunication. Catechism of Saint Pius X Gala Berlin with throne produced in Rome by the Casalini brothers, renowned carriage manufacturers, during the papacy of Pius IX, whose coat of arms is painted on both doors. As shown by the emblems of Pius IX and Pius X, painted on the right and left doors respectively, the carriage was used during various pontificates until the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1905, Pius X in his letter Acerbo nimis mandated the existence of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (catechism class) in every parish in the world. The Catechism of Pius X is his realisation of a simple, plain, brief, popular catechism for uniform use throughout the whole world; it was used in the ecclesiastical province of Rome and for some years in other parts of Italy; it was not, however, prescribed for use throughout the universal church. The characteristics of Pius X were \\"simplicity of exposition and depth of content. Also because of this, Pius X's catechism might have friends in the future.\\".. The catechism was extolled as a method of religious teaching in his encyclical Acerbo nimis of April 1905. The Catechism of Saint Pius X was issued in 1908 in Italian, as Catechismo della dottrina Cristiana, Pubblicato per Ordine del Sommo Pontifice San Pio X. An English translation runs to more than 115 pages. Asked in 2003 whether the almost 100-year-old Catechism of Saint Pius X was still valid, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said: \\"The faith as such is always the same. Hence the Catechism of Saint Pius X always preserves its value. Whereas ways of transmitting the contents of the faith can change instead. And hence one may wonder whether the Catechism of Saint Pius X can in that sense still be considered valid today.\\" =Reform of canon law= Canon law in the Catholic Church varied from region to region with no overall prescriptions. On 19 March 1904, Pope Pius X named a commission of cardinals to draft a universal set of laws. Two of his successors worked in the commission: Giacomo della Chiesa, who became Pope Benedict XV, and Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII. This first Code of Canon Law was promulgated by Benedict XV on 27 May 1917, with an effective date of 19 May 1918,Ap. Const. Providentissima Mater Ecclesia and remained in effect until Advent 1983.Ap. Const. Sacrae Disciplinae Leges =Reform of Church administration= Pius X reformed the Roman Curia with the constitution Sapienti consilio and specified new rules enforcing a bishop's oversight of seminaries in the encyclical Pieni l'animo. He established regional seminaries (closing some smaller ones), and promulgated a new plan of seminary study. He also barred clergy from administering social organizations. Church policies towards secular governments Monsignor Eugenio Pacelli at left and Cardinal Secretary Rafael Merry del Val at the signing ceremony of the Serbian concordat during the pontificate of Pius X, dated 24 June 1914Pius X reversed the accommodating approach of Leo XIII towards secular governments, appointing Rafael Merry del Val as Cardinal Secretary of State (Merry del Val would later have his own cause opened for canonization in 1953, but still has not been beatified). When the French president √âmile Loubet visited the Italian monarch Victor Emmanuel III (1900‚Äì1946), Pius X, still refusing to accept the annexation of the papal territories by Italy, reproached the French president for the visit and refused to meet him. That led to a diplomatic break with France, and in 1905, France issued a Law of Separation, which separated church and state, and which the Pope denounced. The effect of the separation was the church's loss of its government funding in France. Two French bishops were removed by the Vatican for recognising the Third Republic. Eventually, France expelled the Jesuits and broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican. The Pope adopted a similar position toward secular governments in other parts of the world: in Portugal, Ireland, Poland, Ethiopia, and a number of other states with large Catholic populations. His actions and statements against international relations with Italy angered the secular powers of these countries, as well as a few others, like the UK and Russia. In Ulster, Protestants were increasingly worried that a proposed Home Rule Ireland run by Catholics inspired by Pius X would result in Rome Rule. In 1908, the papal decree Ne Temere came into effect which complicated mixed marriages. Marriages not performed by a Catholic priest were declared legal but sacramentally invalid, worrying some Protestants that the church would counsel separation for couples married in a Protestant church or by civil service. Priests were given discretion to refuse to perform mixed marriages or lay conditions upon them, commonly including a requirement that the children be raised Catholic. The decree proved particularly divisive in Ireland, which has a large Protestant minority, contributing indirectly to the subsequent political conflict there and requiring debates in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. As secular authority challenged that of the papacy, Pius X became more aggressive. He suspended the Opera dei Congressi, which coordinated the work of Catholic associations in Italy, as well as condemning Le Sillon, a French social movement that tried to reconcile the church with liberal political views. He also opposed trade unions that were not exclusively Catholic. Pius X partially lifted decrees prohibiting Italian Catholics from voting, but he never recognised the Italian government. =Relations with the Kingdom of Italy= Initially, Pius maintained his prisoner in the Vatican stance, but with the rise of socialism he began to allow the Non Expedit to be relaxed. In 1905, he authorized bishops in his encyclical to offer a dispensation allowing their parishioners to exercise their legislative rights when \\"the supreme good of society\\" was at stake.Pope Pius X (11 June 1905). \\"Il Fermo Proposito\\". The Holy See. Retrieved 22 May 2019. =Relations with Poland and Russia= Under Pius X, the traditionally difficult situation of Polish Catholics in Russia did not improve. Although Nicholas II of Russia issued a decree 22 February 1903, promising religious freedom for the Catholic Church, and, in 1905, promulgated a constitution which included religious freedom, the Russian Orthodox Church felt threatened and insisted on stiff interpretations. Papal decrees were not permitted and contacts with the Vatican remained outlawed. =Activities for the United States= In 1908, Pius X lifted the United States out of its missionary status, in recognition of the growth of the American church. Fifteen new dioceses were created in the US during his pontificate, and he named two American cardinals. He was very popular among American Catholics, partly due to his poor background, which made him appear to them as an ordinary person who was on the papal throne. In 1910, the pope refused an audience with former Vice-President Charles W. Fairbanks, who had addressed the Methodist association in Rome, as well as with former President Theodore Roosevelt, who intended to address the same association. On 8 July 1914, Pope Pius X approved the request of Cardinal James Gibbons to invoke the patronage of the Immaculate Conception for the construction site of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC. Miracles during the pope's lifetime Other than the stories of miracles performed through the pope's intercession after his death, there are also stories of miracles performed by the pope during his lifetime. On one occasion, during a papal audience, Pius X was holding a paralyzed child who wriggled free from his arms and then ran around the room. On another occasion, a couple (who had made confession to him while he was bishop of Mantua) with a two-year-old child with meningitis wrote to the pope and Pius X then wrote back to them to hope and pray. Two days later, the child was cured. Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini (later the Archbishop of Palermo) had visited the pope after Ruffini was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and the pope had told him to go back to the seminary and that he would be fine. Ruffini gave this story to the investigators of the pontiff's cause for canonization. Other activities Pius X consecrates Bishop Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa, the future Pope Benedict XV, in the Vatican in 1907. In addition to the political defense of the church, liturgical reforms, anti-modernism, and the beginning of the codification of canon law, the papacy of Pius X saw the reorganisation of the Roman Curia. He also sought to update the education of priests, seminaries and their curricula were reformed. In 1904 Pope Pius X granted permission for diocesan seminarians to attend the College of St. Thomas. He raised the college to the status of Pontificium on 2 May 1906, thus making its degrees equivalent to those of the world's other pontifical universities.. By Apostolic Letter of 8 November 1908, signed by the Supreme Pontiff on 17 November, the college was transformed into the Collegium Pontificium Internationale Angelicum. It would become the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in 1963. Pius X published 16 encyclicals; among them was Vehementer nos on 11 February 1906, which condemned the 1905 French law on the separation of the State and the Church. Pius X also confirmed, though not infallibly, the existence of Limbo in Catholic theology in his 1905 Catechism, saying that the unbaptized \\"do not have the joy of God but neither do they suffer... they do not deserve Paradise, but neither do they deserve Hell or Purgatory.\\" On 23 November 1903, Pius X issued a papal directive, a motu proprio, that banned women from singing in church choirs (i.e. the architectural choir). In the Prophecy of St. Malachy, the collection of 112 prophecies about the popes, Pius X appears as Ignis Ardens or \\"Burning Fire\\". In November 1913, Pope Pius X declared tango dancing as immoral and off-limits to Catholics. Later, in January 1914, when tango proved to be too popular to declare off-limits, Pope Pius X tried a different tack, mocking tango as \\"one of the dullest things imaginable\\", and recommending people take up dancing the furlana, a Venetian dance, instead. =Canonizations and beatifications= Pius X beatified 131 individuals (including groups of martyrs and those by recognition of \\"cultus\\") and canonized four. Those beatified during his pontificate included Marie- Genevi√®ve Meunier (1906), Rose-Chr√©tien de la Neuville (1906), Valentin Faustino Berri Ochoa (1906), Clair of Nantes (1907), Zdislava Berka (1907), John Bosco (1907), John of Ruysbroeck (1908), Andrew Nam Thung (1909), Agatha Lin (1909), Agnes De (1909), Joan of Arc (1909), and John Eudes (1909). Those canonized by him were Alexander Sauli (1904), Gerard Majella (1904), Clement Mary Hofbauer (1909), and Joseph Oriol (1909). =Consistories= Pius X created 50 cardinals in seven consistories held during his pontificate which included noted figures of the Church during that time such as D√©sir√©-Joseph Mercier (1907) and Pietro Gasparri (1907). In 1911 he increased American representation in the cardinalate based on the fact that the United States was expanding; the pope also named one cardinal in pectore whose name he later revealed thus validating the appointment. Pius X also named Giacomo della Chiesa as a cardinal who would become his immediate successor Pope Benedict XV. Death and burial Pius X on his deathbed In 1913, Pope Pius X suffered a heart attack, and subsequently lived in the shadow of poor health. In 1914, the pope fell ill on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August 1914), an illness from which he would not recover. His condition was worsened by the events leading to the outbreak of World War I (1914‚Äì1918), which reportedly sent the 79-year-old pope into a state of melancholy. He died on 20 August 1914, only a few hours after the death of Jesuit leader Franz Xavier Wernz and on the very day when German forces marched into Brussels. Pius X was buried in a simple and unadorned tomb in the crypt below St. Peter's Basilica. Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this in his burial and successive popes have continued this tradition. Canonization The statue of Pius X in St. Peter's Basilica. Although Pius X's canonisation took place in 1954, the events leading up to it began immediately with his death. A letter of 24 September 1916 by Monsignor Leo, Bishop of Nicotera and Tropea, referred to Pius X as \\"a great Saint and a great Pope.\\" To accommodate the large number of pilgrims seeking access to his tomb, more than the crypt would hold, \\"a small metal cross was set into the floor of the basilica,\\" which read Pius Papa X, \\"so that the faithful might kneel down directly above the tomb\\". Masses were held near his tomb until 1930. Devotion to Pius X between the two world wars remained high. On 14 February 1923, in honor of the 20th anniversary of his accession to the papacy, the first moves toward his canonisation began with the formal appointment of those who would carry out his cause. The event was marked by the erecting of a monument in his memory in St. Peter's Basilica. On 19 August 1939, Pope Pius XII (1939‚Äì58) delivered a tribute to Pius X at Castel Gandolfo. On 12 February 1943, a further development of Pius X's cause was achieved, when he was declared to have displayed heroic virtues, gaining therefore the title \\"Venerable\\". On 19 May 1944, Pius X's coffin was exhumed and was taken to the Chapel of the Holy Crucifix in St. Peter's Basilica for the canonical examination. Upon opening the coffin, the examiners found the body of Pius X remarkably well preserved, despite the fact that he had died 30 years before and had made wishes not to be embalmed. According to Jerome Dai- Gal, \\"all of the body\\" of Pius X \\"was in an excellent state of conservation\\". At the canonical recognition of his mortal body were present the Italian cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Nicola Canali. After the examination and the end of the apostolic process towards Pius X's cause, Pius XII bestowed the title of Venerable Servant of God upon Pius X. His body was exposed for 45 days (Rome was liberated by the allies during this time), before being placed back in his tomb. Pius X during his lying in state, 21‚Äì22 August 1914 Following this, the process towards beatification began, and investigations by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (SCR) into miracles performed by intercessory work of Pius X took place. The SCR would eventually recognize two miracles. The first involved Marie-Fran√ßoise Deperras, a nun who had bone cancer and was cured on 7 December 1928 during a novena in which a relic of Pius X was placed on her chest. The second involved the nun Benedetta De Maria, who had cancer, and in a novena started in 1938, she eventually touched a relic statue of Pius X and was cured. Pope Pius XII officially approved the two miracles on 11 February 1951; and on 4 March, Pius XII, in his De Tuto, declared that the church could continue in the beatification of Pius X. His beatification took place on 3 June 1951 at St. Peter's before 23 cardinals, hundreds of bishops and archbishops, and a crowd of 100,000 faithful. During his beatification decree, Pius XII referred to Pius X as \\"Pope of the Eucharist\\", in honor of Pius X's expansion of the rite to children. The tomb of Pope Pius X under the Presentation chapel altar in Saint Peter's Basilica. Following his beatification, on 17 February 1952, Pius X's body was transferred from its tomb to the Vatican basilica and placed under the altar of the chapel of the Presentation. The pontiff's body lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see. On 29 May 1954, less than three years after his beatification, Pius X was canonized, following the SCR's recognition of two more miracles. The first involved Francesco Belsami, an attorney from Naples who had a pulmonary abscess, who was cured upon placing a picture of Pope Pius X upon his chest. The second miracle involved Sr. Maria Ludovica Scorcia, a nun who was afflicted with a serious neurotropic virus, and who, upon several novenas, was entirely cured. The canonization Mass was presided over by Pius XII at Saint Peter's Basilica before a crowd of about 800,000 of the faithful and church officials at St. Peter's Basilica. Pius X became the first pope to be canonized since Pius V in 1712. His canonization ceremony was taped and recorded by early television news broadcasters, including NBC. Prayer cards often depict the sanctified pontiff with instruments of Holy Communion. In addition to being celebrated as the \\"Pope of the Blessed Sacrament\\", Pius X is also the patron saint of emigrants from Treviso. He is honored in numerous parishes in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and the United States. The number of parishes, schools, seminaries and retreat houses named after him in western countries is very large, partly because he was very well known, and his beatification and canonization in the early 1950s was during a period of time following World War II when there was a great deal of new construction in cities and population growth in the era of the baby boom, thus leading to Catholic institutional expansion that correlated with the growing society. Pius X's feast day was assigned in 1955 to 3 September, to be celebrated as a Double. It remained thus for 15 years. In the 1960 calendar, the rank was changed to Third-Class Feast. The rank in the General Roman Calendar since 1969 is that of Memorial and the feast day is obligatorily celebrated on 21 August, closer to the day of his death (20 August, impeded by the feast day of St Bernard).Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), pp. 101, 137 The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine was a big supporter of his canonization, partly because he had ordained the need for its existence in every diocese and because it had received a great deal of episcopal criticism, and it was thought that by canonizing the pope who gave them their mandate, this would help inoculate against this criticism. They initiated a prayer crusade for his canonization that achieved the participation of over two million names. After the Pope's canonization, another miracle is said to have taken place when a Christian family activist named Clem Lane suffered a major heart attack and was placed in an oxygen tent, where he was given extreme unction. A relic of the Pope was placed over his tent, and he recovered to the great surprise of his doctors. A sister of Loretto at Webster College in St Louis, Missouri, claimed that her priest brother had been cured through the Pope's intercession as well. Papal coat of arms Coat of arms of Pius X The personal papal arms of Pius X are composed of the traditional elements of all papal heraldry before Pope Benedict XVI: the shield, the papal tiara, and the keys. The tiara and keys are typical symbols used in the coats of arms of pontiffs, which symbolize their authority. The shield of Pius X's coat of arms is charged in two basic parts, as it is per fess. In chief (the top part of the shield) shows the arms of the Patriarch of Venice, which Pius X was from 1893 to 1903. It consists of the Lion of Saint Mark proper and haloed in silver upon a silver-white background, displaying a book with the inscription of PAX TIBI MARCE on the left page and EVANGELISTA MEUS on the right page. \\"Pax tibi Marce Evangelista Meus\\" (English: Peace to you, Mark, my evangelist) is the motto of Venice referring to the final resting place of Mark the Evangelist. This differed from the arms of the Republic of Venice by changing the background color from red to silver even though that did not conform to heraldic rules.Papal Heraldry, Donald Lindsay Galbreath, page 105. Previous Patriarchs of Venice had combined their personal arms with these arms of the Patriarchate.A Treatise on Ecclesiastical Heraldry, John Woodward, page 128 The same chief can be seen in the arms of the later popes who were Patriarchs of Venice upon election to the See of Rome, John XXIII and John Paul I. Renditions of this part of Pius X's arms depict the lion either with or without a sword, and sometimes only one side of the book is written on. The shield displays the arms Pius X took as Bishop of Mantua: an anchor proper cast into a stormy sea (the blue and silver wavy lines), lit up by a single six-pointed star of gold. These were inspired by Hebrews Chapter 6, Versicle 19, (English: \\"The hope we have is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul\\") As Bishop Sarto, he stated that \\"hope is the sole companion of my life, the greatest support in uncertainty, the strongest power in situations of weakness.\\" Although not present upon his arms, the only motto attributed to Pope Pius X is the one for which he is best remembered: Instaurare omnia in Christo (English: \\"To restore all things in Christ\\"), allegedly his last words before his death. In fiction The life of Pope Pius X is depicted in the 1951 movie Gli uomini non-guardano il cielo by Umberto Scarpelli. The movie is centered on the year 1914, as the Pope grieves over the threat that is incumbent and is consoled by his nephew. A satirical depiction of Pope Pius X is presented in Flann O'Brien's novel The Hard Life, as the Irish characters travel from Dublin to Rome and gain a personal interview with the Pope, which ends very badly.

He was probably the third and final bishop of Rome of Berber descent. Gelasius was a prolific author whose style placed him on the cusp between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages.The title of his biography by Walter Ullmann expresses this:Gelasius I. (492‚Äì496): Das Papsttum an der Wende der Sp√§tantike zum Mittelalter (Stuttgart) 1981. His predecessor Felix III employed him especially in drafting papal documents. During his pontificate he called for strict Catholic orthodoxy, more assertively demanded obedience to papal authority, and, consequently, increased the tension between the Western and Eastern Churches.  Place of birth  There is some confusion regarding where Gelasius was born: according to the Liber Pontificalis he was born in Africa (\\"natione Afer\\"), while in a letter addressed to the Roman Emperor Anastasius he stated that he was \\"born a Roman\\" (\\"Romanus natus\\").J. Chapin, \\"Gelasius I, Pope, St.\\", pp. 121-3, in New Catholic Encyclopedia, Second Edition, Volume 6, Gale, 2002. J. Conant opined that the latter assertion probably merely denotes that he was born in Roman Africa before the Vandals invaded it.J.Conant, Staying Roman: Conquest and Identity in Africa and the Mediterranean, 439‚Äì700, CUP, 2012, p. 83.  Acacian schism  The Papal election of Gelasius on 1 March 492 was a gesture of continuity: Gelasius inherited the conflicts of Pope Felix III with Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius and the Patriarch of Constantinople and exacerbated them by insisting on the obliteration of the name of the late Acacius, Patriarch of Constantinople, from the diptychs, in spite of every ecumenical gesture by the contemporaneous Patriarch Euphemius (q. v. for details of the Acacian schism). The split with the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople was inevitable, from the Western view, because they adopted the Monophysite heresy of Jesus Christ having only a Divine nature. Gelasius authored the book De duabus in Christo naturis (On the dual nature of Christ), which described Catholic doctrine in the matter. Thus Gelasius, for all the conservative Latinity of his style of writing, was on the cusp of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. During the Acacian schism, Gelasius advocated the primacy of the See of Rome over the universal Church, both East and West, and he presented this doctrine in terms that became the model for successive Popes, who also claimed Papal supremacy because of their succession to the Papacy from the first Supreme Pontiff, Peter the Apostle. In 494, Gelasius authored the very influential letter Duo sunt to Anastasius on the subject of the relation of Church and state, which letter had political impact for almost a millennium after.  Suppression of the Lupercalia  Closer to home, after a long contest Gelasius finally suppressed the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia, which had persisted for several generations among a nominally Christian population. Gelasius' letter to the Senator Andromachus treated the primary contentions of the controversy and incidentally provided some details of the festival, which combined fertility and purification, that might have been lost otherwise. Although the Lupercalia was a festival of purification, which had given its name \\"dies februatus\\", from \\"februare\\" (\\"to purify\\"), to the month of February, it was unrelated to the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also commonly denominated \\"Candlemas\\", which latter feast commemorates the fulfillment of the Holy Family's ceremonial obligations pursuant to Mosaic law 40 days after the birth of the first son. In the instance of the Holy Family, that occurred 40 days after Christmas, scire licet, on 2 February. Death After a brief yet dynamic ministry, Gelasius died on 19 November AD 496. His feast day is 21 November, the anniversary of his interment, not his death.  Works  Gelasius was the most prolific author of the early supreme pontiffs. A great mass of his correspondence survives: 42 letters according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, 37 according to Rev. Philip V. BaganRev. Philip V. Bagan, The Syntax of the Letters of Pope Gelasius I (Washington, DC, USA; The Catholic University of America Press, 1945). and fragments of 49 others, which are archived in the Vatican and that expound to Eastern bishops the primacy of the Roman pontiff. Additionally, 6 treatises are extant that bear the name of Gelasius. According to Cassiodorus, the reputation of Gelasius attracted to his name other works not by him. Decretum Gelasianum The most famous of pseudo-Gelasian works is the list De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis (\\"On books to be received and not to be received\\"), also denominated the Decretum Gelasianum, which is believed to be connected to the pressure for orthodoxy during his pontificate and intended to be read as a decretal by Gelasius on the canonical and apocryphal books, which internal evidence reveals to be of later date. Thus the determination of the canon of Sacred Scripture has traditionally been attributed to Gelasius.F.C.Burkitt, Review of The decretum Gelasianum\\", Journal of Theological Studies, 14 (1913) pp. 469-71, in www.tertullian.com. Gelasian Sacramentary In the Latin Catholic tradition, the pseudo Gelasian Sacramentary is in fact a liturgical book that was derived from Roman sources and transcribed, with inclusion of native Gallican liturgical elements, near Paris in the middle of the 8th century AD. While including the texts of some prayers that Gelasius composed, he was not a principal author or compiler of the book. The manuscript (Vatican, Vatican Library, Reg. lat. 316 + Paris, National Library, ms. lat. 7193, fol. 41-56) is actually titled the Liber sacramentorum Romanae ecclesiae (Book of Sacraments of the Roman Church). The attribution to Gelasius is premised in part at least on the chronicle of the Supreme Pontiffs that is denominated the Liber Pontificalis, which states of Gelasius that he \\"fecit etiam et sacramentorum praefationes et orationes cauto sermone et epistulas fidei delimato sermone multas\\" (\\"he also made prefaces to the sacraments and prayers in careful language and many epistles in polished language regarding the faith\\").Translation is based on Louise Ropes Loomis, The Book of the Popes (Liber pontificalis) I, New York, New York, USA, Columbia University Press, 1916, pp. 110-4 An old tradition linked the book to Gelasius, apparently based on the ascription of Walafrid Strabo to him of what evidently is this book.  Legacy  Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Tomasi quoted a portion of a missal that was attributed to St Gelasius in the Mass that was entitled 'Contra obloquentes' and published it. The section read: \\"Grant, We beseech Thee, O Lord, that we do not trouble ourselves about the contradiction of spurious minds, but once that very wickedness has been spurned let us pray that you suffer us neither to be frightened by the unjust criticisms, nor to be attracted to the insidious flatteries, but rather to love that which Thou dost command ...\\". In 1751, Pope Benedict XIV published this quotation within his Apostolic Constitution \\"Providas\\" that attacked freemasonry.Quo Graviora, Leo XII, 1826  See also  *List of Catholic saints *List of Popes *Famuli vestrae pietatis *Pope Saint Gelasius I, patron saint archive  References   Literature  The primary source for the biography of Pope Saint Gelasius I, beside the Liber Pontificalis, is a vita that Cassiodorus' pupil Dionysius Exiguus authored. *Norman F.

He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria's reign and remains one of the most popular British poets. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \\"Timbuktu\\". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. \\"Claribel\\" and \\"Mariana\\", which remain some of Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood. Tennyson also excelled at penning short lyrics, such as \\"Break, Break, Break\\", \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", \\"Tears, Idle Tears\\", and \\"Crossing the Bar\\". Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as \\"Ulysses\\", although \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote some notable blank verse including Idylls of the King, \\"Ulysses\\", and \\"Tithonus\\". During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success. A number of phrases from Tennyson's work have become commonplaces of the English language, including \\"Nature, red in tooth and claw\\" (In Memoriam A.H.H.), \\"'Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all\\", \\"Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die\\", \\"My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure\\", \\"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield\\", \\"Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers\\", and \\"The old order changeth, yielding place to new\\". He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. Early life Tennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England.Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Brief Biography, Glenn Everett, Associate Professor of English, the University of Tennessee at Martin He was born into a middle-class family distantly descended from John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers. W. E. F. Britten showing Somersby Rectory, where Tennyson was raised and began writing His father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778‚Äì1831), was an Anglican clergyman who served as rector of Somersby (1807‚Äì1831), also rector of Benniworth (1802‚Äì1831) and Bag Enderby, and vicar of Grimsby (1815). He raised a large family and \\"was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at Mablethorpe and Skegness on the eastern coast of England\\". Alfred Tennyson's mother, Elizabeth Fytche (1781‚Äì1865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734‚Äì1799), vicar of St. James Church, Louth (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between Horncastle and Louth. Tennyson's father \\"carefully attended to the education and training of his children\\". Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, Charles Tennyson Turner, later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred's future wife; the other was Frederick Tennyson. Another of Tennyson's brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum. Education and first publication Tennyson was a student of King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth from 1816 to 1820.Poems of Alfred Lord Tennyson. Eugene Parsons (Introduction). New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1900. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles. A portrait of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts is in Trinity's collection. At Cambridge, Tennyson met Arthur Hallam and William Henry Brookfield, who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of \\"his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles\\" entitled Poems by Two Brothers, published in 1827. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor's Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, \\"Timbuktu\\".Friedlander, Ed. \\"Enjoying \\"Timbuktu\\" by Alfred Tennyson\\" Reportedly, \\"it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor's gold medal\\". He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. \\"Claribel\\" and \\"Mariana\\", which later took their place among Tennyson's most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Return to Lincolnshire, second publication, Epping Forest In the spring of 1831, Tennyson's father died, requiring him to leave Cambridge before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. Arthur Hallam came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson's sister, Emilia Tennyson. John William Waterhouse's The Lady of Shalott, 1888 (Tate Britain, London) In 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of The Lady of Shalott. The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while on a holiday in Vienna. Hallam's death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including \\"In the Valley of Cauteretz\\" and In Memoriam A.H.H., a long poem detailing the \\"Way of the Soul\\".H. Tennyson (1897). Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir by His Son, New York: MacMillan. Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson's son recalled: ‚Äúthere was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...\\". Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare.\\"History of Holy Innocents Church\\" , Highbeachchurch.org. Retrieved 27 April 2012 An unwise investment in Dr Allen's ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham. Third publication In 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two volume Poems, of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as Locksley Hall, \\"Break, Break, Break\\", and Ulysses, and a new version of The Lady of Shalott, have met enduring fame. The Princess: A Medley, a satire on women's education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. W. S. Gilbert later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in The Princess (1870) and in Princess Ida (1884). It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, In Memoriam A.H.H., dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed Poet Laureate, succeeding William Wordsworth. In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married Emily Sellwood, whom he had known since childhood, in the village of Shiplake. They had two sons, Hallam Tennyson (b. 11 August 1852)‚Äînamed after his friend‚Äîand Lionel (b. 16 March 1854). Tennyson rented Farringford House on the Isle of Wight in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856.The Home of Tennyson Rebecca FitzGerald, Farringford: The Home of Tennyson official website He eventually found that there were too many starstruck tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to Aldworth, in West Sussex in 1869. However, he retained Farringford, and regularly returned there to spend the winters.

Tennyson: To Strive, To Seek, To Find. London: Chatto and Windus, 2012. He held the position until his own death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position by turning out appropriate but often uninspired verse, such as a poem of greeting to Princess Alexandra of Denmark when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King Edward VII. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in an ill-advised charge on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include \\"Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington\\" and \\"Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition\\". Alfred Tennyson, portrait by P. Kr√§mer Tennyson initially declined a baronetcy in 1865 and 1868 (when tendered by Disraeli), finally accepting a peerage in 1883 at Gladstone's earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him Baron Tennyson, of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884. Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose \\"Form, Riflemen, Form\\", on the French crisis of 1859 and the Creation of the Volunteer Force, to \\"Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering\\", deploring Gladstone's Home Rule Bill. Tennyson's family were Whigs by tradition and Tennyson's own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the Liberal Party after the Whigs dissolved. Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. Upon passage of the 1832 Reform Act, Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration. Virginia Woolf wrote a play called Freshwater, showing Tennyson as host to his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and G.F. Watts. Tennyson was the first to be raised to a British peerage for his writing. A passionate man with some peculiarities of nature, he was never particularly comfortable as a peer, and it is widely held that he took the peerage in order to secure a future for his son Hallam. Colonel George Edward Gouraud, Thomas Edison's European agent, made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry, late in his life. They include recordings of \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\", and excerpts from \\"The splendour falls\\" (from The Princess), \\"Come into the garden\\" (from Maud), \\"Ask me no more\\", \\"Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington\\" and \\"Lancelot and Elaine\\". The sound quality is poor, as wax cylinder recordings usually are. arbour at Farringford House, his home in the village of Freshwater, Isle of Wight. Towards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his \\"religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism\\": In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief. Famously, he wrote in In Memoriam: \\"There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.\\" In Maud, 1855, he wrote: \\"The churches have killed their Christ\\". In \\"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\\", Tennyson wrote: \\"Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate.\\" In his play, Becket, he wrote: \\"We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven\\". Tennyson recorded in his Diary (p. 127): \\"I believe in Pantheism of a sort\\". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Spinoza on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, \\"His view of God is in some ways mine\\", in 1892.Freethought of the Day, 6 August 2006, Alfred Tennyson Monument to Tennyson on Tennyson Down, Isle of Wight Tennyson continued writing into his eighties.

Lake Tennyson in New Zealand's high country, named by Frederick Weld, is assumed to be named after Lord Tennyson. He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son, Hallam, who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second Governor-General of Australia. Tennyson and the Queen Although Prince Albert was largely responsible for Tennyson's appointment as Laureate, Queen Victoria became an ardent admirer of Tennyson's work, writing in her diary that she was \\"much soothed & pleased\\" by reading \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" after Albert's death. The two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, \\"very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair & a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him.\\" Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" had been. The art of Tennyson's poetry As source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of John Keats and other Romantic poets published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of Break, Break, Break emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson's use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of \\"I come from haunts of coot and hern\\" lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of \\"Come down O maid from yonder mountain height\\" illustrate his telling combination of onomatopoeia, alliteration, and assonance: : The moan of doves in immemorial elms : And murmuring of innumerable bees. Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self- editing were described by his contemporary Robert Browning as \\"insane\\", symptomatic of \\"mental infirmity\\". His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and text, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of metre; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the quantitative metres of Greek and Latin poetry to English. He reflects the Victorian period of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among Victorian writers in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his \\"Englishness\\" and his masculinity. Well known among his longer works are Maud and Idylls of the King, the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including Mariana, The Lotos Eaters, Tears, Idle Tears, In Memoriam), possibly reflecting Tennyson's own lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. T. S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as \\"the saddest of all English poets\\", whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a \\"surface\\" to his poetry's \\"depths, to the abyss of sorrow\\".T. S. Eliot, Selected Prose of T. S. Eliot. Ed. Frank Kermode. New York: Harcourt, 1975. P. 246. Other poets such as W. H. Auden maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the \\"stupidest\\" of all the English poets, adding that: \\"There was little about melancholia he didn't know; there was little else that he did.\\"Carol T. Christ, Catherine Robson, The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume E: The Victorian Age. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt & M.H. Abrams. New York: Norton, 2006. p. 1111 Influence on Pre-Raphaelite artists Tennyson's early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of \\"Immortals\\", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including Keats and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings. The Lady of Shalott alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt, John William Waterhouse (three versions), and Elizabeth Siddall.

As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage. Vertical distance measurements in the \\"down\\" direction are commonly referred to as depth.  In aviation 383x383px Vertical distance comparison In aviation, the term altitude can have several meanings, and is always qualified by explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. \\"true altitude\\"), or implicitly through the context of the communication. Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used. Aviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum. Pressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30 m) is the flight level, and is used above the transition altitude ( in the US, but may be as low as in other jurisdictions); so when the altimeter reads 18,000 ft on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at \\"Flight level 180\\". When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 inHg or 1013.25 hPa). On the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter, which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure. There are several types of altitude in aviation: * Indicated altitude is the reading on the altimeter when it is set to the local barometric pressure at mean sea level. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from mean sea level; this is referred to over the radio as altitude.(see QNH) * Absolute altitude is the vertical distance of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying. It can be measured using a radar altimeter (or \\"absolute altimeter\\"). Also referred to as \\"radar height\\" or feet/metres above ground level (AGL). * True altitude is the actual elevation above mean sea level. It is indicated altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure. * Height is the vertical distance above a reference point, commonly the terrain elevation.radiotelephony usage, the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from a specified datum; this is referred to over the radio as height, where the specified datum is the airfield elevation (see QFE) * Pressure altitude is the elevation above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically, 1013.25 millibars or 29.92\\" Hg). Pressure altitude is used to indicate \\"flight level\\" which is the standard for altitude reporting in the Class A airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet). Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 29.92\\" Hg or 1013.25 millibars. *Density altitude is the altitude corrected for non-ISA International Standard Atmosphere atmospheric conditions. Aircraft performance depends on density altitude, which is affected by barometric pressure, humidity and temperature. On a very hot day, density altitude at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff, particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft. These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude: *Indicated altitude ‚Äì the altitude shown on the altimeter. *Absolute altitude ‚Äì altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below *True altitude ‚Äì altitude in terms of elevation above sea level *Height ‚Äì vertical distance above a certain point *Pressure altitude ‚Äì the air pressure in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere *Density altitude ‚Äì the density of the air in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere in the air In atmospheric studies Atmospheric layers The Earth's atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions. These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles. The altitudes stated below are averages: * Troposphere: surface to at the poles, at the Equator, ending at the Tropopause * Stratosphere: Troposphere to * Mesosphere: Stratosphere to * Thermosphere: Mesosphere to * Exosphere: Thermosphere to The K√°rm√°n line, at an altitude of above sea level, by convention defines represents the demarcation between the atmosphere and space. The thermosphere and exosphere (along with the higher parts of the mesosphere) are regions of the atmosphere that are conventionally defined as space. High altitude and low pressure Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at above sea level. At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand. Temperature profile The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly , and the temperature would decay exponentially with height. However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 ¬∞C per kilometer (or per 1000 feet) of altitude. Note that the presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 ¬∞C per kilometer or per 1000 feet). As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 ¬∞C per kilometer (3.56 ¬∞F per 1,000 feet). The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location. Finally, note that only the troposphere (up to approximately of altitude) in the Earth's atmosphere undergoes notable convection; in the stratosphere, there is little vertical convection. Effects on organisms Humans Medicine recognizes that altitudes above start to affect humans, and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above for more than two years. As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen. The lack of oxygen above can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema. The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry. It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude. However, above , (in the \\"death zone\\"), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible. There is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes. Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer's disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia. However, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far. =Athletes= For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance. For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete's performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than with the letter \\"A\\". Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming. Other organisms Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic. There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures. These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity. However, some species, such as birds, thrive at high altitude. Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight.

It can also be understood as the free market idea applied to international trade. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold liberal economic positions while economically left-wing and nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade. Most nations are today members of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade agreements. Free trade was best exemplified by the unilateral stance of Great Britain who reduced regulations and duties on imports and exports from the mid nineteenth century to the 1920s. An alternative approach, of creating free trade areas between groups of countries by agreement, such as that of the European Economic Area and the Mercosur open markets, creates a protectionist barrier between that free trade area and the rest of the world. Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas, taxes and non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation. Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been. There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growthSee P.Krugman, ¬´The Narrow and Broad Arguments for Free Trade¬ª, American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings, 83(3), 1993 ; and P.Krugman, Peddling Prosperity: Economic Sense and Nonsense in the Age of Diminished Expectations, New York, W.W. Norton & Company, 1994.N. Gregory Mankiw, Economists Actually Agree on This: The Wisdom of Free Trade, New York Times (April 24, 2015): \\"Economists are famous for disagreeing with one another.... But economists reach near unanimity on some topics, including international trade.\\"William Poole, Free Trade: Why Are Economists and Noneconomists So Far Apart, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review, September/October 2004, 86(5), pp. 1: \\"most observers agree that '[t]he consensus among mainstream economists on the desirability of free trade remains almost universal.'\\" and economic stability. However, liberalization of trade can cause significant and unequally distributed losses, and the economic dislocation of workers in import- competing sectors.  Features  Free trade policies may promote the following features: * Trade of goods without taxes (including tariffs) or other trade barriers (e.g. quotas on imports or subsidies for producers). * Trade in services without taxes or other trade barriers. * The absence of \\"trade-distorting\\" policies (such as taxes, subsidies, regulations, or laws) that give some firms, households, or factors of production an advantage over others. * Unregulated access to markets. * Unregulated access to market information. * Inability of firms to distort markets through government- imposed monopoly or oligopoly power. * Trade agreements which encourage free trade.  Economics   Economic models  Two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota. An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.Thom Hartmann, Unequal Protection, Second Edition, Chapter 20. p. 255 Most economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist Ha-Joon Chang, a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system.Pugel (2007), International Economics, pp. 311‚Äì312. Counterarguments to Chang's point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century. If the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries, it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as import substitution industrialization, is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations. = Tariffs = The pink regions are the net loss to society caused by the existence of the tariff The chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market (and hence in the domestic market) is Pworld. The tariff increases the domestic price to Ptariff. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from QS1 to QS2 and causes domestic consumption to decline from QC1 to QC2.Alan C. Stockman, Introduction to Economics, Second Edition, Chapter 9.N. Gregory Mankiw, Macroeconomics, Fifth Edition, Chapter 7. This has three main effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society. An almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country's perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results. Sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the size of the winnings from free trade are larger than the losses.  Trade diversion  According to mainstream economics theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to economic inefficiency through the process of trade diversion. It is efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This reason is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the Doha Round.Steven E. Landsburg. Price Theory and Applications, Sixth Edition, Chapter 8.  Opinions   Economist opinions  The literature analysing the economics of free trade is rich. Economists have done extensive work on the theoretical and empirical effects of free trade. Although it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade provides a net gain for society. In a 2006 survey of American economists (83 responders), \\"87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade\\" and \\"90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries\\". Quoting Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, \\"[f]ew propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards\\". In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that \\"freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment\\". Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that a certain industry could settle in a particular geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both winner and loser will increase, with the winner gaining more than the loser, but both gaining more than before in an absolute level.  Public Opinions  An overwhelming number of people internationally ‚Äì both in developed and developing countries ‚Äì support trade with other countries, but are more split when it comes to whether or not they believe trade creates jobs, increases wages, and decreases prices. The median belief in advanced economies is that trade increase increases wages, with 31 percent of people believing they do, compared to 27 percent who they decrease wages. In emerging economies, 47 percent of people believe trade increases wages, compared to 20 percent who says it lowers wages. There is a positive relationship of 0.66 between the average GDP growth rate for the years 2014 to 2017 and the percentage of people in a given country that says trade increases wages. Most people, in both advanced and emerging economies, believe that trade increases prices. 35 percent of people in advanced economies and 56 percent in emerging economies believe trade increases prices, and 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively, believe that trade lowers prices. Those with a higher level of education are more likely than those with less education to believe that trade lowers prices.  History   Early era  David Ricardo The notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in 16th century Imperial Spain. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria was \\"the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas\\". Vitoria made the case under principles of jus gentium. However, it was two early British economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form. Economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically. For example, Smith pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt, Greece and Rome, but also of Bengal (East India) and China. The great prosperity of the Netherlands after throwing off Spanish Imperial rule and pursuing a policy of free trade made the free trade/mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries. Free trade policies have battled with mercantilist, protectionist, isolationist, socialist, populist and other policies over the centuries. The Ottoman Empire had liberal free trade policies by the 18th century, with origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673, in 1740 which lowered duties to only 3% for imports and exports and in 1790. Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade such as J. R. McCulloch in his Dictionary of Commerce (1834), but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as \\"an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition\\" in the 1846 Corn Laws debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been \\"some of the finest manufactures of the world\\" in 1812. Average tariff rates in France, the United Kingdom and the United States Trade in colonial America was regulated by the British mercantile system through the Acts of Trade and Navigation. Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced (New England was famous for smuggling), but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the American Revolution. \\"The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong\\", wrote Dickerson, \\"was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders\\".Dickerson, The Navigation Acts and the American Revolution, p. 140. Free trade came to what would become the United States as a result of American Revolutionary War. After the British Parliament issued the Prohibitory Act, blockading colonial ports, the Continental Congress responded by effectively declaring economic independence, opening American ports to foreign trade on 6 April 1776. According to historian John W. Tyler, \\"[f]ree trade had been forced on the Americans, like it or not\\".Tyler, Smugglers & Patriots, p. 238. In March 1801, the Pope Pius VII ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the Papal States with the motu proprio Le pi√π colte. Despite this, the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the Papal States. Britain waged two Opium Wars to force China to legalize the opium trade and to open all of China to British merchants In Britain, free trade became a central principle practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Large-scale agitation was sponsored by the Anti-Corn Law League. Under the Treaty of Nanking, China opened five treaty ports to world trade in 1843. The first free trade agreement, the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty, was put in place in 1860 between Britain and France which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe. Many classical liberals, especially in 19th and early 20th century Britain (e.g. John Stuart Mill) and in the United States for much of the 20th century (e.g. Henry Ford and Secretary of State Cordell Hull), believed that free trade promoted peace. Woodrow Wilson included free- trade rhetoric in his \\"Fourteen Points\\" speech of 1918: According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about United States trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. A review by the Economist of Irwin's 2017 book Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy notes: > Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the > economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for > tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them > again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving > the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated > the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism > made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer > lessons for developing countries today.

In > some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But > American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its > abundant resources and openness to people and ideas. According to Paul Bairoch, since the end of the 18th century the United States has been \\"the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism\\". In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the Jeffersonians strongly opposed it. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Alexander Hamilton's themes within the Whig Party under the name American System. The opposition Democratic Party contested several elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry.Larry Schweikart, What Would the Founders Say? (New York: Sentinel, 2011), pp. 106‚Äì124. The Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries. The economist Henry Charles Carey became a leading proponent of the American System of economics. This mercantilist American System was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. The fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a \\"Henry Clay tariff Whig\\", strongly opposed free trade and implemented a 44% tariff during the Civil War, in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort and in part to protect favored industries. William McKinley (later to become President of the United States) stated the stance of the Republican Party (which won every election for president from 1868 until 1912, except the two non-consecutive terms of Grover Cleveland) as thus: During the interwar period, economic protectionism took hold in the United States, most famously in the form of the Smoot‚ÄìHawley Tariff Act which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression. From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.  Post-World War II  Since the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The United States helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later the World Trade Organization, although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s, the International Trade Organization.http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/reser_e/pera9707.pdf Since the 1970s, United States governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006 and a number of bilateral agreements (such as with Jordan). In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union in 1993. The European Union, now the world's largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world.  Modern era  Singapore is the top country in the Enabling Trade Index Most countries in the world are members of the World Trade Organization which limits in certain ways but does not eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. Most countries are also members of regional free trade areas that lower trade barriers among participating countries. The European Union and the United States are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Initially led by the United States, twelve countries that have borders on the Pacific Ocean are currently in private negotiations around the Trans-Pacific Partnership which is being touted by the negotiating countries as a free trade policy. In January 2017, President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. = Degree of free trade policies = Free trade may apply to trade in services as well as in goods. Non-economic considerations may inhibit free trade as a country may espouse free trade in principle, but ban certain drugs (such as alcohol) or certain practices (such as prostitution)Compare: and limiting international free trade. Some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world. Most developed nations maintain controversial agricultural tariffs. From 1820 to 1980, the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from 11 to 32%. In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%.Chang (2003), Kicking Away the Ladder, p. 66 The American economist C. Fred Bergsten devised the bicycle theory to describe trade policy. According to this model, trade policy is dynamically unstable in that it constantly tends towards either liberalisation or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and multilateral trade negotiations must constantly pedal towards greater liberalisation. To achieve greater liberalisation, decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work as this will both reduce the backlash against globalisation and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.Destler, Mac and Noland, Marcus (July 2, 2014). Constant Ends, Flexible Means: C. Fred Bergsten and the Quest for Open Trade. Peterson Institute for International Economics. George W. Bush and Hu Jintao of China meet while attending an APEC summit in Santiago de Chile, 2004 In Kicking Away the Ladder, development economist Ha- Joon Chang reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth and notes that many of the now-industrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history. The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the Corn Laws which restricted import of grain in 1846 in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for manufactures only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40‚Äì50% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century.Chang (2003), Kicking Away the Ladder, p. 17 The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands and to a lesser degree Belgium.Chang (2003), Kicking Away the Ladder, p. 59 Chang describes the export-oriented industrialization policies of the Four Asian Tigers as \\"far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents\\".Chang (2003), Kicking Away the Ladder, p. 50  Free trade in goods  The Global Enabling Trade Report measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destinations. The index summarizes four sub- indexes, namely market access; border administration; transport and communications infrastructure; and business environment. As of 2016, the top 30 countries and areas were the following:\\"Global Enabling Trade Index\\".  Politics  Academics, governments and interest groups debate the relative costs, benefits and beneficiaries of free trade. Arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category (trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy) or into the moral category (the effects of trade might help the economy, but have ill effects in other areas). A general argument against free trade is that it represents colonialism or imperialism in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns about:Boudreaux, Don Globalization, 2007 * destroying infant industries * undermining long-run economic development * promoting income inequality * tolerating environmental degradation * supporting child labor and sweatshops * race to the bottom * wage slavery * accentuating poverty in poor countries * harming national defense * forcing cultural change The European Union‚ÄìMercosur Free Trade Agreement would form one of the world's largest free trade areas. However, poor countries which have adopted free-trade policies have experienced high economic growth, with China and India as prime examples. Free trade allows companies from rich countries to directly invest in poor countries, sharing their knowledge, providing capital and giving access to markets. Economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories. Sociopolitical arguments against free trade cite social and political effects that economic arguments do not capture, such as political stability, national security, human rights and environmental protection. Some products are important to national security and governments may deem it dangerous to allow domestic producers of these products to go out of business, especially if otherwise they might come to depend on producers who operate in a country that may one day become an enemy. Countries that allow low wages have a competitive advantage in attracting industry, which may lead to a general lowering of wages for workers in all countries. Some countries may facilitate low-cost production of goods in their countries by allowing pollution of the environment: their pricing ignores environmental full-cost accounting and hidden costs are paid by their local, national and international neighbours. Domestic industries often oppose free trade on the grounds that it would lower prices for imported goods would reduce their profits and market share.William Baumol and Alan Blinder, Economics: Principles and Policy, p. 722. For example, if the United States reduced tariffs on imported sugar, sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits, and sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices. The economic theory of David Ricardo holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose.Richard L. Stroup, James D. Gwartney, Russell S. Sobel, Economics: Private and Public Choice, p. 46. Since each of the domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little, domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the reduction in tariffs. More generally, producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets. 500px United States real wages vs. trade as a percent of GDP Socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum exploitation of workers by capital. For example, Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto (1848): \\"The bourgeoisie [...] has set up that single, unconscionable freedom ‚Äì free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation\\". Marx supported free trade, however, solely because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution.\\"It is in this revolutionary sense alone, gentlemen, that I vote in favor of free trade.\\" Marx, Karl On the Question of Free Trade Speech to the Democratic Association of Brussels at its public meeting of January 9, 1848 Many anti-globalization groups oppose free trade based on their assertion that free-trade agreements generally do not increase the economic freedom of the poor or of the working class and frequently make them poorer. Some opponents of free trade favor free-trade theory, but oppose free-trade agreements as applied. Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as materially harming the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade per se. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the United States into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost (dumping) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers. Indeed, such subsidies violate free- trade theory, so this argument is not actually against the principle of free trade, but rather against its selective implementation. Research shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education. Hainmueller and Hiscox find > \\"that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and > globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information > about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena, than it > does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or > job security. This is not to say that the latter types of calculations are > not important in shaping individuals' views of trade ‚Äì just that they are > not being manifest in the simple association between education and support > for trade openness\\". A 2017 study found that individuals whose occupations are routine-task- intensive and who do jobs that are offshorable are more likely to favor protectionism. Research suggests that attitudes towards free trade do not necessarily reflect individuals' self-interests.  Colonialism  Map of colonial empires in 1945 Various proponents of economic nationalism and of the school of mercantilism have long portrayed free trade as a form of colonialism or imperialism. In the 19th century, such groups criticized British calls for free trade as cover for British Empire, notably in the works of American Henry Clay, architect of the American System\\"Gentlemen deceive themselves. It is not free trade that they are recommending to our acceptance. It is, in effect, the British colonial system that we are invited to adopt; and, if their policy prevail, it will lead, substantially, to the recolonization of these States, under the commercial dominion of Great Britain.\\", \\"In Defense of the American System, Against the British Colonial System.\\" 1832, Feb 2, 3, and 6, and of the German-American economist Friedrich List (1789-1846).\\"Had the English left everything to itself ‚Äì 'Laissez faire, laissez aller', as the popular economical school recommends ‚Äì the [German] merchants of the Steelyard would be still carrying on their trade in London, the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English, England would have still continued to be the sheep-farm of the Hansards, just as Portugal became the vineyard of England, and has remained so till our days, owing to the stratagem of a cunning diplomatist.\\" Free-trade debates and associated matters involving the colonial administration of Ireland have periodically (such as in 1846 and 1906) caused ructions in the British Conservative (Tory) Party (Corn Law issues in the 1820s to the 1840s, Irish Home Rule issues throughout the 19th and early-20th centuries). Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa (in office from 2007 to 2017) denounced the \\"sophistry of free trade\\" in an introduction he wrote for a 2006 book,The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords, El rostro oculto del TLC which was written in part by Correa's Energy Minister Alberto Acosta. Citing as his source the 2002 book Kicking Away the Ladder written by Ha-Joon Chang, Correa identified the difference between an \\"American system\\" opposed to a \\"British System\\" of free trade. The Americans explicitly viewed the latter, he says, as \\"part of the British imperialist system\\". According to Correa, Chang showed that Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton (in office 1789-1795), rather than List, first presented a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism.  Major free trade areas   Africa   Europe   Americas   Alternatives  The following alternatives to free trade have been proposed: protectionism, imperialism, balanced trade, fair trade, and industrial policy.  In literature  The value of free trade was first observed and documented in 1776 by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, writing:Bhagwati (2002), Free Trade Today, p. 3 This statement uses the concept of absolute advantage to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism, the dominant view surrounding trade at the time which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports and thus amass wealth.Pugel (2007), International Economics, p. 33 Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the goods in which they are most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. However, the concept of absolute advantage does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.Pugel (2007), International Economics, p. 34 This theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to David Ricardo, who expanded on it in his 1817 book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,Ricardo (1817), On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, Chapter 7 \\"On Foreign Trade\\" it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good, but on the relative opportunity costs of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky.Bhagwati (2002), Free Trade Today, p. 1Pugel (2007), International Economics, pp. 35‚Äì38, 40 Exceptionally, Henry George's 1886 book Protection or Free Trade was read out loud in full into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen.Weir, \\"A Fragile Alliance,\\" 425‚Äì425Henry George, Protection or Free Trade: An Examination of the Tariff Question, with Especial Regard to the Interests of Labor(New York: 1887). American economist Tyler Cowen wrote that Protection or Free Trade \\"remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day\\". Although George is very critical towards protectionism, he discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor: > We all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by > water or land; we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals, the > building of railways, the deepening of harbors, the improvement of > steamships as beneficial. But if such things are beneficial, how can tariffs > be beneficial? The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of > transporting commodities; the effect of tariffs is to increase it. If the > protective theory be true, every improvement that cheapens the carriage of > goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be > commensurately increased.\\"True Free Trade\\", Chapter 3, Protection or Free > Trade George considers the general free trade argument inadequate. He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class, unless accompanied by a shift towards land value tax.

Early life, musical career  She was born in London, the daughter of Mary and Valentine Snow, who was the sergeant-trumpeter to George II. As a child, she was trained by her father for a future musical career. Mrs Baddeley in the role of Joan of Arc At the age of eighteen she eloped with the actor Robert Baddeley, then on the stage at Drury Lane. She made her first appearance on 27 April 1765, as Ophelia in Hamlet. She also played Cordelia in King Lear, Imogen in Cymbeline and later Olivia in Twelfth Night. In 1769, she joined David Garrick's theatre company when he staged the Stratford Jubilee. In that year she appeared in a Royal Command Performance of The Clandestine Marriage on the 12 October. She appeared as Fanny Sterling with Robert as Canton and Thomas King as Lord Ogleby. These three were painted in that role by Johan Zoffany and the painting is now owned by the Garrick Club. Baddeley was noted as a talented singer rather than as an actress, she obtained engagements at Ranelegh and Vauxhall to public acclaim.  Life as a courtesan  At the height of her success and after separating from her husband in 1770, she discovered that she could sustain herself financially by finding wealthy benefactors, establishing herself as a courtesan to them. Probably her best-known lover was Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne. She was famous for her beauty, and was also noted for her extravagant lifestyle. Her overspending and ultimate failure in managing her finances eventually obliged her to take refuge from her creditors in Dublin, Ireland and later Edinburgh, Scotland. Her benefactors gone, and her own health in decline, she made her last appearance on the stage in Edinburgh in 1785. She died of consumption, aged 41, the following year.Free Library: \\"The Sentimental Satire of Sophia Baddeley\\".

Traditionally, customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties (i.e. tariffs) and other taxes on import and export. In recent decades, the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues: taxation, security, and trade facilitation. Each country has its own laws and regulations for the import and export of goods into and out of a country, enforced by their respective customs authorities; the import/export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden entirely. A wide range of penalties are faced by those who break these laws.  Overview  Officers from US Customs and Border Protection boarding a ship  Trade and taxation  A customs duty is a tariff or tax on the importation (usually) or exportation (unusually) of goods. Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are held in a customs area, often called a bonded store, until processed. All authorized ports are recognized customs areas. Trade facilitation objectives were introduced into routine of customs authorities in order to reduce trade transaction costs. The contemporary understanding of the ‚Äútrade facilitation‚Äù concept is based on the Recommendation No. 4 of UN/CEFACT ‚ÄúNational Trade Facilitation Bodies‚Äù. According to its provisions (para. 14), > facilitation covers formalities, procedures, documents and operations > related to international trade transactions. Its goals are simplification, > harmonization and standardization, so that transactions become easier, > faster and more economical than before.  Security  The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States has become the cardinal factor in prompting a significant strengthening of the security component of modern customs operations, after which security-oriented control measures for supply chains have been widely implemented for the aims of preventing risk identification. At airports today, customs functions as the point of no return for all passengers; once passengers have cleared customs, they cannot go back. Anyone arriving at an airport must also clear customs before they can officially enter a country. Those who breach the law will be detained by customs and likely returned to their original location. The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by migration authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements. Immigration authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants, and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country. The most complete guidelines for customs security functions implementation is provided in the World Customs Organization Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE), which has had five editions in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2018, respectively. Customs as a public service Customs are a public service provided by the government of the respective country that collects the duties levied on imported goods as well as providing security measures through which people enter and exit the country. A public good/service is defined by being non-rival and non- excludable. One cannot avoid customs when exiting or entering a country thus making it non-excludable. There is some congestion when going through airports, with the average wait time in customs in American Domestic airports being 75.1 minutes, however, the congestion doesn't discriminate based on rival-consumption thus making it a public service. Privatization of customs The customs-and-duty house at the port of Haifa, Israel Customs is part of one of the three basic functions of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting pre-shipment inspection agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country's customs is obliged to accept the agency's report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry. While engaging a pre-shipment inspection agency may appear justified in a country with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure has not been able to plug the loophole and protect revenue. It has been found that evasion of customs duty escalated when pre-shipment agencies took over.Chowdhury, F. L. (2006) Corrupt bureaucracy and privatization of Customs in Bangladesh, Pathok Samabesh, Dhaka. It has also been alleged that involvement of such agencies has caused shipping delays. Chowdhury, F. L. (1992) Evasion of Customs Duty in Bangladesh, unpublished MBA dissertation submitted to Monash University, Australia. Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy. In many countries, import and export data are issued on the basis of national laws (Transparency Laws / Freedom of Information Act). There has, however, been some speed bumps when transitioning customs over from the public to private sector. Factors such as an incompetent private sector, government's reluctance to change the traditional roles of customs, neglecting priority-setting and lack of transparency in the transition process have slowed the rate at which the public to private transition has taken place.  Red and green channels  Customs control zone at Sheremetyevo International Airport, Moscow Oblast, February 2019 In many countries, customs procedures for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels. Passengers with goods to declare (carrying goods above the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel. Passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, if a passenger going through the green channel is found to be carrying goods above the customs limits or prohibited items, he or she may be prosecuted for making a false declaration to customs, by virtue of having gone through the green channel. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States do not officially operate a red and green channel system; however, some airports copy this layout. Blue channel Airports in EU countries such as Finland, Ireland or the United Kingdom, also have a blue channel. As the EU is a customs union, travellers between EU countries do not have to pay customs duties. Value-added tax and excise duties may be applicable if the goods are subsequently sold, but these are collected when the goods are sold, not at the border. Passengers arriving from other EU countries go through the blue channel, where they may still be subject to checks for prohibited or restricted goods. Luggage tickets for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified. In most EU member states, travellers coming from other EU countries can simply use the green lane. Red point phone All airports in the United Kingdom operate a channel system, however some don't have a red channel, they instead have a red point phone which serves the same purpose. Summary of basic custom rules Europe The basic customs law is harmonized across Europe within the European Union Customs Union. This includes customs duties and restrictions. Customs tax from ‚Ç¨22 to ‚Ç¨150. In addition, see regulations of each member state. For customs declarations in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, the \\"Single Administrative Document\\" (SAD) is used as a basis. =Germany= Up to ‚Ç¨22, there are no taxes. From ‚Ç¨22 up to ‚Ç¨150, it is necessary to pay VAT (EUSt in Germany), which is 7% or 19% depending on the goods. From ‚Ç¨150 it is necessary to pay VAT and customs. =Romania= Customs may be very strict, especially for goods shipped from anywhere outside the EU. Up to ‚Ç¨10 goods/package. =Italy= Customs in Italy takes additional 22% VAT (Value-added tax) for goods imported from outside the European Union even if the VAT is already paid to the origin country sender. =Czech Republic and Slovakia= Up to ‚Ç¨22, there are no taxes. From ‚Ç¨22 up to ‚Ç¨150, it is necessary to pay VAT (DPH in Czech/Slovak), which is 21%. From ‚Ç¨150, it is necessary to pay VAT and customs. Customs may range from zero to 10% depending on the type of imported goods. = Ukraine = Ukraine has had 5 reforms of its customs authorities. The recent one, in 2019, reorganized State Fiscal Service into the State Customs Service. The reform attempt seeks to digitize customs procedures, get market-level wages, innovate customs checkpoints, integrate into EU customs community, open reference database of customs inspections.5 STEPS TOWARDS TRANSPARENT CUSTOMS SERVICE, BY MAX NEFYODOV The Americas =United States= Every person arriving in the US is subject to inspection by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers for compliance with immigration, customs and agriculture regulations. This public service is administered on almost a million visitors who enter the US daily. Travelers are screened for a number of prohibited items including; gold, alcoholic beverages, firearms and soil. A wide range of penalties face those non-compliers. The United States imposes tariffs or \\"customs duties\\" on imports of goods, being 3% on average. The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the importer of record. Individuals arriving in the United States may be exempt from duty on a limited amount of purchases, and on goods temporarily imported (such as laptop computers) under the ATA Carnet system. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product, with duties ranging from zero to 81% of the value of the goods. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and civil and criminal penalties against involved parties. The CBP enforces customs rules. All goods entering the United States are subject to inspection by CBP prior to legal entry. =Uruguay= Uruguayan Customs place a cap on the importation of personal packages to up to 3 packages of a nominal value of no more than $200 USD which can be entered into the country without extra charge. For a package to be included in the 3 free slots, the addressee must register the package with the Uruguayan Postal Service linking the tracking code, their address, national ID number phone and email address. Should a package arrive prior to registration the package must pay the 60% tax and no less than $10 USD. Any personal package worth more than $200 USD or after the 3 free packages, must pay a 60% tax. This severely limits the public's ability to buy products online. Due to Uruguay's small population and market, many popular and specialty products are unavailable in the regular marketplace, forcing Uruguayans to strategically pool several purchases together and max each one of their free slots. =Argentina= Customs may be very strict. Goods valued up to $500 USD brought in by plane and up to $300 USD by sea or land are free of duties and taxes, cellphones and laptop computers are duty free regardless of their value only one per passenger, clothing and other personal use items are free of taxes. Above those values, tax is 50% of the value of all acquired goods summed up.  International Customs Day  Customs, Tolls or Duties of the Corporation of Kinsale (1788)International Customs Day recognizes the role of agencies and customs officials in maintaining border security around the world. In focuses on the workers and their working conditions as well as the challenges that some customs officers face in their job. Custom agencies hold employee appreciation events where custom officers are recognized for their work. Several agencies also hold events for the public where they explain their jobs and responsibilities in a transparent manner. Each year, at the end of January is celebrated the International Customs Day with a particular theme, as follows: * 2019, the chosen theme was 'SMART borders for seamless Trade, Travel and Transport'. * 2018, the chosen theme was 'A secure business environment for economic development'. * Chosen theme for previous editions 2009 - 2018.

In elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is a formula that provides the solution(s) to a quadratic equation. There are other ways of solving a quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as factoring (direct factoring, grouping, AC method), completing the square, graphing and others. Given a general quadratic equation of the form :ax^2+bx+c=0 with representing an unknown, , and representing constants with , the quadratic formula is: :x = \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ where the plus-minus symbol \\"¬±\\" indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions. Written separately, they become: : x_1=\\\\frac{-b + \\\\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad x_2=\\\\frac{-b - \\\\sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a} Each of these two solutions is also called a root (or zero) of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, these roots represent the -values at which any parabola, explicitly given as , crosses the -axis. As well as being a formula that yields the zeros of any parabola, the quadratic formula can also be used to identify the axis of symmetry of the parabola, and the number of real zeros the quadratic equation contains. Equivalent formulations The quadratic formula may also be written as: :x = \\\\frac{-b}{2a} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} \\\\ \\\\ , which may be simplified to: :x = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{2a}\\\\right) \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{2a}\\\\right)^2-\\\\frac{c}{a}} \\\\ \\\\ . This version of the formula is convenient when complex roots are involved, in which case the expression outside the square root will be the real part‚Äîand the square root expression the imaginary part. The expression inside the square root is a discriminant. Muller's method A lesser known quadratic formula, which is used in Muller's method and which can be found from Vieta's formulas, provides the same roots via the equation: :x=\\\\frac{-2c}{b\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}} = \\\\frac{2c}{-b \\\\mp \\\\sqrt {b^2-4ac\\\\ }}\\\\ \\\\ . Formulations based on alternative parametrizations The standard parametrization of the quadratic equation is :ax^2+bx+c=0\\\\ \\\\ . Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as : ax^2 - 2b_1 x + c = 0, where b_1 = -b/2, or : ax^2 + 2b_2 x + c = 0, where b_2 = b/2. These alternative parametrizations result in slightly different forms for the solution, but which are otherwise equivalent to the standard parametrization.  Derivations of the formula Many different methods to derive the quadratic formula are available in the literature. The standard one is a simple application of the completing the square technique., Chapter 13 ¬ß4.4, p. 291Li, Xuhui. An Investigation of Secondary School Algebra Teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Algebraic Equation Solving, p. 56 (ProQuest, 2007): \\"The quadratic formula is the most general method for solving quadratic equations and is derived from another general method: completing the square.\\"Rockswold, Gary. College algebra and trigonometry and precalculus, p. 178 (Addison Wesley, 2002).Beckenbach, Edwin et al. Modern college algebra and trigonometry, p. 81 (Wadsworth Pub. Co., 1986). Alternative methods are sometimes simpler than completing the square, and may offer interesting insight into other areas of mathematics. By using the 'completing the square' technique =Standard method= Divide the quadratic equation by a, which is allowed because a is non-zero: :x^2 + \\\\frac{b}{a} x + \\\\frac{c}{a}=0\\\\ \\\\ . Subtract from both sides of the equation, yielding: :x^2 + \\\\frac{b}{a} x= -\\\\frac{c}{a}\\\\ \\\\ . The quadratic equation is now in a form to which the method of completing the square is applicable. In fact, by adding a constant to both sides of the equation such that the left hand side becomes a complete square, the quadratic equation becomes: :x^2+\\\\frac{b}{a}x+\\\\left( \\\\frac{b}{2a} \\\\right)^2 =-\\\\frac{c}{a}+\\\\left( \\\\frac{b}{2a} \\\\right)^2\\\\ \\\\ , which produces: :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{b}{2a}\\\\right)^2=-\\\\frac{c}{a}+\\\\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\\\\ \\\\ . Accordingly, after rearranging the terms on the right hand side to have a common denominator, we obtain: :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{b}{2a}\\\\right)^2=\\\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\\\ \\\\ . The square has thus been completed. Taking the square root of both sides yields the following equation: :x+\\\\frac{b}{2a}=\\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\\\ }}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . In which case, isolating the x would give the quadratic formula: :x=\\\\frac{-b\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\\\ }}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . There are many alternatives of this derivation with minor differences, mostly concerning the manipulation of a. =Method 2= The majority of algebra texts published over the last several decades teach completing the square using the sequence presented earlier: # Divide each side by a to make the polynomial monic. # Rearrange. # Add \\\\textstyle \\\\left( \\\\frac{b}{2a} \\\\right)^2 to both sides to complete the square. # Rearrange the terms in the right side to have a common denominator. # Take the square root of both sides. # Isolate x. Completing the square can also be accomplished by a sometimes shorter and simpler sequence: # Multiply each side by 4a, # Rearrange. # Add b^2 to both sides to complete the square. # Take the square root of both sides. # Isolate x. In which case, the quadratic formula can also be derived as follows: :\\\\begin{align} ax^2+bx+c &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + 4ac &= 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx &= -4ac \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + b^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\\\\\\\\\\\ (2ax + b)^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2ax + b &= \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2ax &= -b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\\\\\\\\\\\ x &= \\\\frac{-b\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac }}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . \\\\end{align} This derivation of the quadratic formula is ancient and was known in India at least as far back as 1025. Compared with the derivation in standard usage, this alternate derivation avoids fractions and squared fractions until the last step and hence does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side. =Method 3= Similar to Method 1, divide each side by a to make left-hand-side polynomial monic (i.e., the coefficient of x^2 becomes 1). :x^2 + \\\\frac{b}{a} x + \\\\frac{c}{a}=0\\\\ \\\\ . Write the equation in a more compact and easier-to-handle format: :x^2 + Bx + C = 0 where \\\\textstyle B = \\\\frac{b}{a} and \\\\textstyle C = \\\\frac{c}{a}. Complete the square by adding \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{B^2}{4} to the first two terms and subtracting it from the third term: :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{B}{2}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left( C - \\\\frac{B^2}{4}\\\\right) = 0 Rearrange the left side into a difference of two squares: :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{B}{2}\\\\right)^2 - \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\\\right)^2 = 0 and factor it: :\\\\left(x+\\\\frac{B}{2} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\\\right) \\\\left(x+\\\\frac{B}{2} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\\\right) = 0 which implies that either :x+\\\\frac{B}{2} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0 or :x+\\\\frac{B}{2} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0 Each of these two equations is linear and can be solved for x, obtaining: > x = -\\\\frac{B}{2} - \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} or x = -\\\\frac{B}{2} + > \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} By re-expressing B and C back into \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{b}{a} and \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{c}{a}, respectively, the quadratic formula can then be obtained. By substitution Another technique is solution by substitution.Joseph J. Rotman. (2010). Advanced modern algebra (Vol. 114). American Mathematical Soc. Section 1.1 In this technique, we substitute x = y+m into the quadratic to get: :a(y+m)^2 + b(y+m) + c =0\\\\ \\\\ . Expanding the result and then collecting the powers of y produces: :ay^2 + y(2am + b) + \\\\left(am^2+bm+c\\\\right) = 0\\\\ \\\\ . We have not yet imposed a second condition on y and m, so we now choose m so that the middle term vanishes. That is, 2am + b = 0 or \\\\textstyle m = \\\\frac{-b}{2a}. Subtracting the constant term from both sides of the equation (to move it to the right hand side) and then dividing by a gives: :y^2=\\\\frac{-\\\\left(am^2+bm+c\\\\right)}{a}\\\\ \\\\ . Substituting for m gives: :y^2=\\\\frac{-\\\\left(\\\\frac{b^2}{4a}+\\\\frac{-b^2}{2a}+c\\\\right)}{a}=\\\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\\\ \\\\ . Therefore, :y=\\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} By re-expressing y in terms of x using the formula \\\\textstyle x = y + m = y - \\\\frac{b}{2a} , the usual quadratic formula can then be obtained: :x = \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . By using algebraic identities The following method was used by many historical mathematicians: Let the roots of the standard quadratic equation be and . The derivation starts by recalling the identity: :(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2\\\\ \\\\ . Taking the square root on both sides, we get: :r_1 - r_2 = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2}\\\\ \\\\ . Since the coefficient , we can divide the standard equation by to obtain a quadratic polynomial having the same roots. Namely, : x^2 + \\\\frac{b}{a}x + \\\\frac{c}{a} = (x - r_1)(x-r_2) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2\\\\ \\\\ . From this we can see that the sum of the roots of the standard quadratic equation is given by , and the product of those roots is given by . Hence the identity can be rewritten as: :r_1 - r_2 = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(-\\\\frac{b}{a}\\\\right)^2-4\\\\frac{c}{a}} = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{b^2}{a^2} - \\\\frac{4ac}{a^2}} = \\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{a}\\\\ \\\\ . Now, :r_1 = \\\\frac{(r_1 + r_2) + (r_1 - r_2)}{2} = \\\\frac{-\\\\frac{b}{a} \\\\pm \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}}{2} = \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . Since , if we take :r_1 = \\\\frac{-b + \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} then we obtain :r_2 = \\\\frac{-b - \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ ; and if we instead take :r_1 = \\\\frac{-b - \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} then we calculate that :r_2 = \\\\frac{-b + \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . Combining these results by using the standard shorthand ¬±, we have that the solutions of the quadratic equation are given by: : x = \\\\frac{-b \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . By Lagrange resolvents An alternative way of deriving the quadratic formula is via the method of Lagrange resolvents,Clark, A. (1984). Elements of abstract algebra. Courier Corporation. p. 146. which is an early part of Galois theory., ¬ß6.2, p. 134 This method can be generalized to give the roots of cubic polynomials and quartic polynomials, and leads to Galois theory, which allows one to understand the solution of algebraic equations of any degree in terms of the symmetry group of their roots, the Galois group. This approach focuses on the roots more than on rearranging the original equation. Given a monic quadratic polynomial :x^2+px+q\\\\ \\\\ , assume that it factors as :x^2+px+q=(x-\\\\alpha)(x-\\\\beta)\\\\ \\\\ , Expanding yields :x^2+px+q=x^2-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)x+\\\\alpha \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\ , where and . Since the order of multiplication does not matter, one can switch and and the values of and will not change: one can say that and are symmetric polynomials in and . In fact, they are the elementary symmetric polynomials ‚Äì any symmetric polynomial in and can be expressed in terms of and The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is: given the coefficients of a polynomial, which are symmetric functions in the roots, can one \\"break the symmetry\\" and recover the roots? Thus solving a polynomial of degree is related to the ways of rearranging (\\"permuting\\") terms, which is called the symmetric group on letters, and denoted . For the quadratic polynomial, the only way to rearrange two terms is to swap them (\\"transpose\\" them), and thus solving a quadratic polynomial is simple. To find the roots and , consider their sum and difference: :\\\\begin{align} r_1 &= \\\\alpha + \\\\beta\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_2 &= \\\\alpha - \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\ . \\\\end{align} These are called the Lagrange resolvents of the polynomial; notice that one of these depends on the order of the roots, which is the key point. One can recover the roots from the resolvents by inverting the above equations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha &= \\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left(r_1+r_2\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta &= \\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left(r_1-r_2\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\ . \\\\end{align} Thus, solving for the resolvents gives the original roots. Now is a symmetric function in and , so it can be expressed in terms of and , and in fact as noted above. But is not symmetric, since switching and yields (formally, this is termed a group action of the symmetric group of the roots). Since is not symmetric, it cannot be expressed in terms of the coefficients and , as these are symmetric in the roots and thus so is any polynomial expression involving them. Changing the order of the roots only changes by a factor of ‚àí1, and thus the square is symmetric in the roots, and thus expressible in terms of and . Using the equation :(\\\\alpha - \\\\beta)^2 = (\\\\alpha + \\\\beta)^2 - 4\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\ \\\\ yields :r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q\\\\ \\\\ and thus :r_2 = \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\\\ \\\\ If one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains: :\\\\begin{align} r_1 &= -p\\\\\\\\\\\\ r_2 &= \\\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q} \\\\end{align} and thus :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha &= \\\\tfrac12\\\\left(-p+\\\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\beta &= \\\\tfrac12\\\\left(-p-\\\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\ . \\\\end{align} Thus the roots are :\\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{1}{2}}\\\\left(-p \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\\\right) which is the quadratic formula. Substituting yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as being the vertex, and is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial). A similar but more complicated method works for cubic equations, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the \\"resolving polynomial\\") relating and , which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a quartic equation (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved. The same method for a quintic equation yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots. Historical development The earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems reducible to solving quadratic equations. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation. The Greek mathematician Euclid (circa 300 BC) used geometric methods to solve quadratic equations in Book 2 of his Elements, an influential mathematical treatise. Rules for quadratic equations appear in the Chinese The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art circa 200 BC. In his work Arithmetica, the Greek mathematician Diophantus (circa 250 AD) solved quadratic equations with a method more recognizably algebraic than the geometric algebra of Euclid. His solution gives only one root, even when both roots are positive. The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (597‚Äì668 AD) explicitly described the quadratic formula in his treatise BrƒÅhmasphu·π≠asiddhƒÅnta published in 628 AD,Bradley, Michael. The Birth of Mathematics: Ancient Times to 1300, p. 86 (Infobase Publishing 2006). but written in words instead of symbols.Mackenzie, Dana. The Universe in Zero Words: The Story of Mathematics as Told through Equations, p. 61 (Princeton University Press, 2012). His solution of the quadratic equation was as follows: \\"To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value.\\" This is equivalent to: :x = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{4ac+b^2}-b}{2a}\\\\ \\\\ . The 9th-century Persian mathematician Mu·∏•ammad ibn M≈´sƒÅ al-KhwƒÅrizmƒ´ solved quadratic equations algebraically. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 Ren√© Descartes published La G√©om√©trie containing special cases of the quadratic formula in the form we know today. Significant uses Geometric significance In terms of coordinate geometry, a parabola is a curve whose -coordinates are described by a second- degree polynomial, i.e. any equation of the form: :y =p(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x +a_0\\\\ \\\\ , where represents the polynomial of degree 2 and and are constant coefficients whose subscripts correspond to their respective term's degree. The geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula is that it defines the points on the -axis where the parabola will cross the axis. Additionally, if the quadratic formula was looked at as two terms, :x = \\\\frac{-b\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\\\ }}{2a}=-\\\\frac{b}{2a} \\\\pm\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\\\ }}{2a} the axis of symmetry appears as the line . The other term, , gives the distance the zeros are away from the axis of symmetry, where the plus sign represents the distance to the right, and the minus sign represents the distance to the left. If this distance term were to decrease to zero, the value of the axis of symmetry would be the value of the only zero, that is, there is only one possible solution to the quadratic equation. Algebraically, this means that , or simply (where the left-hand side is referred to as the discriminant). This is one of three cases, where the discriminant indicates how many zeros the parabola will have. If the discriminant is positive, the distance would be non-zero, and there will be two solutions. However, there is also the case where the discriminant is less than zero, and this indicates the distance will be imaginary or some multiple of the complex unit , where and the parabola's zeros will be complex numbers.

Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh. Gulf's former headquarters, originally referred to as \\"the Gulf Building\\" (now the Gulf Tower office condos), is an Art Deco skyscraper. The tallest building in Pittsburgh until 1970, when it was eclipsed by the U.S. Steel Tower, it is capped by a step pyramid structure several stories high. Until 1973, the entire top was illuminated, changing color with changes in barometric pressure to provide a weather indicator that could be seen for many miles. After 1973 until the 2000s, only a beacon on top would change colors. Gulf Oil Corporation (GOC) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both re-branding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf's main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro-Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia & York.Gulf Canada Resources, Canadian Encyclopedia article. Retrieved 2014-07-30 However, the Gulf brand name and a number of the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf has experienced a significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies. Gulf, in its present incarnation, is a \\"new economy\\" business. It employs very few people directly and its assets are mainly in the form of intellectual property: brands, product specifications and scientific expertise. The rights to the brand in the United States are owned by Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLC), which operates over 2,100 service stations and several petroleum terminals; it is headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. The corporate vehicle at the center of the Gulf network outside the United States, Spain and Portugal is Gulf Oil International, a company owned by the Hinduja Group. The company's focus is primarily in the provision of downstream products and services to a mass market through joint ventures, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, and distribution arrangement.GOI website: ‚Äì extract from Gulf Oil mission statement In Spain and Portugal, the Gulf brand is now owned by Total S.A.  History  1901‚Äì1982 Early Gulf logo c. 1920 The business that became Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas. A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery at nearby Port Arthur to process the oil. The largest investors were Andrew Mellon and William Larimer Mellon Sr., of the Pittsburgh Mellon family. Other investors included many of Mellon's Pennsylvania clients as well as some Texas wildcatters. Mellon Bank and Gulf Oil remained closely associated thereafter. The Gulf Oil Corporation itself was formed in 1907 through the amalgamation of a number of oil businesses, principally the J.M. Guffey Petroleum Company, Gulf Pipeline Company, and Gulf Refining companies of Texas.Handbook of Texas: Early history of Gulf Oil The name of the company refers to the Gulf of Mexico where Beaumont lies. 1922 newspaper ad for a new Gulf station in Philadelphia, with a close view of the station Output from Spindletop peaked at around just after it was discovered and then started to decline.Gulf Oil official 50th anniversary history publication, (1967), p4 Later discoveries made 1927 the peak year of Spindletop production,Handbook of Texas: Spindletop Oilfield but Spindletop's early decline forced Gulf to seek alternative sources of supply to sustain its substantial investment in refining capacity. This was achieved by constructing the 400-mile (640-km) Glenn Pool pipeline connecting oilfields in Oklahoma with Gulf's refinery at Port Arthur. The pipeline opened in September 1907. Gulf later built a network of pipelines and refineries in the eastern and southern United States, requiring heavy capital investment. Thus, Gulf Oil provided Mellon Bank with a secure vehicle for investing in the oil sector.Handbook of Texas: see para 1 Gulf promoted the concept of branded product sales by selling gasoline in containers and from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded gasoline could be assured of its quality and consistent standard.Gulfoil Historical Society: early Gulf gas pumps (In the early 20th century, non-branded gasoline in the United States was often contaminated or of unreliable quality). Gulf Oil grew steadily in the inter-war years, with its activities mainly confined to the United States. The company was characterized by its vertically integrated business activities, and was active across the whole spectrum of the oil industry: exploration, production, transport, refining and marketing. It also involved itself in associated industries such as petrochemicals and automobile component manufacturing. It introduced significant commercial and technical innovations, including the first drive-in service station (1913), complimentary road maps, drilling over water at Ferry Lake, and the catalytic cracking refining process (Gulf installed the world's first commercial catalytic cracking unit at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery complex in 1951). Gulf also established the model for the integrated, international \\"oil major\\", which refers to one of a group of very large companies that assumed influential and sensitive positions in the countries in which they operated. In 1924 had acquired the Venezuelan-American Creole Syndicate's leases in the strip of shallow water 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) wide along the Lake Maracaibo east shore. In Colombia, Gulf purchased the Barco oil concession in 1926. The government of Colombia revoked the concession the same year, but after much negotiation Gulf won it back in 1931. However, during a period of over- capacity, Gulf was more interested in holding the reserve than developing it. In 1936 Gulf sold Barco to the Texas Corporation, now Texaco, and they would eventually all merge together as Chevron. Gulf had extensive exploration and production operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and Kuwait. The company played a major role in the early development of oil production in Kuwait, and through the 1950s and '60s apparently enjoyed a \\"special relationship\\" with the Kuwaiti government.US Department of State Briefing Paper: Kuwait, 1994 ‚Äì see section on Oil This special relationship attracted unfavorable attention since it was associated with \\"political contributions\\" (see below) and support for anti-democratic politics, as evidenced by papers taken from the body of a Gulf executive killed in the crash of a TWA aircraft at Cairo in 1950.GOC memo 1950: GOC internal appreciation of the Kuwait government Jasper, Tennessee, 1939 In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was formed as a joint venture by British Petroleum, then called the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC), and Gulf. Both APOC and Gulf held equal shares in the venture.KOC: history of Gulf involvement in KOC KOC pioneered the exploration for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938 but it was not until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1. While serving as General Manager and Vice President of Gulf Oil, Willard F. Jones facilitated the expansion of crude oil import from Kuwait, a nation that was - at the time - a yet incipient supply region to the United States. This expansion program implemented by Robert E. Garret and Jones consisted of construction of a fleet of supertankers and was meant to \\"result in a sharp increase in the processing of crude oil and various petroleum products at a time when the domestic demand for (such) products (was) at an unprecedented peak.\\" Gulf Oil's Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, alkylation area, 1956) Gulf expanded on a worldwide basis from the end of the Second World War. The company leveraged its international drilling experience to other areas of the world, and by mid-1943 had established a presence in the eastern oil fields of Venezuela as Mene Grande Oil Company. Much of the company's retail sales expansion was through the acquisition of privately owned chains of filling stations in various countries, allowing Gulf outlets to sell product (sometimes through \\"matching\\" arrangements) from the oil that it was \\"lifting\\" in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Some of these acquisitions were to prove less than resilient in the face of economic and political developments from the 1970s on. Gulf invested heavily in product technology and developed many specialty products, particularly for application in the maritime and aviation engineering sectors. It was particularly noted for its range of lubricants and greases.American Refining Group publicity statement: 2004 Gulf and ARCO tank farms and tanker docks, Port of Philadelphia, 1973 Gulf Oil reached the peak of its development around 1970. In that year, the company processed of crude daily, held assets worth $6.5 billion ($ billion today), employed 58,000 employees worldwide, and was owned by 163,000 shareholders.Handbook of Texas Online: Gulf Oil In addition to its petroleum marketing interests, Gulf was a major producer of petrochemicals, plastics, and agricultural chemicals. Through its subsidiary, Gulf General Atomic Inc., it was also active in the nuclear energy sector.Handbook of Texas: see para 3 Gulf abandoned its involvement in the nuclear sector after a failed deal to build atomic power plants in Romania in the mid-1970s. In 1974, the Kuwait National Assembly took a 60 percent stake in the equity of KOC with the remaining 40 percent divided equally between BP and Gulf. The Kuwaitis took over the rest of the equity in 1975, giving them full ownership of KOC. This meant that Gulf (EH) had to start supplying its downstream operations in Europe with crude bought on the world market at commercial prices.KOC history: the end of Gulf's involvement in Kuwait The whole GOC(EH) edifice now became highly marginal in an economic sense. Many of the marketing companies that Gulf had established in Europe were never truly viable on a stand-alone basis. In 1976 during the nationalization of Venezuelan oil, the transfer of properties, benefits, equipment of Gulf Oil to PDVSA was carried out without any setback and with full satisfaction on both parts. Gulf was at the forefront of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the Universe Ireland was added to Gulf's tanker fleet. At , this was the largest vessel in the world and incapable of berthing at most normal ports.Scripophily history vignette: see para 11 Gulf also participated in a partnership with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the Betelgeuse, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.Byrne O Cleiregh consultants report: report on Whiddy Island oil terminal In the 1970s, Gulf participated in the development of new oilfields in the UK North Sea and in Cabinda, although these were high-cost operations that never compensated for the loss of Gulf's interest in Kuwait. A mercenary army had to be raised to protect the oil installations in Cabinda during the Angolan civil war.Reformed Theology essay: Gulf/Chevron involvement in Angola The Angolan connection was another \\"special relationship\\" that attracted comment. In the late 1970s, Gulf was effectively funding a Soviet bloc regime in Africa while the US government was attempting to overthrow that regime by supporting the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi. Kingsland, Georgia, 1979 In 1975, several senior Gulf executives, including chairman Bob Dorsey, were implicated in the making of illegal \\"political contributions\\" and were forced to step down from their positions.Vanderbilt Television News Archive: Gulf's Dorsey testifies to Senate Foreign Relations Committee This loss of senior personnel at a critical time in Gulf's fortunes may have had a bearing on the events that followed. Gulf's operations worldwide were struggling financially in the recession of the early 1980s, so Gulf's management devised the \\"Big Jobber\\" strategic realignment in 1981 (along with a program of selective divestments) to maintain viability. The Big Jobber strategy recognized that the day of the integrated, multi-national oil major might be over, since it involved concentrating on those parts of the supply chain where Gulf had a competitive advantage. Marketing and promotions In the late 1930s, Gulf's aviation manager, Maj. Alford J. Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned-up versions of the Grumman F3F Navy fighter, for promotional use by the company. Wearing Gulf Oil company colors and logos, the Grumman G-22 \\"Gulfhawk II\\", registered NR1050, was delivered in December 1936, and in 1938 Maj. Williams flew it on a tour of Europe. A second scavenger pump and five drain lines were added to the engine installation that allowed the aircraft to be flown inverted for up to thirty minutes. This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A second airplane, the Grumman G-32 \\"Gulfhawk III\\", registered NC1051, was delivered on May 6, 1938. Impressed by the Army Air Force in November 1942 for use as a VIP transport and designated a UC-103, it crashed in the southern Florida Everglades in early 1943.Editors, \\"The Corpulent Long Islanders\\", AIR International, Bromley, Kent, UK, March 1976, Volume 10, Number 3, pages 131‚Äì133. Gulf Oil was the primary sponsor for NBC News special events coverage in the 1960s, notably for coverage of the U.S. space program. The company used the connection to its advantage by offering giveaway or promotional items at its stations, including sticker sheets of space mission logos, a paper punch-out lunar module model kit, and a book titled \\"We Came in Peace,\\" containing pictures of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Gulf was also a major sponsor of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, which also aired on NBC. Disney magazines and activity books were often given away with a gas fill-up. Gulf was also noted for its \\"Tourgide\\" road maps. One particularly memorable Gulf advertisement carried by NBC during their coverage of the Apollo missions showed aerial and onboard views of the Universe Ireland with Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers singing \\"Bringin' Home the Oil\\" ‚Äì a tribute to the opening of Gulf's operations in Bantry Bay.YouTube Video: \\"Bringin' home the oil\\" with scene possibly shot at Whiddy, created as a tribute to the original commercial Derek Bell & Jo Siffert at the 1971 Le Mans, parked outside the Hotel de France, Wyer's team base Gulf Oil was most synonymous for its association with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early '70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 is one of the most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film Le Mans, Steve McQueen's character, Michael Delaney, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen's increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme.Wrist Dreams: Tag Heuer's Limited Edition Monaco Gulf In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering. In July 2020, Gulf Oil International announced a multi-year strategic partnership with McLaren. From 1963 to 1980, Gulf Oil had a formal agreement with Holiday Inn, the world's largest lodging chain, for which Holiday Inns in the U.S. and Canada would accept Gulf credit cards for food and lodging. In return, Gulf placed service stations on the premises of many Holiday Inn properties along major U.S. highways to provide one-stop availability for gasoline, auto service, food and lodging. Many older Holiday Inns still have those original Gulf stations on their properties, some in operation and some closed, but few operate today as Gulf stations. Gulf No-Nox gasoline was promoted with a bucking horse leaving an imprint of two horseshoes. Several promotions centered on the two horseshoes. In 1966 bright orange 3-D plastic self-adhesive horseshoes for car bumpers were given away. Another popular giveaway was during the 1968 election season, gold horseshoe lapel pins featuring either a Democratic donkey or a Republican elephant.  Demise  By 1980, Gulf exhibited many of the characteristics of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk. Its undoing as an independent company began in 1982 when T. Boone Pickens,NNDB: outline bio an Amarillo, Texas, oilman and corporate raider (or greenmailer), and owner of Mesa Petroleum, made an offer for the comparatively larger (but still considered \\"non-major\\" oil company) Cities Service Company (more generally known by the name Citgo) from Tulsa, Oklahoma, which was then trading in the low 20s. Pickens first privately offered $45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a $50 a share public offer when Cities' CEO rejected the friendly offer.\\"Texas Style Takeover\\" Time: (June 21, 1982) Gulf forestalled Mesa's takeover attempt by offering $63 a share in a friendly offer which Cities (by then trading at $37) accepted.\\"Upping the Ante\\" Time: (June 28, 1982) Cities then bought out Pickens for $55 a share. Once Pickens was gone, Gulf reneged on its buyout offer, supposedly over a dispute regarding accuracy of Cities Service's reserves, and the stock price of Cities plunged, triggering stockholder lawsuits as well as distrust for Gulf's management on Wall Street and among financing investment banks who bet big in assisting Gulf to defeat Mesa only to be left broke when Gulf backed out. Cities Service was ultimately sold to Occidental Petroleum, and the retail operations were resold to Southland Corporation, the operators of 7-Eleven stores.Financial Management article, 9/2002 Gulf's wealth loss from Cities Services white knight project ‚Äì see Section C and footnote 15 Gulf's termination of the Cities Service acquisition resulted in more than 15 years of shareholder litigation against Gulf (and later Chevron).NY Times report on litigation 1999 award to Occidental With declining margins in the industry and left without Citgo's reserves, Mesa and its investor partners kept hunting for a takeover target, only to discover while fighting Gulf for Citgo how increasingly top-heavy its portfolio and declining reserves were undervaluing its overall assets. They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil's stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC. In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company's stock, larger than the founding Mellon family's share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa's interest by calling a shareholders' meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation's by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would \\"slim down\\" Gulf's market share. Pickens had acquired the reputation of being a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.Famous Texans: outline history of Pickens and Mesa, see para 5 Gulf management and directors took the view that the Mesa bid represented an undervaluation of the Gulf business as a long-term going concern and that it was not in the interest of Gulf shareholders. James Lee, Gulf's CEO and chairman, even claimed during the November 1983 shareholders meeting to address the Mesa ownership that Pickens' royalty trust idea was nothing more than a \\"get-rich-quick scheme\\" that would undermine the corporation's profit potential in the coming decades. Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf's price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RKO) and finally Chevron to act as its white knight in late 1984. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760 million ($ million today) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron. Pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for Gulf shareholders (as well as its management that fought him at every turn), Mesa's shares were the last to be paid out by Chevron. The forced merger of Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate considering legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year‚Äîbefore the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government intervention in the matter and would veto any bill. However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned to testify before the Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions.The New York Times report: \\"FTC approves merger\\", October 1984 Never before had a \\"small operator\\" successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf's case a \\"Fortune 10\\" corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive \\"Seven Sisters\\" club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the \\"non-major independents\\". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that \\"mostly all we talk about in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens\\". Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 as well as some of the international operations. The effect on the Pittsburgh area was severe as close to 900 PhD and research jobs and 600 headquarters (accounting, law, clerical) jobs were transferred to California or cut, a payroll of $54 million ($ million today) and corporate charity to 50 Western Pennsylvania organizations worth $2 million/year ($ million/year today). These losses were mitigated some with the donation of Gulf Labs in suburban north Pittsburgh to the University of Pittsburgh to be used as a research business incubator along with $5 million ($ million today) in maintenance and seed money. The \\"Gulf Labs\\" research complex consisted of 55 multi-story buildings with on and including several chemical labs, petroleum production and refining areas and even a nuclear laboratory complete with reactor in 1985 and employed close to 2,000 engineers and scientists operating with a $100 million budget ($ million today) from Gulf/Chevron. After its donation, it was renamed the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center or U-PARC and opened to small technology, computer and engineering firms as well as graduate level research.  Aftermath  BP, Chevron, Cumberland Farms and other companies that acquired former Gulf operations continued to use the Gulf name through the early 1990s. This caused consumer confusion in the US retail market as the parent companies would not accept each other's credit cards. All former Gulf stations franchised by BP and Chevron in the United States have since been converted to those names. Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLP), based in Framingham, Massachusetts, has bought a license for North American rights to the Gulf brand from Chevron. Chevron still owned the Gulf brand, but was making almost no direct use of it. In January 2010, GOLP bought the entire brand from Chevron and began a nationwide expansion campaign. GOLP operates a distribution network reaching from Maine to Ohio. Most Gulf-branded filling stations in North America are owned by Cumberland Farms of Framingham, which owns a two-thirds interest in GOLP.GOLP website: details of GOLP operation In addition there are some independently owned franchises still operating under the Gulf brand within North America, such as the American Refining Group, which is licensed by Chevron to blend and distribute Gulf-branded lubricants.American Refining Group: lubes website Gulf Oil International (GOI)GOI: http://www.gulfoilltd.com/ owns the rights to the Gulf brand outside the United States, Spain & Portugal. It is now owned by the Hinduja Group.GOI website: history of GOI After they acquired a large share from the Taher family, a major Saudi Arabian family led by Dr. Abdulhadi H. Taher (former governor of the Saudi Petroleum and Mineral organization and board member of Aramco). GOI trades mainly in lubricants, oils, and greases. GOI is also involved in franchising the Gulf brand to operators in the petroleum and automotive sectors; Gulf-branded filling stations can be found in several countries including the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, the Slovak & Czech Republics, the Netherlands, Jordan, Finland and Turkey. GOI has direct and indirect interests in a number of businesses that use the Gulf brand under license. The Canadian exploration, production, and distribution arm of Gulf Oil was sold to Olympia and York in 1985. From 1992 it continued as an independent oil company (Gulf Canada Resources) until its acquisition by Conoco in 2002.CNN.com article: Conoco to buy Gulf Canada Most Gulf downstream operations in Europe were sold to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in early 1983. The associated Gulf filling stations were converted to trade under the Q8 brand by 1988.1983 NYT article: sale of Gulf operations to KPC However, attempts to sell Gulf Oil (Great Britain) to KPC failed because of irrevocable GOC guarantees given earlier in regard to bonds issued to finance the construction of refinery facilities in the UK. GO(GB) was taken over by Chevron and its stations continued to use the Gulf brand name and insignia until 1997 when the network was sold to Shell, although by this stage a fairly large proportion of Gulf stations were supplied by jobbers rather than Gulf Oil (GB). Gulf completely withdrew from the UK in 1997.Company News report, 1997: Gulf Oil (GB) sold to Shell This represented the end of the last major \\"downstream\\" use of the Gulf brand by Chevron.  Revival  GOI and GOLP continue to sell Gulf-branded lubricants worldwide through a network of official licensed companies, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiary companies. Many of these official Gulf distributors carry out local marketing and sponsorship which help to raise the profile of the brand. Of these wholly owned subsidiaries Gulf Oil Corporation India has raised the market profile of the Gulf brand in the Middle East. GOCL have emerged as one of leading lubricants brands in India and run many marketing sponsorships targeted at the ever-growing youth sector in the country. GOI licenses the Gulf brand and logo in the UK to the Bayford group, one of the largest independent fuel distributors. Starting in 2001, a new Gulf network of independent stations is slowly reappearing across the UK. At present, many of these stations are notable for offering genuine leaded four-star petrol, for which Bayford has a special dispensationBayford-Gulf: sale of leaded (4 star) petrol to sell. At the same time, Gulf Lubricants (UK) Ltd was set up to market Gulf products (mostly manufactured by the Gulf Netherlands operation) in the UK. This return by Gulf to the UK after a four-year absence used the slogan \\"The Return of the Legend\\".Bayford Gulf website: Gulf filling stations in the UK The post-2001 Gulf presence in the UK is a wholly network-based operation. It involves almost no direct Gulf investment in fixed assets, corporate infrastructure, or manufacturing capability. This is a complete contrast to the pre-1997 presence. In January 2010, after using the name since 1986, GOLP acquired all right, title and interest in the Gulf brand name in the United States and announced plans to expand the use of the Gulf brand beyond its parent company's Northeastern United States base. Its promotions have included sponsorship of major sporting events in the area with advertisements for Gulf in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. To take one case as an illustrative example of the Gulf revival, after Texaco's 2001 merger with Chevron, many former Texaco stations in Pittsburgh switched to Gulf since Chevron does not service the Greater Pittsburgh area. As a result, the Texaco brand name disappeared from the area in June 2004 when the nonexclusive rights agreement with Shell expired, with Shell itself expanding in the area by means other than Texaco but, in June 2006 Chevron gave exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. and sold some BP gas stations in the southeast which were Gulf gas stations. In New England, former Exxon stations have been rebranded as Gulf, in accordance with the consent decree that allowed the merger of Exxon and Mobil. Many of the former Exxon stations feature a rectangular logo that fit into the existing sign standards used by Exxon. Gulf refers to the look as its \\"sunrise\\" imaging. Aston Martin V8 Vantage in Gulf Oil livery, as seen in 2012 The Gulf logo is still used around the world by various businesses. GOI uses it for their marketing activities to focus on the sponsorship of motor sport teams including MotoGP team Aprilia Racing Team Gresini for the 2019 season and Formula 1 team McLaren for the 2020 season. This sponsorship is used across the world by Gulf distributors, alongside local activity demonstrating the GOI company ethos of \\"your local global brand\\". In 2009, the clothing store chain Old Navy began selling T-shirts bearing the old Gulf logo, along with the former logos of Standard Oil and Chevron. Between 1980 and 2000, Gulf moved from being a monolithic, vertically integrated multinational corporation to being more of a network of allied business interests. This has given the entire Gulf enterprise a high degree of strategic and operational flexibility. It is a move that reflects fundamental changes in the economics of international business. > Alliances represent yet another shift in the organization of economic > transactions from organizational hierarchies to networks; from mass to > flexible production; from large, vertically integrated organizations to > disintegration and horizontal networks of economic units; from \\"Fordist\\" to > \\"post-Fordist\\" companies.Stephen J Kobrin, Globalisation and multinationals > (Pitman), 1997 In March 2016 Gulf MX announced that will put their own filling stations in Mexico, which is planned to begin operations on July of the same year to compete with the local company (PEMEX) (as a result of the recent changes in the local laws in matter of energy and oil resources). As said by Sergio De La Vega (CEO of Gulf Mexico) in order to improve a better service Gulf will make fidelity programs and dedicated smartphone apps. for customers (improving fuel payment into the same, fuel administration and better experience with fidelity programs as another additional benefits) adding to modern service stations with more quality-added services. Adding to that, Gulf will offer franchises to the existing filling station owners to convert them to Gulf branding.  Case studies in current use of the Gulf brand   Independent filling stations in the UK  Gulf service station in Tollesbury, England, 2009 In 1970, there were nearly 25,000 filling stations in the UK, of which 10,000 were independents (typically, privately owned and supplied by a major or jobber while using a brand under license). By the end of 1999, the number of filling stations had dropped to 13,700 and to 9,700 at the end of 2005.Guardian report on Energy Institute annual market survey In recent years, filling stations have been closing at a rate of 50 per month. Many of the smaller and independent stations have succumbed to competition from out-of- town supermarkets that undercut local enterprises through sheer volume of sales and shared overheads.Energy Institute: press release on 2004 marketing survey  Pennsylvania Turnpike  Gulf Service Station and Howard Johnson Restaurant, Pennsylvania Turnpike For decades, Gulf operated filling stations on the Pennsylvania Turnpike toll highway system alongside the Howard Johnson's restaurants at the Turnpike's travel plazas (which correspond to European motorway service areas). This began in 1950 with the opening of the Philadelphia Extension, and Gulf added more filling stations as the system was extended. The Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania (now part of Exxon) had exclusive rights to provide filling station services on the sections of the system that opened prior to 1950, principally the Irwin-to-Carlisle section. In the 1980s, Sunoco was awarded the franchise to operate the filling stations at the Sideling Hill and now-closed Hempfield travel plazas. This led to a bidding war among three of Pennsylvania's most recognizable gasoline brands each time a travel plaza franchise came up for renewal. Gulf had the opportunity to become the exclusive provider of filling stations at travel plazas along the Pennsylvania Turnpike after Exxon withdrew from the Turnpike in 1990. Cumberland Farms (owner of the Gulf brand in the northeastern U.S.) was awarded a new contract with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, but the contract was sold to Sunoco two years later as part of the company's bankruptcy proceedings. In June 1992, all of the former Gulf filling stations on the Turnpike (as with the Exxon ones before it) converted to Sunoco. All of the travel plazas continue to sell Sunoco fuel today.  Gulf products  Vintage Gulf Oil sign photographed in Roslyn, New York, 2018 Most filling stations in Europe sell three types of fuel: unleaded, LRP, and diesel. Although these products lack any real brand differentiation, this has not always been the case. Until well into the 1970s, Gulf (in common with other oil companies) sold distinctive brands of petrol/gasoline including subregular Gulftane (briefly a midgrade low lead), Good Gulf regular, Gulf No-Nox premium, Gulf Super Unleaded, and Gulfcrest (Regular Unleaded). Gulfcrest was also a super premium grade in the 1950s and early 1960s. Gulf petrol was sold using the slogans \\"Good Gulf Gasoline,\\" and \\"Gulf ‚Äì the Gas with Guts.\\" Gulf service stations often supplied customers with pens and key rings bearing these slogans. For a few years, beginning in 1966, Gulf stations in the U.S. gave away orange plastic \\"Extra Kick Horseshoes\\" to customers who filled their tanks with Gulf's No-Nox premium gasoline (the novelty items were commonly mounted on bumpers). GOI still produces and sells a wide range of branded oil based products including lubricants and greases of all kinds.GOI product and services product list These include products for a variety of applications ranging from metal working oils to refrigeration oils. Car engine oils include the Gulf Formula, Gulf MAX, and Gulf TEC ranges. Heavy duty diesel engine lubricants include the Gulf Supreme and Gulf Superfleet ranges. In the Summer of 2013, Gulf Oil licensed the \\"Gulf\\" name for racing fuels in a return to the American racing scene for the 2014 competition season. The fuels were announced at the Performance Racing Industry Show in Indianapolis, Indiana in December 2013. The racing fuels support the World Racing League and the Formula Atlantic Championship in the United States. CEOs * S.A.

The Sicarii carried sicae, or small daggers, concealed in their cloaks.Paul Christian Who were the Sicarii?, Meridian Magazine, June 7, 2004 At public gatherings, they pulled out these daggers to attack Romans and Roman sympathizers alike, blending into the crowd after the deed to escape detection. The Sicarii are regarded as one of the earliest known organized assassination units of cloak and daggers, predating the Islamic Hashishin and Japanese ninja by centuries.Pichtel, John, Terrorism and WMDs: Awareness and Response, CRC Press (April 25, 2011) p.3-4. Ross, Jeffrey Ian, Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present, Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. The derived Spanish term sicario is used in contemporary Latin America to describe a hitman working for a drug cartel. Etymology In Latin, Sicarii is the plural form of Sicarius \\"dagger-man\\", \\"dagger-wielder\\". Sica, possibly from Proto-Albanian *tsikƒÅ (whence Albanian thika, \\"knife\\"), from Proto-Indo- European *·∏±ey- (\\"to sharpen\\") possibly via Illyrian. In later Latin usage, \\"sicarius\\" was also the standard term for a murderer (see, e.g., the Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficiis), and to this day \\"sicario\\" is a salaried assassin in Spanish and a commissioned murderer in Italian and in Portuguese. History Victims of the Sicarii are thought to have included Jonathan the High Priest, although it is possible that his murder was orchestrated by the Roman governor Antonius Felix. Some murders were met with severe retaliation by the Romans on the entire Hebrew population of the country. However, on some occasions, the Sicarii would release their intended victim if their terms were met. Much of what is known about the Sicarii comes from the Romano-Jewish by Josephus, who wrote that the Sicarii agreed to release the kidnapped secretary of Eleazar, governor of the Temple precincts, in exchange for the release of ten captured assassins. At the beginning of the First Roman-Jewish War, the Sicarii, and (possibly) Zealot helpers (Josephus differentiated between the two but did not explain the main differences in depth), gained access to Jerusalem and committed a series of atrocities in an attempt to incite the population into war against Rome. In one account, given in the Talmud, they destroyed the city's food supply, using starvation to force the people to fight against the Roman siege, instead of negotiating peace. Their leaders, including Menahem ben Yehuda and Eleazar ben Ya'ir, were notable figures in the war, and the group fought in many battles against the Romans as soldiers. Together with a small group of followers, Menahem made his way to the fortress of Masada, took over a Roman garrison and slaughtered all 700 soldiers there. They also took over another fortress called Antonia and overpowered the troops of Agrippa II. He also trained them to conduct various guerrilla operations on Roman convoys and legions stationed around Judea. Josephus also wrote that the Sicarii raided nearby Hebrew villages including Ein Gedi, where they massacred 700 women and children.Ancient battle divides Israel as Masada 'myth' unravels; Was the siege really so heroic, asks Patrick Cockburn in Jerusalem, The Independent, 30 March 1997 The Zealots, Sicarii and other prominent rebels finally joined forces to attack and temporarily take Jerusalem from Rome in 66 AD,Levick, Barbara (1999). Vespasian. London: Routledge, pp. 116‚Äì119. where they took control of the Temple in Jerusalem, executing anyone who tried to oppose their power. The local populace resisted their control and launched a series of sieges and raids to remove the rebel factions. The rebels eventually silenced the uprising and Jerusalem stayed in their hands for the duration of the war. The Romans finally came to take back the city, and they led counter- attacks and sieges to starve the rebels inside. The rebels held for some time, but the constant bickering and the lack of leadership led the groups to disintegrate. The leader of the Sicarii, Menahem, was killed by rival factions during an altercation. Soon, the Romans regained control, and finally destroyed the whole city in 70 AD. Eleazar and his followers returned to Masada and continued their rebellion against the Romans until 73 AD. The Romans eventually took the fortress and, according to Josephus, found that most of its defenders had committed suicide rather than surrender. In Josephus' The Jewish War (vii), after the fall of the Temple in 70 AD, the sicarii became the dominant revolutionary Hebrew faction, scattered abroad. Josephus particularly associates them with the mass suicide at Masada in 73 AD and to the subsequent refusal \\"to submit to the taxation census when Cyrenius was sent to Judea to make one\\" (Josephus) as part of their rebellion's religious and political scheme. Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, was believed by some to be a sicarius.Bastiaan van Iersel, Mark: A Reader-Response Commentary, Continuum International (1998), p. 167. This opinion is objected to by modern historians, mainly because Josephus in The War of the Hebrews (2:254‚Äì7) mentions the appearance of the Sicarii as a new phenomenon during the procuratorships of Felix (52‚Äì60 AD), having no apparent relation with the group called Sicarii by Romans at times of Quirinius. The 2nd century compendium of Jewish oral law, the Mishnah (Makhshirin 1:6), mentions the word sikrin (), perhaps related to Sicarii, and which is explained by the early rabbinic commentators as being related to the (= robbers), and to government personnel involved with implementing the laws of Sicaricon.Rabbi Hai Gaon's Commentary on Seder Taharot, cited in Babylonian Talmud (Niddah Tractate), s.v.

A base defines (one says also generates) a topology on that has, as open sets, all unions of elements of .By a standard convention, the empty set (which is open) is the union of the empty collection. Bases have been introduced because some topologies have a base consisting of open sets that have specific useful properties. This is typically the case for the Zariski topology on the spectrum of a ring. For the usual basis of this topology, every finite intersection of basis elements is a basis element. Therefore bases are sometimes required to be stable by finite intersection.  Definition and basic properties A base is a collection B of subsets of X satisfying the following properties: # The base elements cover X. # Let B1, B2 be base elements and let I be their intersection. Then for each x in I, there is a base element B3 containing x such that B3 is subset of I. An equivalent property is: any finite intersectionWe are using a convention that the empty intersection of subsets of X is considered finite and is equal to X. of elements of B can be written as a union of elements of B. These two conditions are exactly what is needed to ensure that the set of all unions of subsets of B is a topology on X. If a collection B of subsets of X fails to satisfy these properties, then it is not a base for any topology on X. (It is a subbase, however, as is any collection of subsets of X.) Conversely, if B satisfies these properties, then there is a unique topology on X for which B is a base; it is called the topology generated by B. (This topology is the intersection of all topologies on X containing B.) This is a very common way of defining topologies. A sufficient but not necessary condition for B to generate a topology on X is that B is closed under intersections; then we can always take B3 = I above. For example, the collection of all open intervals in the real line forms a base for a topology on the real line because the intersection of any two open intervals is itself an open interval or empty. In fact they are a base for the standard topology on the real numbers. However, a base is not unique. Many different bases, even of different sizes, may generate the same topology. For example, the open intervals with rational endpoints are also a base for the standard real topology, as are the open intervals with irrational endpoints, but these two sets are completely disjoint and both properly contained in the base of all open intervals. In contrast to a basis of a vector space in linear algebra, a base need not be maximal; indeed, the only maximal base is the topology itself. In fact, any open set generated by a base may be safely added to the base without changing the topology. The smallest possible cardinality of a base is called the weight of the topological space. An example of a collection of open sets which is not a base is the set S of all semi-infinite intervals of the forms (‚àí‚àû, a) and (a, ‚àû), where a is a real number. Then S is not a base for any topology on R. To show this, suppose it were. Then, for example, (‚àí‚àû, 1) and (0, ‚àû) would be in the topology generated by S, being unions of a single base element, and so their intersection (0,1) would be as well. But (0, 1) clearly cannot be written as a union of elements of S. Using the alternate definition, the second property fails, since no base element can \\"fit\\" inside this intersection. Given a base for a topology, in order to prove convergence of a net or sequence it is sufficient to prove that it is eventually in every set in the base which contains the putative limit.  Objects defined in terms of bases  * The order topology is usually defined as the topology generated by a collection of open-interval-like sets. * The metric topology is usually defined as the topology generated by a collection of open balls. * A second-countable space is one that has a countable base. * The discrete topology has the singletons as a base. * The profinite topology on a group is defined by taking the collection of all normal subgroups of finite index as a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity. * The Zariski topology of \\\\mathbb C^n is the topology that has the algebraic sets as closed sets. It has a basis formed by the set complements of algebraic hypersurfaces. * The Zariski topology of the spectrum of a ring (the set of the prime ideals) has a basis such that each element consists of all prime ideals that do not contain a given element of the ring.  Theorems  * For each point x in an open set U, there is a base element containing x and contained in U. * A topology T2 is finer than a topology T1 if and only if for each x and each base element B of T1 containing x, there is a base element of T2 containing x and contained in B. * If B1,B2,...,Bn are bases for the topologies T1,T2,...,Tn, then the set product B1 √ó B2 √ó ... √ó Bn is a base for the product topology T1 √ó T2 √ó ... √ó Tn. In the case of an infinite product, this still applies, except that all but finitely many of the base elements must be the entire space. * Let B be a base for X and let Y be a subspace of X. Then if we intersect each element of B with Y, the resulting collection of sets is a base for the subspace Y. * If a function f : X ‚Üí Y maps every base element of X into an open set of Y, it is an open map. Similarly, if every preimage of a base element of Y is open in X, then f is continuous. * A collection of subsets of X is a topology on X if and only if it generates itself. * B is a basis for a topological space X if and only if the subcollection of elements of B which contain x form a local base at x, for any point x of X. Base for the closed sets Closed sets are equally adept at describing the topology of a space. There is, therefore, a dual notion of a base for the closed sets of a topological space. Given a topological space X, a family of closed sets F forms a base for the closed sets if and only if for each closed set A and each point x not in A there exists an element of F containing A but not containing x. It is easy to check that F is a base for the closed sets of X if and only if the family of complements of members of F is a base for the open sets of X. Let F be a base for the closed sets of X. Then #‚à©F = ‚àÖ #For each F1 and F2 in F the union F1 ‚à™ F2 is the intersection of some subfamily of F (i.e. for any x not in F1 or F2 there is an F3 in F containing F1 ‚à™ F2 and not containing x). Any collection of subsets of a set X satisfying these properties forms a base for the closed sets of a topology on X. The closed sets of this topology are precisely the intersections of members of F. In some cases it is more convenient to use a base for the closed sets rather than the open ones. For example, a space is completely regular if and only if the zero sets form a base for the closed sets. Given any topological space X, the zero sets form the base for the closed sets of some topology on X. This topology will be the finest completely regular topology on X coarser than the original one. In a similar vein, the Zariski topology on An is defined by taking the zero sets of polynomial functions as a base for the closed sets.  Weight and character  We shall work with notions established in . Fix X a topological space. Here, a network is a family \\\\mathcal{N} of sets, for which, for all points x and open neighbourhoods U containing x, there exists B in \\\\mathcal{N} for which x ‚àà B ‚äÜ U. Note that, unlike a basis, the sets in a network need not be open. We define the weight, w(X), as the minimum cardinality of a basis; we define the network weight, nw(X), as the minimum cardinality of a network; the character of a point, \\\\chi(x,X), as the minimum cardinality of a neighbourhood basis for x in X; and the character of X to be :\\\\chi(X)\\\\triangleq\\\\sup\\\\\\\\{\\\\chi(x,X):x\\\\in X\\\\\\\\}. The point of computing the character and weight is to be able to tell what sort of bases and local bases can exist. We have the following facts: * nw(X) ‚â§ w(X). * if X is discrete, then w(X) = nw(X) = X. * if X is Hausdorff, then nw(X) is finite iff X is finite discrete. * if B is a basis of X then there is a basis B'\\\\subseteq B of size B'\\\\leq w(X). * if N a neighbourhood basis for x in X then there is a neighbourhood basis N'\\\\subseteq N of size N'\\\\leq \\\\chi(x,X). * if f : X ‚Üí Y is a continuous surjection, then nw(Y) ‚â§ w(X). (Simply consider the Y-network f'B \\\\triangleq \\\\\\\\{fU : U\\\\in B\\\\\\\\} for each basis B of X.) * if (X,\\\\tau) is Hausdorff, then there exists a weaker Hausdorff topology (X,\\\\tau') so that w(X,\\\\tau')\\\\leq nw(X,\\\\tau). So a fortiori, if X is also compact, then such topologies coincide and hence we have, combined with the first fact, nw(X) = w(X). * if f : X ‚Üí Y a continuous surjective map from a compact metrisable space to an Hausdorff space, then Y is compact metrisable. The last fact follows from f(X) being compact Hausdorff, and hence nw(f(X))=w(f(X))\\\\leq w(X)\\\\leq\\\\aleph_0 (since compact metrisable spaces are necessarily second countable); as well as the fact that compact Hausdorff spaces are metrisable exactly in case they are second countable. (An application of this, for instance, is that every path in an Hausdorff space is compact metrisable.)  Increasing chains of open sets  Using the above notation, suppose that w(X) ‚â§ Œ∫ some infinite cardinal. Then there does not exist a strictly increasing sequence of open sets (equivalently strictly decreasing sequence of closed sets) of length ‚â• Œ∫+. To see this (without the axiom of choice), fix : \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ U_{\\\\xi} \\\\right \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\xi\\\\in\\\\kappa}, as a basis of open sets. And suppose per contra, that : \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ V_{\\\\xi}\\\\right \\\\\\\\}_{\\\\xi\\\\in\\\\kappa^{+}} were a strictly increasing sequence of open sets. This means :\\\\forall \\\\alpha<\\\\kappa^+: \\\\qquad V_{\\\\alpha}\\\\setminus\\\\bigcup_{\\\\xi<\\\\alpha} V_{\\\\xi} eq \\\\varnothing. For :x\\\\in V_{\\\\alpha}\\\\setminus\\\\bigcup_{\\\\xi<\\\\alpha}V_{\\\\xi}, we may use the basis to find some UŒ≥ with x in UŒ≥ ‚äÜ VŒ±. In this way we may well- define a map, f : Œ∫+ ‚Üí Œ∫ mapping each Œ± to the least Œ≥ for which UŒ≥ ‚äÜ VŒ± and meets :V_{\\\\alpha} \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{\\\\xi<\\\\alpha} V_{\\\\xi}. This map is injective, otherwise there would be Œ± < Œ≤ with f(Œ±) = f(Œ≤) = Œ≥, which would further imply UŒ≥ ‚äÜ VŒ± but also meets :V_{\\\\beta} \\\\setminus \\\\bigcup_{\\\\xi<\\\\alpha} V_{\\\\xi} \\\\subseteq V_{\\\\beta} \\\\setminus V_{\\\\alpha}, which is a contradiction. But this would go to show that Œ∫+ ‚â§ Œ∫, a contradiction.

It uses a variety of audio codecs, ranging from low- bitrate formats that can be used over dialup modems, to high-fidelity formats for music. It can also be used as a streaming audio format, that is played at the same time as it is downloaded. In the past, many internet radio stations used RealAudio to stream their programming over the internet in real time. In recent years, however, the format has become less common and has given way to more popular audio formats. RealAudio was heavily used by the BBC websites until 2009, though it was discontinued due to its declining use. BBC World Service, the last of the BBC websites to use RealAudio, discontinued its use in March 2011. File extensions RealAudio files were originally identified by a filename extension of .ra (for Real Audio). In 1997, RealNetworks also began offering a video format called RealVideo. The combination of the audio and video formats was called RealMedia and used the file extension .rm. However, the latest version of RealProducer, Real's flagship encoder, reverted to using .ra for audio-only files, and began using .rv for video files (with or without audio), and .rmvb for VBR video files. The .ram (Real Audio Metadata) and .smil (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) file formats are sometimes encountered as links from web pages (see Streaming Audio section below). Players The official player for RealMedia content is RealNetworks' RealPlayer SP, currently at version 16, and is available for various platforms in binary form. Several features of this program have proven controversial (most recently, RP11's ability to record unprotected streaming media from web sites), and many alternative players have been developed. RealNetworks initially tried to discourage development of alternative players by keeping their audio format secret. However, in recent years, RealNetworks has made efforts to be somewhat more open, and has founded the Helix Community, a collaborative open source project, to extend their media framework. When RealAudio was introduced, RealNetworks disclosed no technical details about the audio format or how it was encoded, but it was soon noticed that some of the audio codecs used in RealAudio were identical to those used in cellular telephones and digital television. As these formats had been described in detail in various technical papers and standards documents, it was possible to write software capable of playing RealAudio based on this information. A variety of unofficial players now exist, including MPlayer, and Real Alternative. However, Real Alternative does not decode the audio data by itself, but relies on the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) from the official RealPlayer. Thus Real Alternative requires RealPlayer to be installed (or at least its DLLs) in order to function. Most other players are based on FFmpeg, which has its own audio codec library. The audio codecs in ffmpeg were written based on the publicly available information about the formats, and do not use the RealPlayer or Helix software. It is also possible to obtain codecs which allow Windows Media Player to play some versions of RealAudio. Although RealNetworks has made the Helix player available as an open source project, they have kept some of the audio codecs proprietary, and the Helix player can not play all RealAudio files. Streaming audio RealAudio was developed as a streaming media format, meaning that it can be played while it is downloaded. It is possible to stream RealAudio using HTTP. In this case, the RealAudio file is retrieved similarly to a normal web page, but playback begins as soon as the first part is received and continues while the rest of the file is downloaded. Using HTTP streaming works best with pre-recorded files so some alternative protocols have been developed which work better for live broadcasts. The first version of RealAudio used a proprietary protocol called PNA or PNM to send streaming audio data. RealNetworks later switched to the IETF standardized Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) but they use RTSP only to manage the connection. The actual audio data is sent with their own proprietary RDT protocol, which they initially kept secret. Recently, some specifications for the RDT protocol have been made public through the Helix Community project. By around 2004 the open-source MPlayer project developed a means of playing the RDT streams.MPlayer In many cases, web pages do not link directly to a RealAudio file. Instead, they link to a .ram (Real Audio Metadata) or SMIL file. This is a small text file containing a link to the audio stream. When a user clicks on such a link, the user's web browser downloads the .ram or .smil file and launches the user's media player. The media player reads the PNM or RTSP URL from the file and then plays the stream. With RealPlayer SP, it is now possible to save an audio stream to a file. Other programs, including MPlayer, RM Downloader, VLC media player, StreamBox VCR, HiDownload and Real7ime Converter can also save streams to a file. Codecs RealAudio files are compressed using several audio codecs. Each codec is identified by a four character code. Below is a list of the codecs and the version in which each was introduced: * , : IS-54 VSELP (RealAudio 1) * : G.728 LD-CELP (RealAudio 2) * : Dolby AC3 (RealAudio 3) * : Sipro Lab Telecom ACELP-NET (RealAudio 4/5) * : G2/Cook Codec (RealAudio 6) * : Sony ATRAC3 (RealAudio 8) * : MPEG-4 LC-AAC (RealAudio 9) * : MPEG-4 HE-AAC (RealAudio 10) * : RealAudio Lossless Format (RealAudio 10) While the newest version of RealPlayer should be able to play any RealAudio file, other programs may not support all codecs.

(\\"The Texas Company\\") is an American oil subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. Its flagship product is its fuel \\"Texaco with Techron\\". It also owns the Havoline motor oil brand. Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron Corporation in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to the Shell Oil Company. It began as the Texas Fuel Company, founded in 1902 in Beaumont, Texas, by Joseph S. Cullinan, Thomas J. Donoghue, Walter Benona Sharp, and Arnold Schlaet upon the discovery of oil at Spindletop. The Texas Fuel Company was not set up to drill wells or to produce crude oil. To accomplish this, Cullinan organized the Producers Oil Company in 1902, as a group of investors affiliated with The Texas Fuel Company. Men like John W. (\\"Bet A Million\\") Gates invested in \\"certificates of interest\\" to an amount of almost ninety thousand dollars. Future restructuring would merge Producers Oil Company and The Texas Fuel Company as Texaco when the company needed additional funding which J.W. Gates provided in the amount of around $590,000.00 in return for company stock. For many years, Texaco was the only company selling gasoline under the same brand name in all 50 US states, as well as Canada, making it the most truly national brand among its competitors. It was also one of the Seven Sisters which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Its current logo features a white star in a red circle (a reference to the lone star of Texas), leading to the long-running advertising jingles \\"You can trust your car to the man who wears the star\\" and \\"Star of the American Road.\\" The company was headquartered in Harrison, New York, near White Plains, prior to the merger with Chevron. Texaco gasoline comes with Techron, an additive developed by Chevron, as of 2005, replacing the previous CleanSystem3. The Texaco brand is strong in the U.S., Latin America and West Africa. It has a presence in Europe as well; for example, it is a well-known retail brand in the UK, with around 850 Texaco-branded service stations. History 1901‚Äì38: Beginnings Galveston station, c. 1910-20 Texaco was founded in Beaumont, Texas as the Texas Fuel Company in 1901, by Jim Hogg, Joseph S. Cullinan, John Warne Gates, and Arnold Schlaet. On 1 May 1902, the Texas Company was formed from the assets of Texas Fuel assets, and additional capitalization. In 1905, it established an operation in Antwerp, Belgium, under the name Continental Petroleum Company, which it acquired control of in 1913.News of the Week: Union Oil of Delaware, Business Digest and Investment Weekly, Volume 26, Issue 5, Arthur Fremont Rider (editor), 1920, p. 95 (retrieved August 2, 2010 from Google Books) The next year, Texaco moved to new offices in Houston on the corner of San Jacinto and Rusk. In 1928, Texaco became the first U.S. oil company to sell its gasoline nationwide under one single brand name in all 48 states. In 1931, Texaco purchased Indian Oil Company, based in Illinois. This expanded Texaco's refining and marketing base in the Midwest and also gave Texaco the rights to Indian's Havoline motor oil, which became a Texaco product. The next year, Texaco introduced Fire Chief gasoline nationwide, a so-called \\"super-octane\\" motor fuel touted as meeting or exceeding government standards for gasoline for fire engines and other emergency vehicles.\\"Depend on the Gasoline Fire Engines Depend On! Texaco Fire Chief Super-Octane Gasoline,\\" Albany Democrat-Herald, May 27, 1932, pg. 4. (Ad.) It was promoted through a radio program over NBC hosted by Ed Wynn, called the Texaco Fire Chief. In 1936, the Texas Corporation purchased the Barco oil concession in Colombia, and formed a joint venture with Socony- Vacuum, now Mobil, to develop it. Over the next three years the company engaged in a highly challenging project to drill wells and build a pipeline to the coast across mountains and then through uncharted swamps and jungles. During this time, Texaco also illegally supplied the fascist Gen. Franco faction in Spanish Civil War, despite a federal fine, with a total of oil. Also in 1936, marketing operations east of Suez (including Asia, East Africa, and Australasia) were placed into a joint venture with Standard Oil Company of California ‚Äì Socal (Chevron) under the brand name Caltex, in exchange for Socal placing its Bahrain refinery and Arabian oilfields into the venture. The next year, Texaco commissioned industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague to develop a modern service station design. 1939 Texaco tanker truck by Dodge on display at the Henry Ford Museum In 1938, Texaco introduced Sky Chief gasoline, a premium fuel developed from the ground up as a high-octane gasoline rather than just an ethylized regular product. In 1939, Texaco became one of the first oil companies to introduce a \\"Registered Rest Room\\" program to ensure that restroom facilities at all Texaco stations nationwide maintained a standard level of cleanliness to the motoring public. After the onset of World War II in 1939, Texaco's CEO, Torkild Rieber, an admirer of Hitler, hired pro-Nazi assistants who cabled Berlin \\"coded information about ships leaving New York for Britain and what their cargoes were.\\" This espionage easily enabled Hitler to destroy the ships.\\"‚ÄòSpain in Our Hearts,‚Äô by Adam Hochschild,\\" Book Review by Michael Kazin, New York Times, March 29, 2016. In 1940, Rieber was forced to resign when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the Herald Tribune through information produced by British Security Coordination.The Secret History of British Intelligence in the Americas, 1940-1945 pp56-57 Life Magazine portrayed Rieber's resignation as unfair, advocating that he only dined with Westrick, and lent him a company car. Historic gasoline pumps in the Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, Dwight, Illinois During the war, Texaco ranked 93rd among United States corporations in the value of military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619 In 1947, Caltex expanded to include Texaco's European marketing operations. That same year, Texaco merged its British operation with Trinidad Leaseholds under the name Regent; it gained full control of Regent in 1956,Report by the Monopolies Commission on the Supply of Petrol to Retailers in the United Kingdom, 1965 but the Regent brand remained in use until 1968-9. In 1954, the company added the detergent additive Petrox to its \\"Sky Chief\\" gasoline, which was also souped up with higher octane to meet the antiknock needs of new cars with high-compression engines. The next year, Texaco became the sole sponsor of The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC-TV. In 1959, the Texas Company changed its corporate name to Texaco, Inc. to better reflect the value of the Texaco brand name, which represented the biggest selling gasoline brand in the U.S. and only marketer selling gasoline under one brand name in all 50 states. It also acquired McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Ltd. of Canada and changes its name to Texaco Canada Limited. Around this time, Paragon Oil, a major fuel oil distribution company in the northeastern U.S, was acquired. 1964‚Äì98: Various ventures  Texaco gas pumps in Milford, Illinois, photographed in 1977 In 1964, Texaco introduced the \\"Matawan\\" service station design at a station in Matawan, New Jersey.Texaco: Service Stations, accessed November 23, 2006 Two years later, Texaco replaced the long-running banjo sign with a new hexagon logo that had previously been test-marketed with the \\"Matawan\\" station design introduced two years earlier. The new logo featured a red outline with TEXACO in black bold lettering and a small banjo logo with a red star and green T at bottom. The following year, the Regent name was replaced by Texaco at British petrol stations. In 1970, in response to increasingly stringent federal emission standards that would ultimately lead to the mandating of unleaded gasoline in 1975, and later-model cars and trucks, Texaco introduced lead-free Texaco as the first regular-octane lead-free gasoline at stations in the Los Angeles area and throughout Southern California. Lead-free Texaco became available nationwide in 1974. On November 20, 1980, the Lake Peigneur/Jefferson Island disaster occurred. Two years later, a new service station design was introduced. Several product names were also changed with the advent of self- service including Lead-free Texaco to Texaco Unleaded, Fire Chief to Texaco Regular, and Super Lead-free Sky Chief to Texaco Super Unleaded. In 1982, Texaco Canada Limited merged with Texaco Explorations Canada Limited to form Texaco Canada Incorporated, with head offices in Toronto. Texaco fuel station in Po√° (S√£o Paulo), Brazil, 2009 On November 19, 1985, Pennzoil won a US$10.53 billion verdict against Texaco in the largest civil verdict in US history. This was due to the fact that Texaco established a signed contract to buy Getty Oil after Pennzoil entered into an unsigned, yet still binding, buyout contract with Gordon Getty. In 1987, Texaco filed for bankruptcy. It was the largest in U.S. history until 2001. In January 1989, Texaco and Saudi Aramco agreed to form a joint venture known as Star Enterprise in which Saudi Aramco would own a 50% share of Texaco's refining and marketing operations in the eastern U.S. and Gulf Coast. In 1989, Texaco introduced System3 gasolines in all three grades of fuel, featuring the latest detergent additive technology to improve performance by reducing deposits that clog fuel injection systems. Toronto-based Texaco Canada Incorporated was sold to Imperial Oil with all Texaco Canada retail operations converted to Esso brand. Two years later, the company was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1991, non retail Canadian operations became Texaco Canada Petroleum Incorporated with head office in Calgary, Alberta. In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, as a result of massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco's Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents. In 1994, Texaco's System3 gasolines were replaced by new CleanSystem3 gasoline for improved engine performance. In 1995, Texaco merged its Danish and Norwegian downstream operations with those of Norsk Hydro under the new brand HydroTexaco. This joint venture was sold in 2007, to Norwegian retail interests as YX Energi, following the purchase of Hydro by Statoil. Texaco Canada Petroleum was merged into the parent in 1995. In 1996, Texaco paid over $170 million to settle racial discrimination lawsuits filed by black employees at the company. It was the largest racial discrimination lawsuit settlement in the U.S. at the time, and was particularly damaging to Texaco's public relations when tapes were released containing ethnic slurs used repeatedly by company officers at high-level corporate meetings. 1999‚Äìpresent: Chevron Corporation A Texaco station in Lewisville, Texas, 2017 In 1999, the company formed the joint venture Equilon with Shell Oil Company, combining their Western and Midwestern U.S. refining and marketing.Aspects of the Refining/Marketing Joint Ventures of Shell Oil, Star Enterprises, and Texaco , Retrieved on June 10, 2009. This gave rise to the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court antitrust case of Texaco Inc. v. Dagher, which cleared both Texaco and Shell of any antitrust liability concerning the pricing of Equilon's gasoline. That same year, another joint venture, Motiva Enterprises, was formed with Shell Oil Company and Saudi Aramco in which the Star Enterprise operations were merged with the Eastern and Gulf Coast U.S. refining and marketing operations of Shell. Texaco station in Bebington, UK, 2018 On February 8, 2002, Chevron Corporation merged with Texaco and Shell purchased Texaco's interest in the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures. Shell began converting its Texaco stations to the Shell brand the next year. Around 2003, due to lack of demand, Texaco closed Refineria Panam√°, a refinery in Col√≥n, Panama. In July 2004, Chevron regained non-exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. The following year, in August, Texaco introduced the Techron additive into its fuels in the U.S. and parts of Latin America. In 2007, Delek Benelux took over marketing activities for Chevron in Benelux, including 869 filling stations, mostly under the Texaco brand. Chevron Corporation also sold its Conoco stations in Mississippi to the Texaco brand name. \\"Texaco Canada Petroleum Incorporated\\" was dissolved in 2008, with Texaco exiting from the Canadian market. In 2010, Texaco ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic US, removing its brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C. Corporate headquarters Prior to the merger, Texaco's headquarters, a building, were in Harrison, New York, near White Plains.Brenner, Elsa. \\"IN BUSINESS; Morgan Stanley Seals Deal on Texaco Headquarters.\\" The New York Times.

In 2002, Chevron sold the former Texaco headquarters to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley bought the building and the surrounding for $42 million. Texaco leased 14 floors of the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City in the 1930s. As part of the leasing agreement with Texaco the building opened the Cloud Club, a lunch club for executives. Texaco moved to Westchester County, New York, in 1977. This contributed to the closure of the Cloud Club in 1979.McGrath, Charles. \\"A Lunch Club for the Higher-Ups\\". The New York Times. May 26, 2005. Retrieved on September 19, 2014. In popular culture A location was used in the opening scene of Cheech & Chong's Next Movie at 6407 West Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California, where the main characters Cheech and Chong siphon gasoline from a tow truck. A Jack in the Box now stands at that location. In Back to the Future and Back to the Future Part II, a Texaco station in the center of Hill Valley is shown in 1955, 1985, and 2015. In Stephen King's science fiction short story \\"The Jaunt\\", Texaco exists in the future and has shifted from selling oil to water. In the M*A*S*H episode \\"Last Laugh\\", Hawkeye references the slogan \\"Always trust your car to the man who wears a star,\\" which wasn't created until 9 years later. In the 1930s, comedian Ed Wynn hosted a half hour stand-up comedy/variety show on the NBC Radio Network, billed as \\"The Texaco Fire Chief\\", a reference to its regular grade gasoline. This trend continued into the late 1940s, when Wynn was replaced by Milton Berle as television becoming the dominant medium. The title was changed to the 60-minute Texaco Star Theater, which was also broadcast on NBC. Texaco was also the sponsor of the weekly Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, which air to this day since its inception in 1931. Sponsorships Racing driver Nigel Mansell driving in the 1993 CART IndyCar World Series Kenny Irwin Jr. driving in the 1998 NASCAR Winston Cup The No.7 Eggenberger Motorsport Ford Sierra RS500 of Klaus Ludwig and Klaus Niedzwiedz. Eggenberger Motorsport won the 1987 WTCC Entrants Championship Texaco is associated with the Havoline brand of motor oil and other automotive products. It was one of the sponsors of NASCAR with many drivers, such as Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett; Kenny Irwin, Jr.; Ricky Rudd, Jamie McMurray, Casey Mears, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Texaco recently sponsored the #42 Dodge driven by Montoya. Havoline continuously sponsored a car from the early 1980s to 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Texaco / Havoline officially ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and Chip Ganassi Racing. This brought a 20+ year relationship with the sport to a close. Texaco has also been involved in open wheel racing, sponsoring the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston along with sponsoring drivers like Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti and his son Michael. In Formula One, Texaco sponsored the Team Lotus in 1972 and 1973, and McLaren from 1974 to 1978. The company returned to Grand Prix racing at a smaller scale in 1997, with their brands appearing on the Stewart SF01 car. Their association with the team and its successor, Jaguar Racing, continued until the end of 2001, in the same timeline they also sponsored ITV's Formula 1 Coverage. Texaco sponsored the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Rover Vitesse factory team at the 1985 and 1986 European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) under their Bastos brand, and the Ford Sierra RS500 factory cars entered by Eggenberger Motorsport in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship (plus the 1988 ETCC and other European-based championships). Texaco also sponsored cars in the 1987 World Rally Championship. From 1987-1993, Texaco was the major sponsor (through their Australian Caltex offshoot) Colin Bond Racing in Australian touring car racing, first with the Alfa Romeo 75 turbo in 1987, then the Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988-1992 and then Toyota's in 1993. From 2000 until 2007, it was title sponsor of Stone Brothers Racing with Russell Ingall winning the 2005 championship. In 2016, Caltex became title sponsor of the Triple Eight Race Engineering car of Craig Lowndes, having previously been an associate sponsor of the team. Texaco was long associated with the Metropolitan Opera as sole sponsor of its radio broadcasts for 63 years. It was identified as well with such entertainment legends as Ed Wynn, Fred Allen and Milton Berle (many of their shows were originally sponsored by Texaco ‚Äì see Texaco Star Theatre, which includes the sponsorship lyrics of the opening theme: \\"We're the men of Texaco, We work from Maine to Mexico...\\"). Berle's program was broadcast in the same time slot as Fulton J. Sheen's religious program for a while, thus leading to Berle's oft-quoted quip, \\"We both have the same boss ‚Äì Sky Chief!\\" From 1984 to 1998, Texaco were the title sponsors of the main One Day International cricket tournament in England, the Texaco Trophy. It also sponsored the Texaco Cup, a football tournament for clubs of the British Isles. Environmental issues From 1965‚Äì1993, Texaco participated in a consortium to develop the Lago Agrio oil field in Ecuador. It has been accused of extensive environmental damage from these operations, and faces legal claims from both private plaintiffs and the government of Ecuador. The case has been widely publicized by environmental activists and is the subject of Crude, a 2009 documentary film by Joe Berlinger. Chevron claims that it is being unfairly targeted as a deep pocket defendant, when the actual responsibility lies with the government and its national oil company, Petroecuador. Diversification The NiMH chemistry used in modern hybrid vehicles was invented by ECD Ovonics founder, Stan Ovshinsky, and Dr. Masahiko Oshitani of the Yuasa Company In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics's battery development and manufacturing. On October 10, 2001, Texaco purchased GM's share in GM Ovonics, and Chevron completed its acquisition of Texaco six days later. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics.Roberson, J.

The word is usually used in reference to a kind of fret in architecture, or to a badge or insignia used in military or police uniforms to indicate rank or length of service, or in heraldry and the designs of flags (see flag terminology). Ancient history The chevron occurs in early art including designs on pottery and rock carvings. Examples can be found approximately 1800 BC in archaeological recovery of pottery designs from the palace of Knossos on Crete in the modern day country of Greece.C.Michael Hogan (2007) Knossos Fieldnotes The Modern Antiquarian Also, the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma produced pottery with decorative repertoire confined to geometric designs such as Chevrons. Sparta (Lacedaemonia ()) used a capital lambda () on their shields.  Heraldry  A chevron is one of the ordinaries in heraldry, one of the simple geometrical figures which are the chief images in many coat of arms. A chevron is constructed by choosing a visually appealing angle such as the Golden Angle or any other angle the artist prefers. It can be subject to a number of modifications including inversion. When the ends are cut off in a way that looks like the splintered ends of a broken piece of wood, with an irregular zig-zag pattern, it is called √©clat√©.An example is said to appear in the arms of Blanluz, in Dauphin√©. When shown as a smaller size than standard, it is a diminutive called a chevronel. Chevrons appeared early in the history of heraldry, especially in Normandy. In Scandinavia the chevron is known as sparre; an early example appears in the arms of Armand desmondly.

One chevron usually designates a private or lance corporal, two a corporal, and three a sergeant. One to four \\"rockers\\" may also be incorporated to indicate various grades of sergeant. In the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, chevrons typically point towards the neck (though prior to the 20th Century this was not true); in the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard, and in Commonwealth usage, they usually point away from the neck. In the Commonwealth, the correct terminology for rank chevrons includes the number of stripes, called \\"bars\\", therefore, the sergeants' insignia is properly termed a \\"3-bar chevron\\". Canadian and Australian Forces often refer to chevrons as \\"hooks\\". In the Dutch armed forces they are nicknamed \\"bananas\\".See Infanterist 1939-1940: rangen - Het Nederlandsche Leger 1939-1940 , 2012 In the British Army, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, chevrons are worn point down to denote NCO rank, with one for lance corporal, two for corporal, three for sergeant, and three with a crown for Staff Sergeant (known as Colour Sergeant in infantry regiments and the Royal Marines) or Flight Sergeant (RAF). Branch and tradition results in variations in rank titles (Corporal of Horse being the equivalent of Sergeant in the Household Cavalry) and spellings (Serjeant in The Rifles). Large chevrons are also worn on the sleeves of Royal Navy sailors to denote good conduct rather than rank. Although usually associated with Non-Commissioned Officers, the chevron was originally used as an insignia to denote General Officer ranks in the British Army. It was adopted from the insignia worn by cavalry during the 18th Century, in particular the Household Cavalry. It was worn on the cuffs, forearms and tails of their coats, embroidered in gold bullion for the guards and silver for Dragoons Regiments. George III favoured the uniform of the Horse Guards, and his Windsor Uniform followed a similar pattern. After 1768, a similar pattern uniform as worn the King was introduced to General Officers, with the number and spacing of the chevrons denoting rank. For example, a Major General would wear his chevrons in pairs: two on the sleeves, and two on the tails. A Lieutenant General would wear them in groups of three, and a full General's would be equidistant. This practice continued into the early Victorian Era.

It is used in several national flags, including the flag of Cuba, the flag of the Czech Republic, and the flag of Jordan, as a few examples.  Other uses as insignia  In some armies, small chevrons are worn on the lower left sleeve to indicate length of service, akin to service stripes in the U.S. military. The Israel Defense Forces use chevrons in various orientations as organizational designators on their vehicles, specifically which company within a battalion they belong to. French car maker, Citro√´n uses a double chevron as its logo. Chevrons on their side are also used as road signs to denote bends. From the early 1950s until the early 2000s, Simplex, Faraday and many other companies manufactured the chevron series fire alarm manual pull station. The handle was shaped in a way where the handle looked like an inverted chevron.

In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered exception handler; the details of how this is done depend on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. It is provided by specialized programming language constructs, hardware mechanisms like interrupts, or operating system (OS) inter-process communication (IPC) facilities like signals. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted. An alternative approach to exception handling in software is error checking, which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies reported using special return values, an auxiliary global variable such as Cs errno, or floating point status flags. Input validation, which preemptively filters exceptional cases, is also an approach.  In hardware  Hardware exception mechanisms are processed by the CPU. It is intended to support, e.g., error detection, and redirects the program flow to error handling service routines. The state before the exception is saved, e.g., on the stack.  Hardware exception handling/traps: IEEE 754 floating point  Exception handling in the IEEE 754 floating point hardware standard refers in general to exceptional conditions and defines an exception as \\"an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application. That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.\\" By default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation. The IEEE 754 standard uses the term \\"trapping\\" to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard. The standard recommends several usage scenarios for this, including the implementation of non-default pre-substitution of a value followed by resumption, to concisely handle removable singularities. The default IEEE 754 exception handling behaviour of resumption following pre- substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, in 1996 the maiden flight of the Ariane 5 (Flight 501) ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada programming language exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error, which in this case was a 64-bit floating point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow. In the Ariane Flight 501 case, the programmers protected only four out of seven critical variables against overflow due to concerns about the computational constraints of the on-board computer and relied on what turned out to be incorrect assumptions about the possible range of values for the three unprotected variables because they reused code from the Ariane 4, for which their assumptions were correct. According to William Kahan, the loss of Flight 501 would have been avoided if the IEEE 754 exception-handling policy of default substitution had been used because the overflowing 64-bit to 16-bit conversion that caused the software to abort occurred in a piece of code that turned out to be completely unnecessary on the Ariane 5. The official report on the crash (conducted by an inquiry board headed by Jacques-Louis Lions) noted that \\"An underlying theme in the development of Ariane 5 is the bias towards the mitigation of random failure. The supplier of the inertial navigation system (SRI) was only following the specification given to it, which stipulated that in the event of any detected exception the processor was to be stopped. The exception which occurred was not due to random failure but a design error. The exception was detected, but inappropriately handled because the view had been taken that software should be considered correct until it is shown to be at fault. [...] Although the failure was due to a systematic software design error, mechanisms can be introduced to mitigate this type of problem. For example the computers within the SRIs could have continued to provide their best estimates of the required attitude information. There is reason for concern that a software exception should be allowed, or even required, to cause a processor to halt while handling mission-critical equipment. Indeed, the loss of a proper software function is hazardous because the same software runs in both SRI units. In the case of Ariane 501, this resulted in the switch-off of two still healthy critical units of equipment.\\" From the processing point of view, hardware interrupts are similar to resumable exceptions, though they are typically unrelated to the user program's control flow.  Exception handling facilities provided by the operating system  Unix-like operating systems provide facilities for handling exceptions in programs via IPC. Typically, interrupts caused by the execution of a process are handled by the interrupt service routines of the operating system, and the operating system may then send a signal to that process, which may have asked the operating system to register a signal handler to be called when the signal is raised, or let the operating system execute a default action (like terminating the program). Typical examples are SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL and SIGFPE. Other operating systems, e.g., OS/360 and successors, may uses different approaches in place of or in addition to IPC.  In software  Software exception handling and the support provided by software tools differs somewhat from what is understood by exception handling in hardware, but similar concepts are involved. In programming language mechanisms for exception handling, the term exception is typically used in a specific sense to denote a data structure storing information about an exceptional condition. One mechanism to transfer control, or raise an exception, is known as a throw. The exception is said to be thrown. Execution is transferred to a \\"catch\\". From the point of view of the author of a routine, raising an exception is a useful way to signal that a routine could not execute normally - for example, when an input argument is invalid (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function) or when a resource it relies on is unavailable (like a missing file, a hard disk error, or out- of-memory errors), or that the routine has detected a normal condition that requires special handling, e.g., attention, end of file. In systems without exceptions, routines would need to return some special error code. However, this is sometimes complicated by the semipredicate problem, in which users of the routine need to write extra code to distinguish normal return values from erroneous ones. Programming languages differ substantially in their notion of what an exception is. Contemporary languages can roughly be divided into two groups: * Languages where exceptions are designed to be used as flow control structures: Ada, Java, Modula-3, ML, OCaml, PL/I, Python, and Ruby fall in this category. * Languages where exceptions are only used to handle abnormal, unpredictable, erroneous situations: C++, C#, Common Lisp, Eiffel, and Modula-2. Kiniry also notes that \\"Language design only partially influences the use of exceptions, and consequently, the manner in which one handles partial and total failures during system execution. The other major influence is examples of use, typically in core libraries and code examples in technical books, magazine articles, and online discussion forums, and in an organization‚Äôs code standards.\\" Contemporary applications face many design challenges when considering exception handling strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid exception handling strategy is recognizing when a process has failed to the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.All Exceptions Are Handled, Jim Wilcox,  History  Software exception handling developed in Lisp in the 1960s and 1970s. This originated in LISP 1.5 (1962), where exceptions were caught by the \`ERRSET\` keyword, which returned \`NIL\` in case of an error, instead of terminating the program or entering the debugger. Error raising was introduced in MacLisp in the late 1960s via the \`ERR\` keyword. This was rapidly used not only for error raising, but for non- local control flow, and thus was augmented by two new keywords, \`CATCH\` and \`THROW\` (MacLisp June 1972), reserving \`ERRSET\` and \`ERR\` for error handling. The cleanup behavior now generally called \\"finally\\" was introduced in NIL (New Implementation of LISP) in the mid- to late-1970s as \`UNWIND-PROTECT\`. This was then adopted by Common Lisp. Contemporary with this was \`dynamic-wind\` in Scheme, which handled exceptions in closures. The first papers on structured exception handling were and . Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward. PL/I used dynamically scoped exceptions, however more recent languages use lexically scoped exceptions. PL/I exception handling included events that are not errors, e.g., attention, end-of-file, modification of listed variables. While some more recent languages support non-error exceptions, their use is not common. Originally, software exception handling included both resumable exceptions (resumption semantics), like most hardware exceptions, and non- resumable exceptions (termination semantics). However, resumption semantics were considered ineffective in practice in the 1970s and 1980s (see C++ standardization discussion, quoted below) and are no longer in common use, though provided by programming languages like Common Lisp,Dylan and PL/I.  Termination semantics  Exception handling mechanisms in contemporary languages are typically non-resumable (\\"termination semantics\\") as opposed to hardware exceptions, which are typically resumable. This is based on experience of using both, as there are theoretical and design arguments in favor of either decision; these were extensively debated during C++ standardization discussions 1989‚Äì1991, which resulted in a definitive decision for termination semantics. On the rationale for such a design for the C++ mechanism, Stroustrup notes:  Criticism  A contrasting view on the safety of exception handling was given by Tony Hoare in 1980, describing the Ada programming language as having \\"...a plethora of features and notational conventions, many of them unnecessary and some of them, like exception handling, even dangerous. [...] Do not allow this language in its present state to be used in applications where reliability is critical [...]. The next rocket to go astray as a result of a programming language error may not be an exploratory space rocket on a harmless trip to Venus: It may be a nuclear warhead exploding over one of our own cities.\\"C.A.R. Hoare. \\"The Emperor's Old Clothes\\". 1980 Turing Award Lecture Exception handling is often not handled correctly in software, especially when there are multiple sources of exceptions; data flow analysis of 5 million lines of Java code found over 1300 exception handling defects. Citing multiple prior studies by others (1999‚Äì2004) and their own results, Weimer and Necula wrote that a significant problem with exceptions is that they \\"create hidden control-flow paths that are difficult for programmers to reason about\\". Go was initially released with exception handling explicitly omitted, with the developers arguing that it obfuscated control flow. Later, the exception-like / mechanism was added to the language, which the Go authors advise using only for unrecoverable errors that should halt the entire process.Panic And Recover , Go wiki Exceptions, as unstructured flow, increase the risk of resource leaks (such as escaping a section locked by a mutex, or one temporarily holding a file open) or inconsistent state. There are various techniques for resource management in the presence of exceptions, most commonly combining the dispose pattern with some form of unwind protection (like a \`finally\` clause), which automatically releases the resource when control exits a section of code.  Exception support in programming languages  Many computer languages have built-in support for exceptions and exception handling. This includes ActionScript, Ada, BlitzMax, C++, C#, Clojure, COBOL, D, ECMAScript, Eiffel, Java, ML, Next Generation Shell, Object Pascal (e.g. Delphi, Free Pascal, and the like), PowerBuilder, Objective-C, OCaml, PHP (as of version 5), PL/I, PL/SQL, Prolog, Python, REALbasic, Ruby, Scala, Seed7, Smalltalk, Tcl, Visual Prolog and most .NET languages. Exception handling is commonly not resumable in those languages, and when an exception is thrown, the program searches back through the stack of function calls until an exception handler is found. Some languages call for unwinding the stack as this search progresses. That is, if function , containing a handler for exception , calls function , which in turn calls function , and an exception occurs in , then functions and may be terminated, and in will handle . Exception-handling languages without this unwinding are Common Lisp with its Condition System, PL/I and Smalltalk. All call the exception handler and do not unwind the stack; however, in PL/I, if the \\"ON unit\\" (exception handler) does a GOTO out of the ON unit, that will unwind the stack. The exception handler has the option to restart the computation, resume or unwind. This allows the program to continue the computation at exactly the same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available) or to implement notifications, logging, queries and fluid variables on top of the exception handling mechanism (as done in Smalltalk). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding. Excluding minor syntactic differences, there are only a couple of exception handling styles in use. In the most popular style, an exception is initiated by a special statement (\`throw\` or \`raise\`) with an exception object (e.g. with Java or Object Pascal) or a value of a special extendable enumerated type (e.g. with Ada or SML). The scope for exception handlers starts with a marker clause (\`try\` or the language's block starter such as \`begin\`) and ends in the start of the first handler clause (\`catch\`, \`except\`, \`rescue\`). Several handler clauses can follow, and each can specify which exception types it handles and what name it uses for the exception object. A few languages also permit a clause (\`else\`) that is used in case no exception occurred before the end of the handler's scope was reached. More common is a related clause (\`finally\` or \`ensure\`) that is executed whether an exception occurred or not, typically to release resources acquired within the body of the exception-handling block. Notably, C++ does not provide this construct, since it encourages the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) technique which frees resources using destructors. In its whole, exception handling code might look like this (in Java-like pseudocode): try { line = console.readLine(); if (line.length()  0) { throw new EmptyLineException(\\"The line read from console was empty!\\"); } console.printLine(\\"Hello %s!\\" % line); console.printLine(\\"The program ran successfully.\\"); } catch (EmptyLineException e) { console.printLine(\\"Hello!\\"); } catch (Exception e) { console.printLine(\\"Error: \\" + e.message()); } finally { console.printLine(\\"The program is now terminating.\\"); } As a minor variation, some languages use a single handler clause, which deals with the class of the exception internally. According to a 2008 paper by Westley Weimer and George Necula, the syntax of the \`try\`...\`finally\` blocks in Java is a contributing factor to software defects. When a method needs to handle the acquisition and release of 3‚Äì5 resources, programmers are apparently unwilling to nest enough blocks due to readability concerns, even when this would be a correct solution. It is possible to use a single \`try\`...\`finally\` block even when dealing with multiple resources, but that requires a correct use of sentinel values, which is another common source of bugs for this type of problem. Regarding the semantics of the \`try\`...\`catch\`...\`finally\` construct in general, Weimer and Necula write that \\"While try-catch-finally is conceptually simple, it has the most complicated execution description in the language specification [Gosling et al. 1996] and requires four levels of nested ‚Äúif‚Äùs in its official English description. In short, it contains a large number of corner cases that programmers often overlook.\\" C supports various means of error checking, but generally is not considered to support \\"exception handling,\\" although the \`setjmp\` and \`longjmp\` standard library functions can be used to implement exception semantics. Perl has optional support for structured exception handling. Python's support for exception handling is pervasive and consistent. It's difficult to write a robust Python program without using its and keywords.  Exception handling in UI hierarchies  Recent front-end web frameworks, such as React and Vue, have introduced error handling mechanisms where errors propagate up the UI component hierarchy, in a way that is analogous to how errors propagate up the call stack in executing code. Here the error boundary mechanism serves as an analogue to the typical try-catch mechanism. Thus a component can ensure that errors from its child components are caught and handled, and not propagated up to parent components. For example, in Vue, a component would catch errors by implementing \`errorCaptured\` Vue.component('parent', { template: ' ', errorCaptured: (err, vm, info) => alert('An error occurred'); }) Vue.component('child', { template: ' ' }) When used like this in markup: The error produced by the child component is caught and handled by the parent component.  Exception handling implementation  The implementation of exception handling in programming languages typically involves a fair amount of support from both a code generator and the runtime system accompanying a compiler. (It was the addition of exception handling to C++ that ended the useful lifetime of the original C++ compiler, Cfront.Scott Meyers, The Most Important C++ Software...Ever , 2006) Two schemes are most common. The first, dynamic registration, generates code that continually updates structures about the program state in terms of exception handling.D. Cameron, P. Faust, D. Lenkov, M. Mehta, \\"A portable implementation of C++ exception handling\\", Proceedings of the C++ Conference (August 1992) USENIX. Typically, this adds a new element to the stack frame layout that knows what handlers are available for the function or method associated with that frame; if an exception is thrown, a pointer in the layout directs the runtime to the appropriate handler code. This approach is compact in terms of space, but adds execution overhead on frame entry and exit. It was commonly used in many Ada implementations, for example, where complex generation and runtime support was already needed for many other language features. Dynamic registration, being fairly straightforward to define, is amenable to proof of correctness.Graham Hutton, Joel Wright, \\"Compiling Exceptions Correctly \\". Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction, 2004. The second scheme, and the one implemented in many production-quality C++ compilers, is a table-driven approach. This creates static tables at compile time and link time that relate ranges of the program counter to the program state with respect to exception handling. Then, if an exception is thrown, the runtime system looks up the current instruction location in the tables and determines what handlers are in play and what needs to be done. This approach minimizes executive overhead for the case where an exception is not thrown. This happens at the cost of some space, but this space can be allocated into read-only, special-purpose data sections that are not loaded or relocated until an exception is actually thrown. This second approach is also superior in terms of achieving thread safety. Other definitional and implementation schemes have been proposed as well.\\"\\", Intel Corporation. For languages that support metaprogramming, approaches that involve no overhead at all (beyond the already present support for reflection) have been advanced.M. Hof, H. M√∂ssenb√∂ck, P. Pirkelbauer, \\"Zero-Overhead Exception Handling Using Metaprogramming \\", Proceedings SOFSEM'97, November 1997, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 1338, pp. 423-431.  Exception handling based on design by contract  A different view of exceptions is based on the principles of design by contract and is supported in particular by the Eiffel language. The idea is to provide a more rigorous basis for exception handling by defining precisely what is \\"normal\\" and \\"abnormal\\" behavior. Specifically, the approach is based on two concepts: * Failure: the inability of an operation to fulfill its contract. For example, an addition may produce an arithmetic overflow (it does not fulfill its contract of computing a good approximation to the mathematical sum); or a routine may fail to meet its postcondition. * Exception: an abnormal event occurring during the execution of a routine (that routine is the \\"recipient\\" of the exception) during its execution. Such an abnormal event results from the failure of an operation called by the routine. The \\"Safe Exception Handling principle\\" as introduced by Bertrand Meyer in Object-Oriented Software Construction then holds that there are only two meaningful ways a routine can react when an exception occurs: * Failure, or \\"organized panic\\": The routine fixes the object's state by re-establishing the invariant (this is the \\"organized\\" part), and then fails (panics), triggering an exception in its caller (so that the abnormal event is not ignored). * Retry: The routine tries the algorithm again, usually after changing some values so that the next attempt will have a better chance to succeed. In particular, simply ignoring an exception is not permitted; a block must either be retried and successfully complete, or propagate the exception to its caller. Here is an example expressed in Eiffel syntax. It assumes that a routine is normally the better way to send a message, but it may fail, triggering an exception; if so, the algorithm next uses , which will fail less often. If fails, the routine as a whole should fail, causing the caller to get an exception. send (m: MESSAGE) is  Send m through fast link, if possible, otherwise through slow link. local tried_fast, tried_slow: BOOLEAN do if tried_fast then tried_slow := True send_slow (m) else tried_fast := True send_fast (m) end rescue if not tried_slow then retry end end The boolean local variables are initialized to False at the start. If fails, the body ( clause) will be executed again, causing execution of . If this execution of fails, the clause will execute to the end with no (no clause in the final ), causing the routine execution as a whole to fail. This approach has the merit of defining clearly what \\"normal\\" and \\"abnormal\\" cases are: an abnormal case, causing an exception, is one in which the routine is unable to fulfill its contract. It defines a clear distribution of roles: the clause (normal body) is in charge of achieving, or attempting to achieve, the routine's contract; the clause is in charge of reestablishing the context and restarting the process, if this has a chance of succeeding, but not of performing any actual computation. Although exceptions in Eiffel have a fairly clear philosophy, Kiniry (2006) criticizes their implementation because \\"Exceptions that are part of the language definition are represented by INTEGER values, developer-defined exceptions by STRING values. [...] Additionally, because they are basic values and not objects, they have no inherent semantics beyond that which is expressed in a helper routine which necessarily cannot be foolproof because of the representation overloading in effect (e.g., one cannot differentiate two integers of the same value).\\"  Uncaught exceptions  If an exception is thrown and not caught (operationally, an exception is thrown when there is no applicable handler specified), the uncaught exception is handled by the runtime; the routine that does this is called the '.Mac Developer Library, \\"Uncaught Exceptions \\"MSDN, AppDomain.UnhandledException Event The most common default behavior is to terminate the program and print an error message to the console, usually including debug information such as a string representation of the exception and the stack trace.The Python Tutorial, \\"8. Errors and Exceptions \\" This is often avoided by having a top-level (application-level) handler (for example in an event loop) that catches exceptions before they reach the runtime.PyMOTW (Python Module Of The Week), \\"Exception Handling \\" Note that even though an uncaught exception may result in the program terminating abnormally (the program may not be correct if an exception is not caught, notably by not rolling back partially completed transactions, or not releasing resources), the process terminates normally (assuming the runtime works correctly), as the runtime (which is controlling execution of the program) can ensure orderly shutdown of the process. In a multithreaded program, an uncaught exception in a thread may instead result in termination of just that thread, not the entire process (uncaught exceptions in the thread-level handler are caught by the top-level handler). This is particularly important for servers, where for example a servlet (running in its own thread) can be terminated without the server overall being affected. This default uncaught exception handler may be overridden, either globally or per-thread, for example to provide alternative logging or end-user reporting of uncaught exceptions, or to restart threads that terminate due to an uncaught exception. For example, in Java this is done for a single thread via \`Thread.setUncaughtExceptionHandler\` and globally via \`Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler\`; in Python this is done by modifying \`sys.excepthook\`.  Static checking of exceptions  = Checked exceptions = The designers of Java devised checked exceptions,Java Language Specification, chapter 11.2. http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/exceptions.html#11.2 which are a special set of exceptions. The checked exceptions that a method may raise are part of the method's signature. For instance, if a method might throw an , it must declare this fact explicitly in its method signature. Failure to do so raises a compile-time error. Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java's libraries (as they were in 2006) were often inconsistent in their approach to error reporting, because \\"Not all erroneous situations in Java are represented by exceptions though. Many methods return special values which indicate failure encoded as constant field of related classes.\\" Checked exceptions are related to exception checkers that exist for the OCaml programming language. The external tool for OCaml is both invisible (i.e. it does not require any syntactic annotations) and optional (i.e. it is possible to compile and run a program without having checked the exceptions, although this is not recommended for production code). The CLU programming language had a feature with the interface closer to what Java has introduced later. A function could raise only exceptions listed in its type, but any leaking exceptions from called functions would automatically be turned into the sole runtime exception, , instead of resulting in compile-time error. Later, Modula-3 had a similar feature. These features don't include the compile time checking that is central in the concept of checked exceptions, and hasn't (as of 2006) been incorporated into major programming languages other than Java. Early versions of the C++ programming language included an optional mechanism for checked exceptions, called exception specifications. By default any function could throw any exception, but this was limited by a clause added to the function signature, that specified which exceptions the function may throw. Exception specifications were not enforced at compile-time. Violations resulted in the global function being called.Bjarne Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language Third Edition, Addison Wesley, 1997. . pp. 375-380. An empty exception specification could be given, which indicated that the function will throw no exception. This was not made the default when exception handling was added to the language because it would have required too much modification of existing code, would have impeded interaction with code written in other languages, and would have tempted programmers into writing too many handlers at the local level. Explicit use of empty exception specifications could, however, allow C++ compilers to perform significant code and stack layout optimizations that generally have to be suppressed when exception handling may take place in a function. Some analysts viewed the proper use of exception specifications in C++ as difficult to achieve. In the C++ language standard (C++11), this use of exception specifications as specified in the C++03 version of the standard was deprecated and was removed from the language in C++17. A function that will not throw any exceptions can now be denoted by the noexcept keyword. In contrast to Java, languages like C# do not require declaration of any exception type. According to Hanspeter M√∂ssenb√∂ck, not distinguishing between to-be-called (checked) exceptions and not-to-be-called (unchecked) exceptions makes the written program more convenient, but less robust, as an uncaught exception results in an abort with a stack trace. Kiniry (2006) notes however that Java's JDK (version 1.4.1) throws a large number of unchecked exceptions: one for every 140 lines of code, whereas Eiffel uses them much more sparingly, with one thrown every 4,600 lines of code. Kiniry also writes that \\"As any Java programmer knows, the volume of \`try catch\` code in a typical Java application is sometimes larger than the comparable code necessary for explicit formal parameter and return value checking in other languages that do not have checked exceptions. In fact, the general consensus among in-the-trenches Java programmers is that dealing with checked exceptions is nearly as unpleasant a task as writing documentation. Thus, many programmers report that they ‚Äúresent‚Äù checked exceptions. This leads to an abundance of checked-but-ignored exceptions\\". Kiniry also notes that the developers of C# apparently were influenced by this kind of user experiences, with the following quote being attributed to them (via Eric Gunnerson): According to Anders Hejlsberg there was fairly broad agreement in their design group to not have checked exceptions as a language feature in C#. Hejlsberg explained in an interview that = Views on usage = Checked exceptions can, at compile time, reduce the incidence of unhandled exceptions surfacing at runtime in a given application. Unchecked exceptions (such as the Java objects and ) remain unhandled. However, checked exceptions can either require extensive declarations, revealing implementation details and reducing encapsulation, or encourage coding poorly considered blocks that can hide legitimate exceptions from their appropriate handlers. Consider a growing codebase over time. An interface may be declared to throw exceptions X and Y. In a later version of the code, if one wants to throw exception Z, it would make the new code incompatible with the earlier uses. Furthermore, with the adapter pattern, in which one body of code declares an interface that is then implemented by a different body of code so that code can be plugged in and called by the first, the adapter code may have a rich set of exceptions to describe problems, but is forced to use the exception types declared in the interface. It is possible to reduce the number of declared exceptions either by declaring a superclass of all potentially thrown exceptions, or by defining and declaring exception types that are suitable for the level of abstraction of the called methodBloch 2001:178 and mapping lower level exceptions to these types, preferably wrapped using exception chaining in order to preserve the root cause. In addition, it's very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method's implicit interface anyway. Using a declaration or is usually sufficient for satisfying the checking in Java. While this may have some use, it essentially circumvents the checked exception mechanism, which Oracle discourages. Unchecked exception types should generally not be handled, except possibly at the outermost levels of scope. These often represent scenarios that do not allow for recovery: s frequently reflect programming defects,Bloch 2001:172 and s generally represent unrecoverable JVM failures. Even in a language that supports checked exceptions, there are cases where the use of checked exceptions is not appropriate.  Dynamic checking of exceptions  The point of exception handling routines is to ensure that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that exception handling routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write exception handling routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s). In order to ensure that meaningful regression analysis can be conducted throughout a software development lifecycle process, any exception handling testing should be highly automated, and the test cases must be generated in a scientific, repeatable fashion. Several commercially available systems exist that perform such testing. In runtime engine environments such as Java or .NET, there exist tools that attach to the runtime engine and every time that an exception of interest occurs, they record debugging information that existed in memory at the time the exception was thrown (call stack and heap values). These tools are called automated exception handling or error interception tools and provide 'root- cause' information for exceptions.  Exception synchronicity  Somewhat related with the concept of checked exceptions is exception synchronicity. Synchronous exceptions happen at a specific program statement whereas asynchronous exceptions can raise practically anywhere.Safe asynchronous exceptions for Python. It follows that asynchronous exception handling can't be required by the compiler. They are also difficult to program with. Examples of naturally asynchronous events include pressing Ctrl-C to interrupt a program, and receiving a signal such as \\"stop\\" or \\"suspend\\" from another thread of execution. Programming languages typically deal with this by limiting asynchronicity, for example Java has deprecated the use of its ThreadDeath exception that was used to allow one thread to stop another one. Instead, there can be semi-asynchronous exceptions that only raise in suitable locations of the program or synchronously.  Condition systems  Common Lisp, Dylan and Smalltalk have a condition system (see Common Lisp Condition System) that encompasses the aforementioned exception handling systems. In those languages or environments the advent of a condition (a \\"generalisation of an error\\" according to Kent Pitman) implies a function call, and only late in the exception handler the decision to unwind the stack may be taken. Conditions are a generalization of exceptions. When a condition arises, an appropriate condition handler is searched for and selected, in stack order, to handle the condition. Conditions that do not represent errors may safely go unhandled entirely; their only purpose may be to propagate hints or warnings toward the user. = Continuable exceptions = This is related to the so- called resumption model of exception handling, in which some exceptions are said to be continuable: it is permitted to return to the expression that signaled an exception, after having taken corrective action in the handler. The condition system is generalized thus: within the handler of a non-serious condition (a.k.a. continuable exception), it is possible to jump to predefined restart points (a.k.a. restarts) that lie between the signaling expression and the condition handler. Restarts are functions closed over some lexical environment, allowing the programmer to repair this environment before exiting the condition handler completely or unwinding the stack even partially. An example is the ENDPAGE condition in PL/I; the ON unit might write page trailer lines and header lines for the next page, then fall through to resume execution of the interrupted code. = Restarts separate mechanism from policy = Condition handling moreover provides a separation of mechanism from policy. Restarts provide various possible mechanisms for recovering from error, but do not select which mechanism is appropriate in a given situation. That is the province of the condition handler, which (since it is located in higher-level code) has access to a broader view. An example: Suppose there is a library function whose purpose is to parse a single syslog file entry. What should this function do if the entry is malformed? There is no one right answer, because the same library could be deployed in programs for many different purposes. In an interactive log-file browser, the right thing to do might be to return the entry unparsed, so the user can see it‚Äîbut in an automated log-summarizing program, the right thing to do might be to supply null values for the unreadable fields, but abort with an error, if too many entries have been malformed. That is to say, the question can only be answered in terms of the broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may establish restarts offering various ways to continue‚Äîfor instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, or to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.

The Late Egyptian spelling st≈° reflects the palatalization of ·∫ñ while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like swtj. The Coptic form of the name, Sƒìt, is the basis for the English vocalization. Set animal In art, Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal, a beast resembling no known creature, although it could be seen as a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, a jackal, or a fennec fox. The animal has a curved snout, long rectangular ears, a thin forked tail and canine body, with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe, owing to the large flat- topped \\"horns\\" which correspond to a giraffe's ossicones. The Egyptians themselves, however, made a distinction between the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is depicted as a donkey or as having a donkey's head. The earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the Amratian culture (\\"Naqada I\\") of prehistoric Egypt (3790 BC‚Äì3500 BC), though this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a ceremonial macehead of Scorpion II, a ruler of the Naqada III phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present. In the Book of the Faiyum, he is depicted with a flamingo head.Beinlich, Horst. \\"The Book of the Faiyum.\\" (2013): 27-77. pp38-39, figure 7 Conflict of Horus and Set A major element of Set's mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew, Horus, for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in \\"Contendings\\", Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son. The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text. Horus spears Set, who appears in the form of a hippopotamus, as Isis looks on The divine struggle involves many episodes. \\"Contendings\\" describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.Griffiths, J. Gwyn, \\"Osiris\\", in In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set's violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set's major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set's semen enters Horus's body and makes him ill, but in \\"Contendings\\", Horus thwarts Set by catching Set's semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus's semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set's defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival's seed and as a result \\"gives birth\\" to the disk. In \\"Contendings\\", Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth. Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities. In any case, the restoration of the Eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness,Kaper, Olaf E., \\"Myths: Lunar Cycle\\", in the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of maat. Sometimes the restoration of Horus's eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set's testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud. Protector of Ra Set spears Apep. Set was depicted standing on the prow of Ra's barge defeating the dark serpent Apep. In some Late Period representations, such as in the Persian Period Temple of Hibis at Khargah, Set was represented in this role with a falcon's head, taking on the guise of Horus. In the Amduat, Set is described as having a key role in overcoming Apep. Set in the Second Intermediate and Ramesside Periods Set and Horus adore Ramesses in the small temple at Abu Simbel. During the Second Intermediate Period (1650‚Äì1550 BCE), a group of Near Eastern peoples, known as the Hyksos (literally, \\"rulers of foreign lands\\") gained control of Lower Egypt, and ruled the Nile Delta, from Avaris. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt's chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, Hadad, as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King Apophis is recorded as worshiping Set exclusively, as described in the following passage: Jan Assmann argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a \\"lonely\\" god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil. When, c. 1522 BCE, Ahmose I overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, Egyptians' attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became xenophobic, and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set. The founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Ramesses I came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably Seti I (literally, \\"man of Set\\") and Setnakht (literally, \\"Set is strong\\"). In addition, one of the garrisons of Ramesses II held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses II erected the so- called \\"Four Hundred Years' Stele\\" at Pi-Ramesses, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta. Set also became associated with foreign gods during the New Kingdom, particularly in the delta. Set was also identified by the Egyptians with the Hittite deity Teshub, who, like Set, was a storm god. Demonization of Set Set on a late New Kingdom relief from Karnak: his figure was erased during his demonization. According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the Assyrian and Persian empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated. Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks would later associate Set with Typhon, a monstrous and evil force of raging nature. Both were sons of deities representing the Earth (Gaia and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, Zeus for Typhon). Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity. Temples Set was worshipped at the temples of Ombos (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near Kom Ombo), at Oxyrhynchus in upper Egypt, and also in part of the Fayyum area. More specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of Sepermeru, especially during the Ramesside Period.cf. Sauneron, Priests of Ancient Egypt, p. 181 There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the \\"House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru\\". One of the epithets of this town was \\"gateway to the desert\\", which fits well with Set's role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set's temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called \\"The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm\\", and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called \\"The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun\\". The two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets. Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna. The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this milieu is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another \\"House of Seth\\" and another \\"House of Nephthys\\" in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.Gardiner, Papyrus Wilbour Commentary, S28, pp. 127‚Äì128 Papyrus Bologna preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra'em-hab, Prophet of the \\"House of Seth\\" in the now-lost town of Punodjem (\\"The Sweet Place\\"). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra'em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: \\"the ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples\\".Papyrus Bologna 1094, 5,8‚Äì7, 1 Nothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts‚Äîfor example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth's consort-goddess. When, by the Twentieth Dynasty, the \\"demonization\\" of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, \\"Hwt-Sekhem\\"/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.Sauneron, Beitrage Bf. 6, 46 Seth's cult persisted even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion, in outlying but important places like Kharga, Dakhlah, Deir el- Hagar, Mut, and Kellis. In these places, Seth was considered \\"Lord of the Oasis/Town\\" and Nephthys was likewise venerated as \\"Mistress of the Oasis\\" at Seth's side, in his temples (esp. the dedication of a Nephthys-cult statue). Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as \\"Mistress\\" in the Osirian temples of these districts as part of the specifically Osirian college. It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys.

In the past the term \\"insect\\" was vaguer, and historically the definition of entomology included the study of terrestrial animals in other arthropod groups or other phyla, such as arachnids, myriapods, earthworms, land snails, and slugs. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use. Like several of the other fields that are categorized within zoology, entomology is a taxon-based category; any form of scientific study in which there is a focus on insect-related inquiries is, by definition, entomology. Entomology therefore overlaps with a cross-section of topics as diverse as molecular genetics, behavior, biomechanics, biochemistry, systematics, physiology, developmental biology, ecology, morphology, and paleontology. At some 1.3 million described species, insects account for more than two-thirds of all known organisms, some dating back around 400 million years. They have many kinds of interactions with humans and other forms of life on earth. History Plate from Transactions of the Entomological Society, 1848. These 100 Trigonopterus species were described simultaneously using DNA barcoding. Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping). The natural philosopher Pliny the Elder, (23 - 79 AD) wrote a book on the kinds of Insects, while the scientist of Kufa, Ibn al-A‚ÄòrƒÅbƒ´ (760 - 845 AD) wrote a book on flies, KitƒÅb al-DabƒÅb (). However scientific study in the modern sense began only as recently as the 16th century.Antonio Saltini, Storia delle scienze agrarie, 4 vols, Bologna 1984‚Äì89, , , , William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, Introduction to Entomology, regarded as the subject's foundational text. He also helped to found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries, and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Jean-Henri Fabre, Vladimir Nabokov, Karl von Frisch (winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner E. O. Wilson. There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance, such as Sophie Lutterlough at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with butterflies and dragonflies being the most popular. Most insects can easily be recognized to order such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles). However, insects other than Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are typically identifiable to genus or species only through the use of Identification keys and Monographs. Because the class Insecta contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 species of beetles alone) and the characteristics separating them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a microscope), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of automated species identification systems targeted on insects, for example, Daisy, ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing. In pest control In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new professional certification program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a \\"true entomologist\\" an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing a PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs or Associate Certified Entomologists. Taxonomic specialization Example of a collection barcode on a pinned beetle specimen Many entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own informal names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group: * Coleopterology ‚Äì beetles * Dipterology ‚Äì flies * Odonatology ‚Äì dragonflies and damselflies * Hemipterology ‚Äì true bugs * Isopterology ‚Äì termites * Lepidopterology ‚Äì moths and butterflies * Melittology (or Apiology) ‚Äì bees * Myrmecology ‚Äì ants * Orthopterology ‚Äì grasshoppers, crickets, etc. * Trichopterology ‚Äì caddis flies * Vespology ‚Äì Social wasps Entomologists US-American entomologists of the 1800s Organizations Like other scientific specialties, entomologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations.

Amphiboles can be green, black, colorless, white, yellow, blue, or brown. The International Mineralogical Association currently classifies amphiboles as a mineral supergroup, within which are two groups and several subgroups.Mindat, Amphibole Supergroup Mineralogy Photomicrographs of a thin section containing an amphibole crystal. In cross-polarized light on left, plane-polarized light on right. Amphiboles crystallize into two crystal systems, monoclinic and orthorhombic. In chemical composition and general characteristics they are similar to the pyroxenes. The chief differences from pyroxenes are that (i) amphiboles contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl) and (ii) the basic structure is a double chain of tetrahedra (as opposed to the single chain structure of pyroxene). Most apparent, in hand specimens, is that amphiboles form oblique cleavage planes (at around 120 degrees), whereas pyroxenes have cleavage angles of approximately 90 degrees. Amphiboles are also specifically less dense than the corresponding pyroxenes. In optical characteristics, many amphiboles are distinguished by their stronger pleochroism and by the smaller angle of extinction (Z angle c) on the plane of symmetry. Amphiboles are the primary constituent of amphibolites. In rocks Amphiboles are minerals of either igneous or metamorphic origin; in the former case occurring as constituents (hornblende) of igneous rocks, such as granite, diorite, andesite and others. Calcium is sometimes a constituent of naturally occurring amphiboles. Those of metamorphic origin include examples such as those developed in limestones by contact metamorphism (tremolite) and those formed by the alteration of other ferromagnesian minerals (hornblende). Pseudomorphs of amphibole after pyroxene are known as uralite. History and etymology The name amphibole (Ancient Greek ·ºÄŒºœÜŒØŒ≤ŒøŒªŒøœÇ - amph√≠bolos literally meaning 'double entendre', implying ambiguousness) was used by Ren√© Just Ha√ºy to include tremolite, actinolite and hornblende. The group was so named by Ha√ºy in allusion to the protean variety, in composition and appearance, assumed by its minerals. This term has since been applied to the whole group. Numerous sub-species and varieties are distinguished, the more important of which are tabulated below in two series. The formulae of each will be seen to be built on the general double-chain silicate formula RSi4O11. Four of the amphibole minerals are among the minerals commonly called asbestos. These are: anthophyllite, riebeckite, cummingtonite/grunerite series, and actinolite/tremolite series. The cummingtonite/grunerite series is often termed amosite or brown asbestos; riebeckite is known as crocidolite or blue asbestos. These are generally called amphibole asbestos.US Geological Survey, Asbestos, accessed 20 July 2015. Mining, manufacture and prolonged use of these minerals can cause serious illnesses.

Anthophyllite occurs as brownish, fibrous or lamellar masses with hornblende in mica-schist at Kongsberg in Norway and some other localities. An aluminous related species is known as gedrite and a deep green Russian variety containing little iron as kupfferite. Hornblende is an important constituent of many igneous rocks. It is also an important constituent of amphibolites formed by metamorphism of basalt. Actinolite is an important and common member of the monoclinic series, forming radiating groups of acicular crystals of a bright green or greyish-green color. It occurs frequently as a constituent of greenschists. The name (from Greek ·ºÄŒ∫œÑŒØœÇ, ·ºÄŒ∫œÑ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ/akt√≠s, akt√Ænos, a 'ray' and ŒªŒØŒ∏ŒøœÇ/l√≠thos, a 'stone') is a translation of the old German word Strahlstein (radiated stone). Glaucophane, crocidolite, riebeckite and arfvedsonite form a somewhat special group of alkali- amphiboles. The first two are blue fibrous minerals, with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and crocidolite (blue asbestos) in ironstone formations, both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes. The latter two are dark green minerals, which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium, such as nepheline-syenite and phonolite. Pargasite is a rare magnesium-rich amphibole with essential sodium, usually found in ultramafic rocks. For instance, it occurs in uncommon mantle xenoliths, carried up by kimberlite. It is hard, dense, black and usually automorphic, with a red-brown pleochroism in petrographic thin section. See also * List of minerals * Classification of minerals - Silicates Notes References * C.

needs of those who can pay for a one-time, or in most cases, a steady flow of service or product placement. In 2017 The New York Times described it as \\"the art of telling stories so enthralling that people lose track of their wallets. It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce. Marketers can direct their product to other businesses (B2B marketing) or directly to consumers (B2C marketing). Regardless of who is being marketed to, several factors apply, including the perspective the marketers will use. Known as market orientations, they determine how marketers will approach the planning stage of marketing. The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research,Market Research is a subset of Marketing Research and the characteristics of the product's target market. Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods will be used to promote the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements. The term marketing, what is commonly known as attracting customers, incorporates knowledge gained by studying the management of exchange relationships and is the business process of identifying, anticipating and satisfying customers' needs and wants. Definition Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as \\"the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large\\".Marketing definition approved in October 2007 by the American Marketing Association: . The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to market with goods for sale. From a sales process engineering perspective, marketing is \\"a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction\\".'' Philip Kotler defined marketing as \\"Satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process\\". and a decade later defines it as \\"a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they want and need through creating, offering and exchanging products of value with others\\". The Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing as \\"the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably\\". A similar concept is the value-based marketing which states the role of marketing to contribute to increasing shareholder value. In this context, marketing can be defined as \\"the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage\\". In the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling. However, because the academic study of marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science, allowing numerous universities to offer Master-of-Science (MSc) programs. The process of marketing is that of bringing a product to market, which includes these steps: broad market research; market targeting and market segmentation; determining distribution, pricing and promotion strategies; developing a communications strategy; budgeting; and visioning long-term market development goals. Many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve use of the creative arts. Concept The 'marketing concept' proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later. Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related. Given the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential: : Needs: Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self- esteem. : Wants: Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer- groups. : Demands: When needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands. Marketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer's unmet needs. Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of \\"distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.\\" Needs-based segmentation (also known as benefit segmentation) \\"places the customers' desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.\\" Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market. In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product's benefits meet the customer's needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.  B2B and B2C Marketing  The two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing.  B2B marketing  B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies. Examples of products sold through B2B marketing include: * Major equipment * Accessory equipment * Raw materials * Component parts * Processed materials * Supplies * Business services The four major categories of B2B product purchasers are: * Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys) * Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores) * Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure) * Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)  B2C marketing  Business-to- consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people. Traditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.  C2B marketing  Consumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.  C2C marketing  Customer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.  Differences in B2B and B2C marketing  The different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods. *Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer's wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs. *Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use. *Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers. *Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated. *Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer. *Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal. *Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others. *Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed. *Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products. *Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items. *Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.  Orientations  A marketing orientation has been defined as a \\"philosophy of business management.\\"Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., Developing a Market Orientation, Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11 or \\"a corporate state of mind\\"Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \\"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1‚Äì18 or as an \\"organisation[al] culture\\" Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows: * Product oriented: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. It has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \\"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\\" Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55 * Production oriented: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. It dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \\"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\\"Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Principles of Marketing, 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28 * Sales or sales- orientation: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques, largely for \\"unsought goods\\"Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., Principles of Marketing, 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29 in industrial companies.Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \\"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\\" Industrial Marketing Management, Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385‚Äì402 A 2011 meta analyses found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson's sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness , role clarity , cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role). * Marketing/Market orientation: This is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. These firm engage in extensive market research, use R&D; (Research & Development), and then utilize promotion techniques.McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \\"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\\" Business Horizons, May‚ÄìJune 1988, pp. 40‚Äì45Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \\"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\\" Journal of Business Research, Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273‚Äì85. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\\" Journal of Marketing, Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20‚Äì35 The marketing orientation includes:  Customer orientation: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm's future viability and even existence as a going concern.  Organizational orientation: The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. A marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D; department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires. The production department would then start to manufacture the product. The finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization. Societal marketing Social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. Sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing., Blackwell Reference, Kotler, P., \\"What consumerism means for marketers\\", Harvard Business Review, vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48‚Äì57; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \\"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\\" Journal of Macromarketing, Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224‚Äì32 ; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \\"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \\"4 Eras\\" of Thought Development,\\" Journal of Public Policy and Marketing, Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116‚Äì46 The Marketing Mix A marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix. The 4Ps  The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: product, price, promotion, and place.Gr√∂nroos, Christian. \\"From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing,\\" Management Decision, vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4‚Äì20. One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method. = Outline = ;Product : The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the end-user's needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. Branding, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, brand, or company. ;Pricing: This refers to the process of setting a price for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product‚Äîmonetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of pricing science. ; Place (or distribution): This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called Place or Placement, referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. ;Promotion:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; advertising, sales promotion, including promotional education, public relations, personal selling, product placement, branded entertainment, event marketing, trade shows and exhibitions. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers. The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.Borden, N., \\"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\\" Journal of Advertising Research, June 1964 pp. 2‚Äì7; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \\"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83‚Äì93 = Criticisms = One of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. An inside-out approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \\"selling\\" the organization's products and messages to the \\"outside\\" or external stakeholders.Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \\"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\\" International Journal of Advertising, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531‚Äì40 In contrast, an outside-in approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \\"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works? A theoretical review and an analysis of its main drivers and effects/ ¬øC√≥mo funciona la Comunicaci√≥n Integrada de Marketing (CIM)? Una revisi√≥n te√≥rica y un an√°lisis de sus antecedents Efectos,\\" Comunicaci√≥n y Sociedad, Vol. XXV, N√∫m. 1, 2012, pp. 313‚Äì48 From a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \\"communication\\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \\"promotion\\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either promotion or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element. Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap. Other important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.Constantinides, E., \\"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\\" Journal of Marketing Management, Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407‚Äì38 =Modifications and extensions= To overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing include \\"people\\", \\"process\\", and \\"physical evidence\\" and are often applied in the case of services marketingFisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \\"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, Journal of Retailing, vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \\"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\\" in James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), Marketing of Services, Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47‚Äì51; Rafiq,M. and Ahmed, P.K. \\"Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics\\", Marketing Intelligence & Planning, Vol. 13, no. 9, pp. 4‚Äì15 Other extensions have been found necessary in retail marketing, industrial marketing and internet marketing. * Physical- the environment customers are in when they are marketed to * People- service personnel and other customers with whom customers interact with. These people form part of the overall service experience. * Process- the way in which orders are handled, customers are satisfied and the service is delivered * Physical Evidence- the tangible examples of marketing that the customer has encountered before buying the advertised product * Productivity- the ability to provide consumers with quality product using as few resources as possible  The 4Cs  In response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model. = Outline = Consumer (or Client) The consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. Cost Cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. Convenience Like \\"Place\\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. Communication Like \\"Promotion\\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. Environment The term \\"marketing environment\\" relates to all of the factors (whether internal, external, direct or indirect) that affect a firm's marketing decision- making/planning. A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are: * The macro-environment (Macromarketing), over which a firm holds little control, consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include: economic, social, political and technological factors. A common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a PESTLE analysis, a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key macroeconomic conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.), social trends/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. * The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control, typically includes: Customers/consumers, Employees, Suppliers and the Media. In contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors. * The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself A firm's internal environment consists of: Labor, Inventory, Company Policy, Logistics, Budget, and Capital Assets. Research Marketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between marketing research and market research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research. (Avoiding the word consumer, which shows up in both,US Census data is both for Market research and for Marketing research: market research is about distribution, and marketing research is about advertising effectiveness and salesforce effectiveness). Marketing researchers use statistical methods (such as quantitative research, qualitative research, hypothesis tests, Chi-square tests, linear regression, correlation coefficients, frequency distributions, Poisson and binomial distributions, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information. The stages of research include: * Define the problem * Plan research * Research * Interpret data * Implement findings Segmentation Market segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects. The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets. Market segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position. Segmentation involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include: * Geographic (such as a country, region, city, town) * Psychographic (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour) * Demographic (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education) *Gender *Income *Life-Cycle (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z) *Lifestyle (e.g. tech savvy, active) *Behavioural (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) Once a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The DAMP acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are: * Discernable ‚Äì how a segment can be differentiated from other segments. * Accessible ‚Äì how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm * Measurable ‚Äì can the segment be quantified and its size determined? * Profitable ‚Äì can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing? The next step in the targeting process is the level of differentiation involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are: * Undifferentiated ‚Äì where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment * Differentiated ‚Äì in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment * Niche ‚Äì in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market Positioning concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. Promotional Mix The promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media * Personal selling involves a presentation given by a salesperson to an individual or a group of potential customers. It enables two-way communication and relationship building, and is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing but can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989 * Sales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include free samples, contests, premiums, trade shows, giveaways, coupons, sweepstakes and games. Depending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. * Public relations is the use of media tools to promote and monitor for a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. The goal is to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion. It can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. * Advertising occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel, directly via an in-house agency or via an advertising agency or media buying service, to publicize its product, service or message. Common examples of advertising media include: * Social media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Snapchat and YouTube allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. These platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. The Marketing Plan The area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan. Process Within the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus: * Mission Statement *SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis * Marketing Objectives * Targeted Marketing Strategy *Marketing Mix *Implementation Levels of marketing objectives within an organization As stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm. At the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a conglomerate), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period. A strategic business unit (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy. The functional level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims. Product life cycle Product lifecycle The product life cycle (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including: * A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage * No product lasts perpetually on the market * A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC In the introduction stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question. During the growth stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing. When the product hits maturity, its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales. During decline, demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued.

Both modern and non-modern roundabouts, however, may bear street names or be identified colloquially by local names such as circle, road circle, traffic circle, rotary, rotunda or island. Compared to stop signs, traffic signals, and earlier forms of roundabouts, modern roundabouts reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions greatly by reducing traffic speeds and minimizing T-bone and head-on collisions. Variations on the basic concept include integration with tram or train lines, two-way flow, higher speeds and many others. Traffic exiting the roundabout comes from one direction, instead of three, simplifying the pedestrian's visual environment. Traffic moves slowly enough to allow visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles that run on gasoline averagely spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. When entering vehicles only need to give way, they do not always perform a full stop; as a result, by keeping a part of their momentum, the engine will produce less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Research has also shown that slow-moving traffic in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake. Modern roundabouts were first standardised in the UK in 1966 and were found to be a significant improvement over previous traffic circles and rotaries. Since then they have spread and modern roundabouts are commonplace throughout the world.  History   Origins of traffic circles  The United Kingdom's first roundabout (1909) in Letchworth Garden City Circular junctions existed before roundabouts, including the Circus in the city of Bath, Somerset, England, completed in 1768, part of a world heritage site; the 1821 Governor's Circle (later renamed Monument Circle) of Indianapolis, Indiana (which gave the city the nickname \\"The Circle City\\"); the 1879 Keizer Karelplein in Nijmegen, Netherlands; the 1899 Brautwiesenplatz in G√∂rlitz, Germany; the 1907 Place de l'√âtoile around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France; the 1904 Columbus Circle in Manhattan, New York; and several circles within Washington, D.C. The operating and entry characteristics of these traffic circles differ considerably from modern roundabouts. French architect Eug√®ne H√©nard was designing one-way circular intersections as early as 1877.P. M. Wolf, Eugene Henard and the Beginning of Urbanism in Paris, 1900‚Äì1914, International Federation for Housing and Planning, The Hague, 1969, cited by Ben Hamilton- Baillie and Phil Jones, Improving traffic behaviour and safety through urban design, Proceedings of ICE ‚Äì Civil Engineering volume=158 Issue 5 May 2005 p. 41 American architect William Phelps Eno favored small traffic circles. He designed New York City's famous Columbus Circle, which was built in 1905. In 1907, architect John McLaren designed one of the first American roundabouts for both autos and streetcars (trams) in the Hanchett Residence Park in what is now San Jose, California.http://twofeet.weebly.com/walking-blog/the-five- circles-of-hanchett-park The Five Circles of Hanchett Park, 7 June 2014 The first British circular junction was built in Letchworth Garden City in 1909. The \\"longabout's\\"Mentioned 6 times in the North Hertfordshire District Council planning meeting minutes, Thursday, 23 August 2007 at 7.30 PDF of minutes, Accessed 25 March 2020 elongated circle, or pill-shaped centre was originally intended partly as a traffic island for pedestrians. Circular intersections were built in the United States, though many were large-diameter 'rotaries' that enabled high speed merge and weave maneuvers. Older-style traffic circles may control entering traffic by stop signs or traffic lights. Many allow entry at higher speeds without deflection, or require a stop and a 90-degree turn to enter. By the mid 1950s, construction of traffic circles and rotaries had ceased entirely.  Development of modern roundabouts  Widespread use of the modern roundabout began when the UK's Transport Research Laboratory engineers re-engineered and standardised circular intersections during the 1960s. Frank Blackmore led the development of the \\"priority rule\\" and subsequently invented the mini-roundabout to overcome capacity and safety limitations. The priority rule was found to improve traffic flow by up to 10%.Clint Pumphrey. \\"How Roundabouts Work\\". howstuffworks.com In 1966, the United Kingdom adopted a rule at all circular junctions that required entering traffic to give way to circulating traffic. A Transportation Research Board guide reports that the modern roundabout represents a significant improvement, in terms of both operations and safety, when compared with older rotaries and traffic circles. The design became mandatory in the United Kingdom for all new roundabouts in November 1966. Australia and other British-influenced countries were the first outside the UK to build modern roundabouts.  Spread of modern roundabouts  Next, the modern roundabout spread to France and Norway in the 1970s. When France adopted the yield-at-entry rule on national routes in 1983, the country's roundabouts proliferated. After Norway put up yield signs at all its roundabouts' entries in 1985, safety and traffic flow rapidly improved. Norwegian roundabouts increased from 15 in 1980, to 350 in 1990, to 500 in 1992. Switzerland introduced the yield-at-entry rule in 1987; its roundabouts increased from 19 in 1980 to 220 in early 1992, while 500 more were being considered. As modern roundabouts rose in popularity in the 1980s, the old traffic circles fell out of favour and many were converted into modern roundabouts or other types of intersections. In the early 1980s, single-lane roundabouts (or mini-roundabouts) were also introduced in the Netherlands. It began in the relatively sparsely populated northern and eastern Netherlands because of fears that the roundabouts would not be able to cope with the traffic density of the Randstad; however, when it appeared the single-lane roundabouts had an even higher capacity than signalised intersections, they were constructed en masse in the western Netherlands as well. The late 1980s saw significant growth with about 400 roundabouts constructed in just 6 years. Construction accelerated in the 1990s, and by 2001, there were an estimated 1,500 to 1,800 roundabouts in the Netherlands, more than half of which were located within built-up areas. In the United States modern roundabouts emerged in the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1995, the first modern roundabounts were built in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Vermont. Municipalities introducing new roundabouts often are met with some degree of public resistance, just as in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. As of December 2015 there are about 4,800 of these modern roundabouts in the United States. As an example, Washington state contains about 120 roundabouts as of October 2016, all having been built since 1997, with more planned. United States surveys show that negative public opinion reverses as drivers gain experience with roundabouts. American confusion at how to enter and especially how to exit a roundabout was the subject of mockery such as featured in the film European Vacation and the television series The Simpsons. By 2011, however, some 3,000 roundabouts had been established, with that number growing steadily. A 1998 survey of municipalities found public opinion 68% opposed prior to construction, changing thereafter to 73% in favour.Modern Roundabout Practice in the United States A 2007 survey found public support ranging from 22% to 44% prior to construction, and several years after construction was 57% to 87%. The first modern roundabout in the United States was constructed in Summerlin, Nevada in 1990. This roundabout occasioned dismay from residents, and a local news program said about it, \\"Even police agree, [roundabouts] can be confusing at times.\\" As of the beginning of the twenty-first century, roundabouts were in widespread use in Europe. For instance, in 2019 France had more than 50,000 roundabouts, while there are around 25,000 in the United Kingdom.

File:La Minerva de Guadalajara 02.JPGThe Minerva Roundabout is one of the most famous landmarks of Guadalajara, Mexico.  Modern roundabout  A \\"modern roundabout\\" is a type of looping junction in which road traffic travels in one direction around a central island and priority is given to the circulating flow. Signs usually direct traffic entering the circle to slow and to give way to traffic already on it. Because low speeds are required for traffic entering roundabouts, they are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction radially; whereas older-style traffic circles may designed to try to increase speeds, and have roads that enter the circle tangentially. Because of the requirement for low speeds, roundabouts usually are not used on controlled-access highways, but may be used on lower grades of highway such as limited-access roads. When such roads are redesigned to incorporate roundabouts, traffic speeds must be reduced via tricks such as curving the approaches. Many traffic circles have been converted to modern roundabouts, including the former Kingston traffic circle in New York and several in New Jersey.New Jersey roundabouts Others have been converted to signalised intersections, such as the Drum Hill Rotary in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, which is now six lanes wide and controlled by four separate intersections.  Terminology  The word roundabout dates from early 20th century United Kingdom. In U.S. dictionaries the terms roundabout, traffic circle, road circle and rotary are synonyms.American Heritage (\\"roundabout: Chiefly British A traffic circle.\\"), Random House (\\"roundabout: Chiefly Brit. See traffic circle.\\"), Merriam-Webster(\\"roundabout, noun: British: rotary 2\\"; \\"rotary 2: a road junction formed around a central circle about which traffic moves in one direction only‚Äîcalled also circle, traffic circle)Macmillan \\"roundabout: a circular area where three or more roads meet that you have to drive around in one direction in order to get onto another road. The American word is traffic circle or rotary.\\", (\\"roundabout: UK (US traffic circle)), Concise Oxford (rotary: N. Amer. a traffic roundabout.) However, several experts such as Leif Ourston have stressed the need to distinguish between the characteristics of the modern roundabout and the nonconforming traffic circle: The U.S. Department of Transportation also adopted the term modern roundabout to distinguish those that require entering drivers to give way to others. Many old traffic circles remain in the northeastern US. Some modern roundabouts are elongated to encompass additional streets, but traffic always flows in a loop. In the United States, traffic engineers typically use the term rotary for large-scale circular junctions between expressways or controlled-access highways. Rotaries of this type typically feature high speeds inside the circle and on the approaches. In the United States' New England region, however, \\"rotary\\" is the general term for all roundabouts, including those with modern designs. State laws in these states mandate that traffic already driving in the rotary always has the right of way. For instance, in Massachusetts, \\"Any operator of a vehicle entering a rotary intersection shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already in the intersection.\\" In Rhode Island entering vehicles \\"Yield to vehicles in the roundabout.\\" In the dialect used in the Scottish city of Dundee, circle is used to refer to roundabouts. In the Channel Islands a third type of roundabout, known as \\"Filter in Turn\\", exists. Here approaching drivers neither yield to traffic on the roundabout, as normal, nor have priority over it, but take it in turns to enter from each. Almost all of Jersey's roundabouts are of this type.https://www.gov.je/Travel/Motoring/LearnerNewDrivers/Cars/Pages/TheoryTests.aspx In the Philippines, the term rotunda or rotonda is used in referring to roundabouts.  Operation and design  The fundamental principle of modern roundabouts is that entering drivers give way to traffic within the roundabout without the need for traffic signals. Conversely, older traffic circles typically require circling drivers to give way to entering traffic. Roundabouts may also have an interior lane. Generally, exiting directly from an inner lane of a multi-lane roundabout is permitted, given that the intersecting road has as many lanes as the roundabout. By contrast, exiting from an inner lane of an older traffic circle is usually not permitted and traffic must first move into the outside lane. Vehicles circulate around the central island in one direction at speeds of . In left-hand traffic countries they circulate clockwise (looking from above); in right-hand traffic, anticlockwise. Multi-lane roundabouts are typically less than in diameter; older traffic circles and roundabout interchanges may be considerably larger. Roundabouts are roughly the same size as signalled intersections of the same capacity. Design criteria include: * Right-of-way: Whether entering or circling vehicles have the right of way. The New Jersey Driver's Manual recommends that, in the absence of flow control signs, traffic yields based on \\"historically established traffic flow patterns\\", and there are no set rules. In New England, Washington, D.C. and New York State, entering traffic yields, as is the norm in virtually all countries outside of the U.S. * Angle of entry: Angles range from glancing (tangential) that allow full-speed entry to 90 degree angles (perpendicular). * Traffic speed: High entry speeds (over ) require circulating vehicles to yield, often stopping, which lowers capacity and increases crash rates compared to modern roundabouts. * Lane changes: Allowed or not * Diameter: The greater the traffic, the larger the circle. * Island function: Parking, parks, fountains, etc.  Islands  Roundabout at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, with modern art animals on the central island, and an apron that can be used by large trucks. Modern roundabouts feature a central island and sometimes pedestrian islands at each entry or exit. = Central = A fountain dominates this roundabout in Aix- en-Provence, France. The central island may be surrounded by a truck apron that is high enough to discourage drivers from crossing over it, but low enough to allow wide or long vehicles to navigate the roundabout. The island may provide a visual barrier, to alert approaching drivers to the presence of the roundabout, and to encourage drivers to focus on the traffic in the path of the circle. A visual barrier significantly reduces the accident rate. Otherwise, vehicles anywhere in or near the circle can cause those entering to stop and wait for them to pass, even if they are opposite, which unnecessarily reduces traffic flow. The barrier may be a landscaped mound, a raised wall, a tree or tall shrubs. Road signage or flagpoles may be erected at the top of a landscaped mound. Some communities use the island for monuments, the display of large public art or for a fountain. Pedestrians may be prohibited from crossing the circling lane(s). Access to the central island requires an underpass or overpass for safety.  Art installations  Roundabouts have attracted art installations around the world: * Bend, Oregon (United States); Bend's Roundabout sculptures were honored by Americans for the Arts as among the 37 most innovative approaches to Public Art in the country. * Fuerteventura, Canary Islands (Spain); Local government displayed sculptures at several roundabouts. * Many countries in Europe (France first, but also Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, and others) show the widespread use of roundabouts as art installations. * An inventory of roundabouts in France, made by Marc Lescuyer, listed 3,328 roundabouts with artistic decor early in 2010. * The Minerva Roundabout in Guadalajara, Mexico is one of the city's most famous monuments. It features the goddess Minerva standing on a pedestal, surrounded by a large fountain, with an inscription saying \\"Justice, wisdom and strength guard this loyal city\\". * Several famous monuments in Europe, such as the Gate of Alcal√° in Madrid, Spain or the Arc du Triomphe in Paris, France, have been isolated from street traffic by means of a roundabout. * The Garces Memorial Circle in Bakersfield, California contains a statue to Father Francisco Garces. = Pedestrian = This roundabout in Shanghai, China, has a pedestrian bridge in the form of another, raised roundabout. For larger roundabouts, pedestrian islands at each entry/exit encourage drivers to slow and prepare to enter the circle. They also provide a refuge where pedestrians may pause mid-crossing.  Pedestrian crossing  Pedestrian crossings at each entry/exit may be located at least one full car length outside the circle. The extra space allows pedestrians to cross behind vehicles waiting to enter the circle, and to allow exiting vehicles to stop for pedestrians without obstruction. Each pedestrian crossing may traverse a pedestrian island for protection that also forces drivers to slow and begin to change direction, encouraging slower, safer speeds. On the island, the pedestrian crossing may become diagonal, to direct the gaze of those crossing into exiting traffic.  Bicycles  Physically separated bikeways best protect cyclists.SWOV Factsheet: Roundabouts Less optimally, terminating cycle lanes well before roundabout entrances requires cyclists to merge into the stream of motor traffic, but keeps cyclists in full view of drivers, at some cost in motor vehicle speed. Cyclists may also be permitted to use pedestrian crossings. Traditional cycle lanes increase vehicle‚Äìbicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist must look ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a pedestrian crossing. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To give way to a cyclist on the outside requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver's view in this direction, complicating the motorist's task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 studyR.

Even when cyclists use the roadway, their risk is relatively high at these junctions.Maycock, G., and Hall, R. D.

Cyclists who choose to travel on the wide sidewalk, cross roundabout arms perpendicularly, well outside the circle. A pedestrian island allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross one lane at a time.

Capacity and delays  Traffic approaching Chiverton Cross roundabout in Cornwall, UK The capacity of a roundabout varies based on entry angle, lane width, and the number of entry and circulating lanes. As with other types of junctions, operational performance depends heavily on the flow volumes from various approaches. A single-lane roundabout can handle approximately 20,000‚Äì26,000 vehicles per day, while a two-lane design supports 40,000 to 50,000. Under many traffic conditions, a roundabout operates with less delay than signalised or all-way stop approaches. Roundabouts do not stop all entering vehicles, reducing both individual and queuing delays. Throughput further improves because drivers proceed when traffic is clear without waiting for a signal to change. Roundabouts can increase delays in locations where traffic would otherwise often not be required to stop. For example, at the junction of a high-volume and a low-volume road, traffic on the busier road would stop only when cross traffic was present, otherwise not having to slow for the roundabout. When the volumes on the roadways are relatively equal, a roundabout can reduce delays, because half of the time a full stop would be required. Dedicated left turn signals (in countries where traffic drives on the right) further reduce throughput. Roundabouts can reduce delays for pedestrians compared to traffic signals, because pedestrians are able to cross during any safe gap rather than waiting for a signal. During peak flows when large gaps are infrequent, the slower speed of traffic entering and exiting can still allow crossing, despite the smaller gaps. Studies of roundabouts that replaced stop signs and/or traffic signals found that vehicle delays were reduced 13‚Äì89 percent and the proportion of vehicles that stopped was reduced 14‚Äì56 percent. Delays on major approaches increased as vehicles slowed to enter the roundabouts. Roundabouts have been found to reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 15‚Äì45 percent, nitrous oxide emissions by 21‚Äì44 percent, carbon dioxide emissions by 23‚Äì37 percent and hydrocarbon emissions by 0‚Äì42 percent. Fuel consumption was reduced by an estimated 23‚Äì34 percent. = Capacity modelling = Many countries have researched roundabout capacity. Software can help calculate capacity, delay and queues. Packages include ARCADY, Rodel, Highway Capacity Software and Sidra Intersection. ARCADY and Rodel are based on the Transport Research Laboratory mathematical model. The TRL approach is derived from empirical models based on geometric parameters and observed driver behaviour with regard to lane choice. Sidra Intersection software includes roundabout capacity models developed in Australia and the US. Research on Australian roundabouts was conducted in the 1980s at the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB). Its analytical capacity and performance models differ from the TRL model significantly, following a lane-based gap-acceptance theory including geometric parameters. Research on U.S. roundabouts sponsored by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) culminated in a capacity model that was included in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) Edition 6 and the TRB-FHWA Roundabout Informational Guide (NCHRP Report 672). The HCM Edition 6 model is based on lane-based gap-acceptance theory. A recent NCHRP survey of US state transport agencies found that Sidra Intersection is the most widely used software tool in the US for roundabout analysis.  Safety  A comparison of possible collision points on a roundabout versus a traditional intersection Small modern roundabout in the United States, where vehicles are driven on the right Roundabout in the United States with separated side lanes. Vehicles entering the roundabout give way to vehicles in the roundabout. trunk road roundabout in the UK at Carland Cross on the A30 in Cornwall. There is a free-flow lane for the A30 towards Bodmin (nearest the camera). Statistically, modern roundabouts are safer for drivers and pedestrians than both older-style traffic circles and traditional intersections. Compared with these other forms of intersections, modern roundabouts experience 39% fewer vehicle collisions, 76% fewer injuries and 90% fewer serious injuries and fatalities (according to a study of a sampling of roundabouts in the United States, when compared with the junctions they replaced). Some larger roundabouts take foot and bicycle traffic through underpasses or alternate routes. At junctions with stop signs or traffic lights, the most serious accidents are right-angle, left-turn or head-on collisions where vehicles move fast and collide at high impact angles, e.g. head-on. Roundabouts virtually eliminate those types of crashes. Instead, most crashes are glancing blows at low angles of impact. An analysisWilke, A. and Koorey, G. (2001). How Safe are Roundabouts for Cyclists? In TranSafe Issue 5, April 2001. Wellington, NZ. PDF of the New Zealand national crash database for the period 1996‚Äì2000 shows that 26% of cyclists reported injury crashes happened at roundabouts, compared to 6% at traffic signals and 13% at priority controlled junctions. The New Zealand researchers propose that low vehicle speeds, circulatory lane markings and mountable centre aprons for trucks can reduce the problem.Campbell, D., Jurisich, I., Dunn, R. 2006. Improved multi- lane roundabout designs for cyclists. Land Transport New Zealand Research Report 287. 140 pp. PDF The most common roundabout crash type for cyclists, according to the New Zealand study, involves a motor vehicle entering the roundabout and colliding with a cyclist who already is travelling around the roundabout (more than half of cyclist/roundabout crashes in New Zealand fall into this category). The next most common crash type involves motorists leaving the roundabout colliding with cyclists who are continuing farther around the perimeter.  Vision-impaired pedestrians  Poorly designed walkways increase risks for the vision-impaired, because it is more difficult than at a signalised intersection to audibly detect whether there is a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an audible sound can be generated to indicate that it is time to cross.Pedestrian Access to Modern Roundabouts: Design and Operational Issues for Pedestrians who are Blind retrieved 6/26/2010 access- board.gov This issue has led to a conflict in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. One solution is to provide manually-operated pedestrian crossing signals at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of light traffic, since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.Bill Baranowski, P.E., Pedestrian Crosswalk Signals at Roundabouts: Where are they Applicable? Signalised pedestrian crossings are normally used on large-diameter roundabout interchanges rather than small-diameter modern roundabouts.  Types of circular intersections  Large roundabouts, such as those used at motorway junctions, typically have two to six lanes and may include traffic lights to regulate flow. Some roundabouts have a divider, or subsidiary deflection island, by means of which is provided a \\"free flow\\" segregated left- (or right-) turn lane (for the UK see Design Manual for Roads and Bridges TD 51/03) between traffic moving between two adjacent roads, and traffic within the roundabout, enabling drivers to bypass the roundabout.  Gyratory system  The term \\"gyratory\\" (for example, Hanger Lane gyratory) is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for a large circular intersection with non-standard lane markings or priority arrangements, or when there are significant lengths of carriageway between the entry arms, or when buildings occupy the central island. In the 21st century several gyratory systems in London have been removed, including Tottenham HaleTransport for London https://tfl.gov.uk/info- for/media/press-releases/2014/november/tottenham-hale-improvement-works- complete and Elephant & Castle.  Smaller, small and mini- roundabouts  A small roundabout in Waterloo, Ontario. As the overall or external size of a roundabout (in the UK referred to as the Inscribed Circle Diameter ‚Äì ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy ‚Äì certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity ‚Äì for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway ‚Äì an annulus around the central island ‚Äì is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron. The smaller the roundabout, the more such mitigation measures are likely to be abused ‚Äì the less effective they will be. In the UK the minimum size for roundabouts with raised islands is 28 metre diameter ICD with a 4-metre diameter island. This threshold being driven primarily by vehicle geometry ‚Äì which is globally relatively consistent ‚Äì rather than driver behaviour, it is adopted in other jurisdictions too. Below this minimum size, the mini-roundabout prevails.  Mini-roundabouts  After developing the offside priority rule, Frank Blackmore, of the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, turned his attention to the possibility of a roundabout that could be built at sites lacking room for a conventional roundabout. A mini-roundabout in the United Kingdom, where a painted white circle is used for the centre. The arrows show the direction of traffic flow. Mini-roundabouts can incorporate a painted circle or a low dome, but must be fully traversable by vehicles. Motorists can drive over them when there is no other traffic, but it is dangerous to do so otherwise. Once the practice is established it may be difficult to discourage. Mini-roundabouts use the same right-of-way rules as standard roundabouts, but produce different driver behaviour. Mini-roundabouts are sometimes grouped in pairs (a double mini- roundabout) or in \\"chains\\", simplifying navigation of otherwise awkward junctions. In some countries road signs distinguish mini-roundabouts from larger ones. Mini-roundabouts are common in the UK, Ireland and Hong Kong (particularly on Hong Kong Island), as well as Irapuato in Mexico. As of July 2019 there are 36 roundabouts in Ontario's Waterloo Region. In the UK and also in other jurisdictions that have adopted mini-roundabouts, to drive across the central disc or dome when it is practicable to avoid it is an offence. Vehicles are required to treat the painted circle as if it were a solid island and drive around it. Section 188, referring to Road Traffic Act 1988, Section 36, and Traffic Signs Regulations & General Directions 2002, Regulations 10(1) & 16(1) Some local authorities paint double white lines around the circle to indicate this, but these require permission from the Secretary of State for Transport. The central dome also must be able to be overrun by larger vehicles. In the UK ‚Äì and also in other highway jurisdictions ‚Äì the maximum size for a mini roundabout is 28 metre ICD (inscribed circle diameter). Raindrop roundabouts A hybrid raindrop roundabout in Zagreb, Croatia, . These two roundabouts are more akin to a \\"magic roundabout\\" since the left turns need not drive through both of them. Interstate interchange in North Carolina, These roundabouts do not form a complete circle and have a raindrop or teardrop shape. They appear at U.S. Interstate interchanges to provide a free- flowing left turn to the on-ramps and eliminating the need for turn signals and lanes. Since the entry and exit slip roads are one-way, a complete circle is unnecessary. This means that drivers entering the roundabout from the bridge do not need to give way, and that prevents queuing on narrow, two-lane bridges. These roundabouts have been used at dumbbell roundabout junctions, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. Several junctions along Interstate 70 near Avon, Colorado, use teardrop roundabouts. Balcony roundabout A balcony roundabout is just an elevated roundabout. They are constructed in such a way that vulnerable road users can cross underneath the roundabout. Footpaths and cycle paths along the different roads connect to the square under the roundabout. Vulnerable road users do not interfere with motorized traffic on the roundabout, reducing the risk of collision.  Turbo roundabouts  A much applied Dutch turbo roundabout design In the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Czechia, North Macedonia and Croatia a relatively new type of two-lane roundabout designs is emerging, called \\"turbo roundabouts\\". These designs require motorists to choose their direction before entering the roundabout, thereby eliminating many conflicting paths and choices on the roundabout itself, so that traffic safety is increased, as well as speed and capacity. These designs, seen from above, typically result in a spiralling flow of traffic, giving them the collective name of turbo roundabouts. As a minor drawback turbo roundabouts are often marked out such that a U-turn by means of the roundabout is not possible for drivers approaching on certain arms. Several variations of turbo roundabouts exist. They are frequently designed for the intersection of a major road crossing a road with less traffic. An early application of the principle was a six-arm and therefore relatively large (and fast) non-circular roundabout at Stairfoot, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, which was given spiral marking about 1984. At that time the method was considered experimental and needed special consents from central authorities. The turbo roundabout was formally developed in 1996 in the Netherlands by Lambertus Fortuijn, a researcher from the Delft University of Technology. Similar roundabouts, with spiralling lane markings, have been used for many years in the UK e.g. the A176/A127 (eastbound) at Basildon, Essex (). However it was not until 1997 that the UK's national highway authorities published guidance (DMRB TA-78/97) that in effect endorsed use of spiral markings in certain circumstances. Turbo roundabouts can be built with raised lane separators (common in the Netherlands) or with lane markings only. The use of raised lane separators prevents road users from weaving (thereby reducing conflicts) but can make maneuvering more difficult for large vehicles. According to simulations, a two-lane roundabout with three exits should offer 12‚Äì20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout of the same size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research made it very clear that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it. At least 70 have been built in the Netherlands, while many turbos (or similar, lane splitting designs) can be found in southeast Asia. Alt URL Multi-lane roundabouts in the United States of America are typically required to be striped with spiral markings, as most states follow the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.  Motorways  Motorway junction with roundabout in Czechia Roundabouts are generally not appropriate for placement on motorway or freeway mainlines because the purpose of such facilities is to provide for uninterrupted traffic flow. However, roundabouts are often used for the junction between the slip roads (called ramps in North America) and the intersecting road. A single roundabout, grade separated from the mainlines, may be used to create a roundabout interchange. This type of junction is common in the UK and Ireland. Alternatively, separate roundabouts also may be used at the slip road intersections of a diamond interchange to create what often is referred to as a \\"dumbbell interchange\\", which is increasingly common in both Europe and North America due to its reduced need for wide or multiple bridges. An additional use of roundabouts for high-speed junctions is the 3-level stacked roundabout‚Äîthis is a roundabout interchange where both of the roadway mainlines are grade separated. In the United Kingdom, the M25/A3, M8/M73 and A1(M)/M18 interchanges are examples of this type. These junctions, however, have less capacity than a full free-flow interchange. A similar design to this is the three-level diamond interchange. Most junctions on Dublin's M50 motorway C-road were built using a standard roundabout interchange. The traffic volume of several of these junctions increased to a level higher than the capacity such roundabouts can accommodate, and in turn have been converted into partially or fully free flowing interchanges. One example is the Red Cow interchange. In Northern Ireland, the junction between the M1 and M12 (Craigavon connector motorway) is via a standard roundabout with a raised centre, three onslips and three offslips, and two lanes. In the city of Malm√∂, Sweden, a roundabout connects two motorways, E22 from Lund, and the Inner ring road. In the Netherlands, A6 motorway and A7 motorway used to cross near Joure using a roundabout until October 2017, when the junction was turned into a full Y-interchange.https://www.lc.nl/friesland/Video-Eerste-rit- over-het-nieuwe-knooppunt-Joure-22575041.html The junction between the A200 and the A9 uses a 3-level stacked roundabout. Near Eindhoven (the Leenderheide junction), the junction for the A2 uses a roundabout. An overpass was built for the A67 from Antwerp to Germany. Rotary interchanges operate with traffic circles rather than roundabouts. Rotary interchanges are common in New England, particularly in the state of Massachusetts, but a European example of a rotary interchange may be found in Hinwil, Switzerland. Signalised roundabouts  A major signal-controlled roundabout interchange in central Bristol, England. Vehicles drive on the left, and vehicles in the roundabout are stopped by traffic lights to allow other vehicles to enter, while an underpass permits straight-through traffic to bypass the roundabout entirely. A signalised roundabout is one where one or more entry is controlled by traffic signals, rather than by assumed priority. For each signalised entry there will also be a signalised stopline immediately upstream on the circulatory section. The signals prevent blocking on the roundabout, and balance and improve traffic capacity.UK Department for Transport, Signal Controlled Roundabouts LTN 1/09 Examples include the M50 in Dublin, the Cherry Street roundabout in Kowloon, Hong Kong, Sheriffhall Roundabout in Edinburgh, Scotland, Newton Circus in Singapore, and many of the roundabouts along the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City.  \\"Magic\\" roundabouts/ring junctions  \\"Magic roundabouts\\" direct traffic in both directions around the central island. They are officially known as \\"ring junctions\\". The first magic roundabout was constructed in 1972 in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, designed by Frank Blackmore, inventor of the mini-roundabout. The roundabout joins five roads and consists of a two-way road around the central island, with five mini-roundabouts meeting the incoming roads. The name derives from the popular children's television series, The Magic Roundabout, and is considered \\"magic\\" because traffic flows in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. This is achieved by surrounding the main island with one smaller roundabout per entry/exit street. This pattern directs traffic in the usual clockwise (in LHT installations) or counter-clockwise (in RHT installations) manner around each mini-roundabout. Exiting the mini-roundabouts, traffic may proceed around the central island either in the usual direction (via the outer loop), or in the inverse direction (the inner loop). The arrangement offers multiple paths between feeder roads. Drivers typically choose the shorter, most fluid route. Although the safety record is good, many drivers find this system intimidating, and some drivers go to great lengths to avoid them.Brits vote on the best and worst roundabouts, Easier.com. 20 December 2005, retrieved 18 January 200810 Scariest Junctions in the UK, BBC, 27 November 2009. Similar systems are found in the Moor End roundabout in Hemel Hempstead (Hertfordshire), which has six intersections; in High Wycombe (Buckinghamshire), the Denham Roundabout in Denham (Buckinghamshire), the Greenstead Roundabout in Colchester (Essex), \\"The Egg\\" in Tamworth (Staffordshire) and the Hatton Cross Roundabout in London. Churchbridge Junction in Staffordshire is a magic gyratory. This type of junction is similar to a magic roundabout, except that the constituent roundabouts are connected by longer lengths of roadway. File:Magicroundabout hemel.svgLine drawing of the \\"Magic Roundabout\\" at Hemel Hempstead illustrating the concept and the reverse (anticlockwise) flow of the inner lane File:Magic Roundabout Schild db.jpgThe Swindon Magic Roundabout  Trams  Near Nationaltheatret in Oslo, tramway cross the roundabout Haymarket roundabout, Melbourne Tram roundabouts, which are found in many countries, merge roundabouts for individual vehicles with tram lines. Large areas are needed for tram roundabouts that include a junction between tram lines. Such systems often contain tram stops. In France, tram roundabouts commonly have radii between 14 and 22 meters, although some have radii outside this range. In some cities, the tramway bisects the roundabout. The French considers that the mix of priorities makes these confusing and difficult to understand: a traditional modern roundabout gives the priority to the central ring, while tram roundabouts give priority to the central ring but higher priority still to the tramway. This generates many collisions of cars and trams, between 7 and 10 for each tram roundabout in France between 2006 and 2015 (between 0.37 and 1.01 per year). Tramways usually cross at the center of the roundabout. This requires traffic lights or special signalling granting the trams priority. However, there are also roundabouts where trams and vehicles use the same lane. Some roundabouts have a tram stop on the island. In inner Melbourne, particularly in the inner suburban area of South Melbourne, where the tram network is extensive, tram tracks always pass through the central island, with drivers required to give way to vehicles approaching from their right and to trams approaching from right angles. The Haymarket roundabout between Royal Parade and Elizabeth Street contains a tram-stop, pedestrian crossings, three entering tram lines, traffic signals to stop vehicular traffic at each crossing point when a tram is due, service roads and a pedestrian crossing. Brussels tram roundabouts employ multiple configurations. At the Barri√®re de St-Gilles (Flemish: ), tram tracks form a circle in the carriageway, while Verboekhoven and Altitude Cent (Hoogte Honderd) have reserved tram tracks inside the roundabout. At Place St√©phanie (Stefaniaplein), they go straight through the center, with a slip track up the Chauss√©e de Charleroi (Charleroisesteenweg), while at Montgomery they tunnel underneath. In Dublin, Ireland, the Red Cow interchange at the N7/M50 junction is grade-separated and is signal-controlled with secondary lanes (separate from the main roundabout) for those making left turns. The junction, the busiest in Ireland, had tram lines added to it with the opening of the Luas system in 2004. The tracks pass across one carriageway of the N7, and across the southern M50 sliproads. Trams pass every five minutes at rush hour. The roundabout was replaced with a grade-separated free flowing junction. Gothenburg, Sweden has a tram roundabout and tram stop at Korsv√§gen (the Crossroad). It carries heavy road traffic and about one tram or bus per minute passes in each direction. This is further complicated by separated rights-of-way for trams and buses and the fact that it is one of the busiest interchanges in the city. Another is located at Mariaplan in the inner suburb of Majorna. The trams makes a right turn, giving the roundabout an odd design. In Warsaw, trams typically cross straight through roundabouts, and have junctions in the center of them. In Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, trams pass through the Powsta≈Ñc√≥w ≈ölƒÖskich Roundabout, stopping in the roundabout (north-headed track). The Silesian tram network in Poland has two tram roundabouts. In the city centre of Katowice, the tram line passes through the center of the Ziƒôtka Roundabout in a north‚Äìsouth alignment, with a tram stop in the center of the circle. In Bƒôdzin, unusually, the tram junction itself forms a circular roundabout, with trams going around the circle; there are tram stops immediately outside the roundabout on each branch. In V√≠tƒõzn√© n√°mƒõst√≠ (Victory Square) in Prague, Czech Republic, a tramway crosses the carriage way of the roundabout at three places. Entering as well as leaving trams give way to vehicles. In the years 1932‚Äì42 trams circulated much like vehicles.V√≠tƒõzn√© n√°mƒõst√≠, Prague trams fun web In Kiev, Ukraine an interchange of two \\"fast tram\\" lines is below a roundabout. Oslo, Norway also has many roundabouts with tram tracks passing through; for example at Bislett, Frogner plass, Sinsen, Solli plass, Carl Berners plass and Storo. In Wolverhampton, England, the West Midlands Metro tram passes through the centre of a roundabout on approach to its terminus at St Georges. This also happens in New Addington on the Tramlink north of King Henry's Drive tram stop on Old Lodge Lane at the junction to King Henry's Drive. In Sheffield, England the Sheffield Supertram systems crosses two major roundabouts. At the Brook Hill roundabout near Sheffield University, the tramway passes underneath the roundabout in a subway, while at Park Square in the city centre it travels above the roundabout on bridges and viaducts with a junction in the central island. A roundabout in southern Zagreb, Croatia features tram tracks passing through, curving at a 90¬∞ angle, as well as a full tram mini-roundabout inside the middle road island. In Croatia, where tram tracks enter the road without traffic lights, trams have the highest right of way and other non-emergency vehicles are required to yield. In Salt Lake City, Utah a light rail line on the south side of the University of Utah crosses a roundabout where Guardsman Way meets South Campus Drive. Like virtually all rail crossings in the United States, both crossings in the circle are equipped with boom barriers. In Kassel, Germany, Lines 4 and 8 pass through the center of the roundabout at Platz der Deutschen Einheit. The tram stops are in the center of the roundabout. Roundabout traffic is controlled by traffic lights. Pedestrian access is via subway and street level crossings at the lights. In Bremen, Germany, tram lines 8 and 6 pass through the center of the roundabout \\"Am Stern\\" east of the main railway station. They enter from the west and exit in a northeastern direction thus making a slight bend within the roundabout. Both stations are situated on the north-eastern edge of the roundabout. Traffic is controlled by two-colour traffic lights inside the roundabout.  Railways  In Jensen Beach, Florida, the main line of the Florida East Coast Railway running north‚Äìsouth bisects the two-lane roundabout at the junction of Jensen Beach Boulevard running east‚Äìwest. It hosts three other roads and the service entrance to a large shopping plaza. Boom barriers line the railway crossings. The landscaped central island bisected by the tracks was originally curbed/kerbed, but 18-wheelers had trouble negotiating the roundabout, so the curbs were replaced with painted concrete strips. The roundabout was built in the early 2000s and improved traffic flow, although long freight trains often cause delays. Two roundabouts in the Melbourne metropolitan area, Highett, Victoria and Brighton, have heavy rail crossing the roundabout and through the inner circle. Boom barriers protect the railway from oncoming traffic at the appropriate points in the roundabout. At the Driescher KreiselDer Driescher Kreisel in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, a railway serving a nearby paper factory crosses a roundabout located next to a shopping centre and pedestrian zone. The flow of traffic and pedestrians is governed by 14 barriers, 22 traffic lights and 8 loudspeakers. The barriers close three times daily for 7 minutes to allow trains to pass. In New Zealand's South Island, two roundabouts join major roads where a railway cuts through. One is at the intersection between State Highway 1 (as Sinclair Street and Main Street from the east) and Main Street (from the west), Park Terrace and Redwood Street in the city of Blenheim. Here the Main North Line bisects the roundabout and separates Park Terrace and Main Street eastbound from the rest of the roundabout. The other roundabout is located at Kumara Junction on the West Coast, where the Hokitika Branch separates southbound from SH 6 northbound and SH 73. Both roundabouts are controlled by flashing red lights, with additional boom barriers at the Blenheim roundabout.  Through roundabout  Also known as a hamburger roundabout, these junctions are signalised and have a straight-through section of carriageway for one of the major routes. The hamburger name derives from the fact that the plan view resembles the cross- section through a hamburger. The United Kingdom has examples on the A580 East Lancashire Road in St Helens, on Haydock Island in Merseyside (which also features the M6 passing overhead), and on the Astley/Boothstown border. More examples are the A6003 at Kettering, the A538 near Manchester Airport, the \\"Showcase\\" junction on A329 at Winnersh, Berkshire and the A63/A1079 Mytongate junction in Hull. Examples also exist in Bracknell, Hull, Bramcote in Nottinghamshire and Reading, as well as on the N2/M50 intersection in Dublin, Ireland. In Perth, Western Australia, one is found at the intersection of The Strand, Morley and Alexander Drives. Throughabouts are very common in Spain, where they are called raquetas (Spanish for racket\\") or glorieta/rotonda partida (\\"split roundabout\\"). A more advanced and safer version of a hamburger roundabout is a grade-separated interchange, separating the straight roadway and using underpasses or overpasses to cross the roundabout itself.

The same features that make roundabouts attractive for roadway junctions led to their use at junctions of multi-use trails. The University of California, Davis and Stanford University, as well as the Cape Cod and Old Colony rail trails have bicycle-pedestrian roundabouts. Roundabouts are used on off-road bicycle trails in Florida, Colorado, Alaska, and Wisconsin.Shaw, Jeffrey and Moler, Steve, Bicyclist- and Pedestrian-Only Roundabouts, Public Roads magazine, January/February 2009 An elevated roundabout is located in Eindhoven, serving pedestrian and bicycle traffic only, above the main conventional roadway intersection. It is known as the Hovenring.  In popular culture  * An old traffic circle was featured in the 2013 film The World's End.

Acridines are substituted derivatives of the parent ring. It is a planar molecule that is structurally related to anthracene with one of the central CH groups replaced by nitrogen. Like the related molecules pyridine and quinoline, acridine is mildly basic. It is an almost colorless solid, which crystallizes in needles. There are few commercial applications of acridines, at one time acridine dyes were popular but they are now relegated to niche applications, such as with acridine orange. The name is a reference to the acrid odour and acrid skin-irritating effect of the compound.  Isolation and syntheses  Carl Gr√§be and Heinrich Caro first isolated acridine in 1870 from coal tar. Acridine is separated from coal tar by extracting with dilute sulfuric acid. Addition of potassium dichromate to this solution precipitates acridine bichromate. The bichromate is decomposed using ammonia. Acridine and its derivatives can be prepared by many synthetic processes. In the Bernthsen acridine synthesis, diphenylamine is condensed with carboxylic acids in the presence of zinc chloride. When formic acid is the carboxylic acid, the reaction yields the parent acridine. With the higher larger carboxylic acids, the derivatives substituted at the meso carbon atom are generated. :The Bernthsen acridine synthesis Other older methods for the organic synthesis of acridines include condensing diphenylamine with chloroform in the presence of aluminium chloride, by passing the vapours of orthoaminodiphenylmethane over heated litharge, by heating salicylaldehyde with aniline and zinc chloride or by distilling acridone (9-position a carbonyl group) over zinc dust. Another classic method for the synthesis of acridones is the Lehmstedt-Tanasescu reaction. In enzymology, an acridone synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :3 malonyl-CoA + N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA \\\\rightleftharpoons 4 CoA + 1,3-dihydroxy-N- methylacridone + 3 CO2 Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA, whereas its 3 products are CoA, 1,3-dihydroxy-N- methylacridone, and CO2.  Reactions Acridine displays the reactions expected of an unsaturated N-heterocycle. It undergoes N-alkylation with alkyl iodides to form alkyl acridinium iodides, which are readily transformed by the action of alkaline potassium ferricyanide to N-alkyl acridones.  Basicity  Acridine and its homologues are weakly basic. Acridine is a photobase which has a ground state pKa of 5.1, similar to that of pyridine, and an excited state pKa of 10.6.Joseph R. Lakowicz. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy 3rd edition. Springer (2006). . Chapter 7. page 260. It also shares properties with quinoline. Reduction and oxidation Acridines can be reduced to the 9,10-dihydroacridines, sometimes called leuco acridines. Reaction with potassium cyanide gives the 9-cyano-9,10-dehydro derivative. On oxidation with potassium permanganate, it yields acridinic acid (C9H5N(CO2H)2) otherwise known as quinoline-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. Acridine is easily oxidized by peroxymonosulfuric acid to the acridine amine oxide. The carbon 9-position of acridine is activated for addition reactions.G. Collin, H. H√∂ke,\\"Acridine\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2012, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. Applications Several dyes and drugs feature the acridine skeleton.Denny, W. A., \\"Acridine derivatives as chemotherapeutic agents\\", Curr. Med. Chem. 2002, volume 9, 1655. Many acridines, such as proflavine, also have antiseptic properties. Acridine and related derivatives (such as amsacrine) bind to DNA and RNA due to their abilities to intercalate. Acridine orange (3,6-dimethylaminoacridine) is a nucleic acid-selective metachromatic stain useful for cell cycle determination. Dyes At one time acridine dyes were commercially significant, but they are now uncommon because they are not lightfast. Acridine dyes are prepared by condensation of 1,3-diaminobenzene derivatives. Illustrative is the reaction of 2,4-diaminotoluene with acetaldehyde:Thomas Gessner and Udo Mayer \\"Triarylmethane and Diarylmethane Dyes\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Synthesis of C.I. Basic Yellow 9, an acridine dye. 9-Phenylacridine is the parent base of chrysaniline or 3,6-diamino-9-phenylacridine, which is the chief constituent of the dyestuff phosphine (not to be confused with phosphine gas), a by-product in the manufacture of rosaniline. Chrysaniline forms red-coloured salts, which dye silk and wool in a fine yellow; and the solutions of the salts are characterized by their fine yellowish-green fluorescence. Chrysaniline was synthesized by O. Fischer and G. Koerner by condensing ortho-nitrobenzaldehyde with aniline, the resulting ortho-nitro-para-diamino-triphenylmethane being reduced to the corresponding orthoamino compound, which on oxidation yields chrysaniline. Benzoflavin, an isomer of chrysaniline, is also a dye-stuff, and has been prepared by K. Oehler from meta-phenylenediamine and benzaldehyde. These substances condense to form tetra-aminotriphenylmethane, which, on heating with acids, loses ammonia and yields 3,6-diamino-9,10-dihydrophenylacridine, from which benzoflavin is obtained by oxidation. It is a yellow powder, soluble in hot water. Safety Acridine is a skin irritant. Its LD50 (rats, oral) is 2000 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg (mice, oral).

His short reign occurred during a period of partisan strife in the Catholic Church, amid the violence and disorder in central Italy. His pontificate ended when he was deposed and confined to a monastery.  Family and early career  Little is known of Romanus's background. He was born in Gallese, near Civita Castellana. His father was called Constantine. According to Anura Gurug√©, Romanus was supposedly the nephew of Pope Marinus I, who had also come from Gallese. Romanus was installed as the cardinal priest of San Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, in 867. Papacy Scs. Petrus\\" and his monogram on the reverse In January 897, Pope Stephen VI held what is known as the Cadaver Synod. He had the body of Pope Formosus, the rival of his ally, Lambert of Spoleto, exhumed and tried for \\"perjury, violating the canons prohibiting the translation of bishops, and coveting the papacy.\\" After finding him guilty, the synod annulled all of Formosus' acts and ordinations. Formosus' body was reburied in a common grave, and then thrown in the river Tiber. Supporters of Formosus rebelled, and seven months after the synod, Stephen VI was deposed, and died soon after in prison. Romanus was elected to succeed Stephen VI in August 897. He was generally considered to be pro-Formosan, and annulled all the acts and decrees of his predecessor. This was criticised by the 15th-century historian Bartolomeo Platina, who wrote that \\"these popelings studied nothing else but to extinguish the memory and honour of their predecessors\\". During his short pontificate, he granted the pallium to Abbot Vitalis of Farfa, appointed him as the patriarch of Grado, and bestowed a privilege upon the See of Grado. Romanus also confirmed the possessions of the bishops of Girona and Elna of their sees. His short rule was regarded as a virtuous one by contemporary historian Flodoard.  Death and aftermath  Romanus' reign as pope ended in November 897, when it is said that \\"he was made a monk\\", a term used when a pope is deposed and often confined to a monastery. It is unknown whether he was deposed by supporters of his predecessor, Stephen VI, or by pro-Formosan supporters, who wanted to replace him with a pope who would more actively vindicate Formosus. Romanus' date of death is unknown. The power struggle between supporters of Formosus and those of Stephen continued for over ten years; Romanus was succeeded by Theodore II, who was only pope for twenty days, during which time he had Formosus' body reburied, and held a synod annulling the Cadaver Synod. This was reaffirmed by John IX who held synods reaffirming that of Theodore II, and he further banned the trial of people after their death. In turn, Sergius III later annulled the synods of Theodore II and John IX, and reinstated the validity of the Cadaver Synod.

They consist of a wooden board (often fitted with a resonator) with attached staggered metal tines, played by holding the instrument in the hands and plucking the tines with the thumbs (at minimum), the right forefinger (most mbira), and sometimes the left forefinger. Musicologists classify it as a lamellaphone, part of the plucked idiophone family of musical instruments. In Eastern and Southern Africa, there are many kinds of mbira, often accompanied by the hosho, a percussion instrument. It is often an important instrument played at religious ceremonies, weddings, and other social gatherings. A modern interpretation of the instrument was commercially produced and exported by ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey from the 1950s onward, popularising similar instruments outside of Africa; Tracey's design was modeled after the mbira nyunga nyunga and named 'Kalimba' after an ancient predecessor of the mbira family of instruments. Mbira became popularized largely due to the success of Thomas Mapfumo in the 1980s, who included mbira on stage accompanying modern rock instruments such as electric guitar and bass, drum kit, and horns. Mapfumo's arrangements included numerous songs directly drawn from traditional mbira repertoire. Other notable influencers bringing mbira music out of Africa are: Dumisani Maraire, who brought marimba and karimba music to the American Pacific Northwest; Ephat Mujuru, who was one of the pioneer teachers of mbira dzavadzimu in the United States; the writings and recordings of Zimbabwean musicians made by Paul Berliner. Claire Jones, a student of Dumisani Maraire in the 1970s, has been playing and teaching mbira for more than 40 years and is Festival Coordinator for Zimfest, a Zimbabwean Music Festival held annually in North America that offers many opportunities to learn and listen to mbira. Joseph H. Howard and Babatunde Olatunji have both suggested that mbira (and other metal lamellaphones) are thoroughly African, being found only in areas populated by Africans or their descendants. Similar instruments were reported to be used in Okpuje, Nsukka area of the south eastern part of Nigeria in the early 1900s. History A Zimbabwean mbira dza vadzimu Various kinds of plucked idiophones and lamellaphones have existed in Africa for thousands of years. The tines were originally made of bamboo but over the years metal keys have been developed. These types of instrument appear to have been invented twice in Africa: a wood or bamboo-tined instrument appeared on the west coast of Africa about 3,000 years ago, and metal-tined lamellophones appeared in the Zambezi River valley around 1,300 years ago.Kubik, Gerhard (1998) Kalimba ‚Äì Nsansi ‚Äì Mbira. Lamellophone in Afrika. With CD. Berlin: Museum f√ºr V√∂lkerkunde Metal-tined instruments traveled all across the continent, becoming popular among the Shona of Zimbabwe (from which the word mbira comes) and other indigenous groups in Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The mbira differentiated in its physical form and social uses as it spread. Kalimba-like instruments came to exist from the northern reaches of North Africa to the southern extent of the Kalahari Desert, and from the east coast to the west coast, though many or most groups of people in Africa did not possess mbiras. There were thousands of different tunings, different note layouts, and different instrument designs, but there is a hypothetical tuning and note layout of the original metal-tined instrument from 1,300 years ago, referred to as the 'kalimba core'.Gimenez Amoros, Luis; Tracing the Mbira Sound Archive in Zimbabwe; Routledge; Abdingdon-on-THames, Oxfordshire, England: 2018. 144 pp. Berliner, Paul F.; Soul of Mbira: Music and Traditions of the Shona People of Zimbabwe; University of California Press; Oakland, California: 1979. 280 pp. In the mid 1950s mbira instruments were the basis for the development of the kalimba, a westernized version designed and marketed by the ethnomusicologist Hugh Tracey, leading to a great expansion of its distribution outside Africa. Acoustics Lamellophones are instruments which have little tines, or \\"lamellae\\", which are played by plucking. Unlike stringed instruments or air-column instruments like flutes, the overtones of a plucked lamella are inharmonic, giving the mbira a characteristic sound. The inharmonic overtones are strongest in the attack and die out rather quickly, leaving an almost pure tone. When a tine is plucked, the adjacent tines also create secondary vibrations that increase the harmonic complexity of an individual note. Rhythm Mbira music, like much of the sub-Saharan African music traditions is based on cross-rhythm. An example from the kutsinhira part of the traditional mbira dzavadzimu piece \\"Nhema Musasa\\" is given by David Pe√±alosa, who observes that the left hand plays the ostinato \\"bass line,\\" while the right hand plays the upper melody. The composite melody is an embellishment of the 3:2 cross-rhythm (also known as a hemiola).Pe√±alosa, David (2010). The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins p. 35. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. .  Tuning  Tuning chart for the Tracey 15-note alto kalimba. mbira dzavadzimu tuning and key layout * Same color keys are the same notes (usually octaves) * Key ‚Äú1‚Äù is the lowest note, ascending to the highest note key ‚Äú23‚Äù * Key ‚Äú2‚Äù is often only found on the mavembe tuning * Some mbira have extra keys (e.g. extra ‚Äú17‚Äù on left side, or higher notes on the right beyond key ‚Äú23‚Äù are most common) * Note intervals can vary, but all the octaves are divided into a heptatonic scale, many being diatonic or at least nearly diatonic * This diagram does not represent every mbira dzavadzimu, but does represent the most common layout * It is important to note that the key numbering and color codes portrayed here are arbitrary and simply to communicate the layout (not traditional approach) It is common on African mbira and other lamellophones to have the lowest notes in the center with higher notes to the far left and the far right‚Äîthis is an ergonomic nicety, in that the thumb can pivot such that all the tines are easy to reach. However, traditional African tunings use notes that do not lie on the grid of the Western tempered scale, and traditional mbira note layouts are often idiosyncratic, sometimes with adjacent tines making part of a scale, but then an odd note thrown in that defies the pattern. Historically, mbira tunings have not mapped exactly onto Western scales; it is not unusual for a seven-note sequence on a mbira to be \\"stretched\\" over a greater range of frequencies than a Western octave and for the intervals between notes to be different from those in a Western scale. Tunings have often been idiosyncratic with variations over time and from one player to another. A mbira key produces a rich complex of overtones that varies from one instrument to another depending on its maker's intentions and accidents of fabrication, such that some instruments simply sound better when some notes of a familiar tuning are pushed. With the increased popularity of the mbira dzavadzimu in North America, Europe, and Japan in recent decades, Zimbabwean mbira makers have tended to tune their instruments more uniformly for export, but much variation is still found among mbira in their homeland. Tunings vary from family to family referring to relative interval relationships and not to absolute pitches. The most common tuning played throughout Zimbabwe and among non-Zimbabwean mbira players worldwide is Nyamaropa, similar to the western Mixolydian mode. Names may also vary between different families; Garikayi Tirikoti has developed a \\"mbira orchestra\\" that has seven different tunings, each starting on a different interval of the same seven-note scale, where it is possible to play all instruments in a single performance. The seven tunings that Garikayi uses are: Bangidza, Nyabango, Nhemamusasa, Chakwi, Taireva, Mahororo, and Mavembe (all of which are also names of traditional songs save for Mavembe and Nyabango). The closest to what is commonly named \\"Nyamaropa\\" is his \\"Nhemamusasa\\" tuning. Specific tunings Common names for tunings are: * Nyamaropa (close to Mixolydian mode) (considered the oldest and most representative in Shona culture) It emphasizes togetherness through music, creating polyrhythms through having two Mbira players at once, having singing styles accompany an Mbira such as Huro (High emotional notes that are at the top of a singer's range) & Mahon'era (a soft breathy voice at the bottom of the singer's range) or both elements. A single Mbira is considered incomplete for a performance. File:Kalimba Nyamaropa (C Mixolydian mode).ogg * Dambatsoko (close to Ionian mode), played by the Mujuru family. The name refers to their ancestral burial grounds. * Dongonda, usually a Nyamaropa tuned mbira with the right side notes the same octave as the left (an octave lower than usual). * Katsanzaira (close to Dorian mode), the highest pitch of the traditional mbira tunings. The name means \\"the gentle rain before the storm hits\\". File:Kalimba Katsanzaira.ogg * Mavembe (also: Gandanga) (close to Phrygian mode), Sekuru Gora claims to have invented this tuning at a funeral ceremony. The mourners were singing a familiar song with an unfamiliar melody and he went outside the hut and tuned his mbira to match the vocal lines. Other mbira players dispute that he invented it. File:Kalimba Mavembe (C Phrygian Mode).ogg * Nemakonde (close to Phrygian mode), same musical relationship as the mavembe, but the nemakonde tuning is a very low pitched version. File:Kalimba Nemakonde (C Phrygian Mode Low Octave).ogg * Saungweme (flattened whole tone, approaching seven tone equal temperament). File:Kalimba Saungweme.ogg Variants Mbira dzavadzimu Mbira dzavadzimu in a deze. In Shona music, the mbira dzavadzimu (\\"voice of the ancestors\\", national instrument of Zimbabwe) is a musical instrument that has been played by the Shona people of Zimbabwe for thousands of years. The mbira dzavadzimu is frequently played at religious ceremonies and social gatherings called mabira (sing. \\"bira\\"). A typical mbira dzavadzimu consists of between 22 and 28 keys constructed from hot- or cold-forged metal affixed to a hardwood soundboard (gwariva) in three different registers‚Äîtwo on the left, one on the right. While playing, the little finger of the right hand is placed through a hole in the bottom right corner of the soundboard, with the little finger entering from the front of sound board, and the ring finger and middle finger reaching around the back to stabilize the instrument. This leaves the thumb and index finger of the right hand open to stroke the keys in the right register from above (thumb) and below (index finger). The fingers of the left hand stabilize the left side of the instrument, with most fingers reaching slightly behind the instrument. Both registers on the left side of the instrument are played with the left thumb. Some mbira possess an extra key in the upper left register which is hit from below by the left index finger. Bottle caps, shells, or other objects (\\"machachara\\"Williams, B. Michael. (2001) Learning Mbira: A Beginning. Everett, PA: HoneyRock. ) are often affixed to the soundboard to create a buzzing sound when the instrument is played. In a traditional setting, this sound is considered extremely important, as it is believed to attract ancestral spirits. During a public performance, an mbira dzavadzimu is frequently placed in a deze (calabash resonator) to amplify its sound. The mbira dza vadzimu is very significant in Shona religion and culture, considered a sacred instrument by the Shona people. It is usually played to facilitate communication with ancestral spirits, bringing the spirit of the dead back on its homestead. Within the Shona tradition, the mbira may be played with paired performers in which the kushaura, the caller, leads the performed piece as the kutsinhira, the responder, \\"interlocks\\" a subsequent part. The ritual is known as the Bira. During these all-night ceremonies, people call upon the spirits to answer questions. The variations of notes in an Mbira piece aid the participants in going into trance, which in Shona culture aids the spirits in taking over the participant's body. Albert Chimedza, director of the Mbira Centre in Harare, has estimated that \\"there are at most ten thousand people in the world who play mbira.\\"  Mbira Nyunga Nyunga The nyunga nyunga which normally has 15 keys, originated from Manicaland where it traditionally played the entertainment role during social gatherings and commemorations. Jeke (Jack) Tapera introduced the mbira nyunga nyunga in the 1960s from Tete province of Mozambique to Kwanongoma College of African music (now United College of Music) in Bulawayo. Two keys were then added to make fifteen (Chirimumimba, 2007), in two rows. The mbira nyunga nyunga is similar in construction to the mbira dzavadzimu, but has no hole in the soundboard. Key pitch radiates out from the center, rather than from left to right. Zimbabwe's Dumisani Maraire originated mbira nyunga nyunga number notation. The upper row keys (from left) are keys 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 while the bottom row keys are notated as 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Maraire brought awareness of this instrument to the United States when he came to the University of Washington as a visiting artist from 1968‚Äì1972. Recently a Midlands State University (Gweru, Zimbabwe) lecturer in the department of music and musicology has suggested a letter notation; the upper keys as (from first left upper key) E, D, C, F, C, D, and E and the lower or bottom keys as (from the first lower key) A, G, F, A, F, C, D, and E. But the Maraire number notation has remained the internationally accepted system (Chirimumimba, 2007).  Njari mbira  Njani mbira has 30 to 32 keys and was also originated from Zimbabwe particularly Masvingo and Makonde.  Nhare  The nhare has 23 to 24 keys and was originated from Zimbabwe. In the Zimbabwean tradition, nhare was used for rituals of communicating with Musikavanhu or Nyadenga (God).  Mbira matepe  A Zimbabwean matepe Mbira matepe which has 26 keys originated from along the borders of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Outside Africa The Hugh Tracey kalimbas are tuned diatonically in the key of G. The arrangement of the notes on the Hugh Tracey kalimba borrows from the typical scheme with the lowest notes in the center and the upper notes on the left and the right, with the notes in the ascending scale alternating strictly right-left and going outwards towards the two sides. The diatonic western kalimba tuning which Tracey used was practical for a worldwide instrument‚Äîwith hundreds of African kalimba tunings, the chosen Western standard would maximize the number of people who would immediately connect with the kalimba. The practicality of this note arrangement, with notes going up the scale in a right-left-right-left progression, is that modal 1-3-5 or 1-3-5-7 chords are made by playing adjacent tines. If chords are played in the lower octave, the same notes will appear on the opposite side of the kalimba in the upper octave, which makes it very easy to simultaneously play a melody in the upper octave and an accompanying harmony in the lower octave. So, the arrangement of notes on the Hugh Tracey kalimba (and on virtually any kalimba that copies the instrument) makes certain complex musical operations very simple. Alternative tunings are possible, as the tines of most kalimbas are easily pushed in and out to sharpen or flatten their pitch. Some alternative tunings simply change the key of the kalimba, without changing the note layout scheme. C major is a popular tuning, sold by multiple manufacturers. Other alternative tunings move the kalimba to non-modal scales (such as Middle-Eastern scales). Each note of the kalimba can be tuned independently (unlike a guitar), so any scale, western or non-western, is possible, and traditional African scales are still accessible to this modern African instrument. Composer Georg Hajdu has tuned the Hugh Tracey alto kalimba to the chromatic steps of the Bohlen‚ÄìPierce scale in a piece called Just Her ‚Äì Jester ‚Äì Gesture. The Bohlen‚ÄìPierce scale subdivides the just twelfth into 13 steps.

Related instruments Sanza Signature Series Gravikord Instruments related to or inspired by the mbira include: * Array mbira, a modern invention consisting of as many as 150 tines configured in a special order based on the circle of fifths (see Isomorphic keyboard). * Gravikord, an electrified double harp that is a modern kora and kalimba hybrid, inspired by the cross rhythms of the mbira. The Gravikord was invented in 1986 by Bob Grawi an American musician and artist. It is also tuned in the key of G major/E minor in an extended version of the Hugh Tracey kalimba tone layout with a range of octaves. Music and playing techniques learned on this kalimba can be easily transferred and played on the Gravikord. * Guitaret, an electric lamellophone made by Hohner and invented by Ernst Zacharias, in 1963. * Ikembe, an instrument common among the Hutu of Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern DR Congo. * Modern kalimba, the mbira inspired instruments of Hugh Tracey. Named after the original kalimba (ancestor of mbira). * Kisanji among Ngala-speaking people of western DR Congo and eastern Congo Republic. * Thoom Otieno (also tom, thom or toom), popular in Gambela Region, in Western Ethiopia on the border of South Sudan. In popular culture On May 21, 2020, as part of Zimbabwe Culture Week, Google honoured the mbira with a doodle which included a button allowing users to hear and play the instrument virtually. The doodle also featured the animated story of a young girl who learns to play the mbira and inspires a new generation of mbira players after becoming an established artist as an adult.Celebrating Mbira Even though it is set in Botswana, the 1980 movie The Gods Must Be Crazy features a character playing the mbira.

They are the highest mountain range in the Carpathian Mountains. The Tatras are distinct from the Low Tatras (), a separate Slovak mountain range further south. The Tatra Mountains occupy an area of , of which about (77.7%) lie within Slovakia and about (22.3%) within Poland. The highest peak, called Gerlach, at 2,655 m (8710 ft), is located north of Poprad, entirely in Slovakia. The highest point in Poland, Rysy, at 2,499 m (8200 ft), is located south of Zakopane, on the border with Slovakia. The Tatras' length, measured from the eastern foothills of the Kobyl√≠ vrch (1109 m) to the southwestern foot of Ostr√Ω vrch (1128 m), in a straight line, is (or according to some), and strictly along the main ridge, . The range is only wide. The main ridge of the Tatras runs from the village of Huty at the western end to the village of ≈Ωdiar at the eastern end. The Tatras are protected by law by the establishment of the Tatra National Park, Slovakia and the Tatra National Park, Poland, which are jointly entered in UNESCO's World Network of Biosphere Reserves. In 1992, UNESCO jointly designated the Polish and Slovak parks a transboundary biosphere reserve in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, under its Man and the Biosphere Programme.  Etymology  The first written record of the name is from 999, when the Czech Duke Boleslaus II, on his deathbed, recalled when the Duchy of Bohemia extended to the Tritri montes. Another mention is in the 1086 document from Henry IV, wherein he referred to the Diocese of Prague with Tritri mountains. Still another is in 1125, where the Kosmas chronicles (Chronica Boemorum) mention the name Tatri. Machek in 1931 favored the theory of the Polish linguist Rozwadowski with a syllabic r like in the words chrt (Czech hound), smrt (Czech death). In Czech this syllabic is sometimes with vowels i, e or u for example ƒçrn√Ω ‚Äì ƒçern√Ω, so the Czech reconstruction from Tritri/Tritry would be Trtry. In Polish, the term Tatry is firstly mentioned in 1255. Syllabic r often has vowels on both sides in Polish, so in case of Tarty we can reconstruct the name to Tartry, where the vowel a originated before the syllabic r which dissimilated. This theory is supported by Hungarian forms of term Turtur, Turtul, Tortol from 12th to 14th centuries. It is unknown how the Slovak term looked like until the 17th century when the form Tatry is firstly mentioned and was probably taken from Polish and later found its way into Czech and Hungarian. The term Tatra also appears as a general term in Slovak for barren or stony land, and also in Little Russia for rocks and little stones in a river. Machek stresses that the name has no Slavic origin and mentions Rozwadowski's theory of an Illyrian origin because of a connection with a Herzegovian highland called Tatra, thus taken from local inhabitants. The name is also close to the Ukrainian word for gravel, toltry. Overview Mountain lakes of Czarny Staw pod Rysami and Morskie Oko seen from Poland's highest point, the north-western summit of Rysy, in elevation. The Tatras are a mountain range of a corrugated nature, originating from the Alpine orogeny, and therefore characterized by a relatively young- looking lay of the land, quite similar to the landscape of the Alps, although significantly smaller. It is the highest mountain range within the Carpathians. It consists of the internal mountain chains of: * Eastern Tatras (V√Ωchodn√© Tatry, Tatry Wschodnie), which in turn consist of:  the Belianske Tatras (Belianske Tatry, Tatry Bielskie)  and the High Tatras (Vysok√© Tatry, Tatry Wysokie) * Western Tatras (, ) The overall nature of the Tatras, together with their easy accessibility, makes them a favorite with tourists and researchers. Therefore, these mountains are a popular winter sports area, with resorts such as Poprad and the town Vysok√© Tatry (The Town of High Tatras) in Slovakia created in 1999, including former separate resorts: ≈†trbsk√© Pleso, Star√Ω Smokovec, and Tatransk√° Lomnica or Zakopane, called also \\"winter capital of Poland\\". The High Tatras, with their 24 (or 25) peaks exceeding 2,500 m above sea level, together with the Southern Carpathians, represent the only form of alpine landscape in the entire length of arc of the Carpathians. Ownership and border disputes By the end of the First Polish Republic, the border with the Kingdom of Hungary in the Tatras was not exactly defined. The Tatras became an unoccupied borderland. On 20 November 1770, under the guise of protection against the epidemic of plague in the Podolia, an Austrian army entered into Polish land and formed a cordon sanitaire, seizing SƒÖdecczyzna, Spi≈° and Podhale. Two years later, the First Partition of Poland allocated the lands to Austria. In 1824, Zakopane region and area around Morskie Oko were purchased from the authorities of the Austrian Empire by a Hungarian Emanuel Homolacs. When Austria-Hungary was formed in 1867, the Tatra Mountains have become a natural border between the two states of the dual monarchy, but the border itself still has not been exactly determined. In 1889, a Polish Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zamoyski purchased at auction the Zakopane region along with the area around Morskie Oko. Due to numerous disputes over land ownership in the late 19th century, attempts were made at the delimitation of the border. They were fruitless until 1897, and the case went to an international court which determined on 13 September 1902 the exact course of the Austro-Hungarian border in the disputed area. A new round of border disputes between Poland and Czechoslovakia started immediately after the end of the First World War, when these two countries were established. Among other claims, Poland claimed ownership of a large part of the Spi≈° region. This claim also included additional parts of the Tatra Mountains. After several years of border conflicts, the first treaty (facilitated by the League of Nations) was signed in 1925, with Poland receiving a small northernmost part of the Spi≈° region, immediately outside (to the north-east of) the Tatra Mountains, thus not changing the border in the mountains themselves. During the Second World War there were multiple attempts by both sides of the conflict to occupy more land, but the final treaty signed in 1958 (valid until present day) preserved the border line agreed in 1925.  Borders and hiking  With the collapse of the Austrian Empire in 1918 and the creation of Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Tatra Mountains started to be divided by international border. This brought considerable difficulties to hikers, as it was illegal to cross the border without passing through an official border checkpoint, and for many decades there were no checkpoints for hikers anywhere on the border ridge. The nearest road border crossings were Tatransk√° Javorina - ≈Åysa Polana and Podsp√°dy - Jurg√≥w in the east, and Such√° Hora - Chochol√≥w in the west. Indeed, those who did cross elsewhere were frequently fined or even detained by border police of both countries. On the other hand, the permeable border in the Tatra Mountains was also heavily used for cross-border smuggling of goods such as alcohol, tobacco, coffee, etc. between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Only in 1999, more than 80 years after the dissolution of the Austrian Empire, the governments of Poland and Slovakia signed an agreement designating several unstaffed border crossings (with only irregular spot checks by border police) for hikers and cyclists on the 444 km- long Slovak-Polish border. One of these border crossings was created in the Tatra Mountains themselves, on the summit of the Rysy peak. However, there were still many other peaks and passes where hiking trails ran across the border, but where crossing remained illegal. This situation finally improved in 2007, with both countries accessing the Schengen Area. Since then, it is legal to cross the border at any point (i.e. no further official checkpoints were designated). Of course, rules of the national parks on both sides of the border still apply and they restrict movement to official hiking trails and (especially on the Slovak side) mandate extensive seasonal closures in order to protect wildlife. Climate Snow covered Tatras in May 2019. The Tatras lie in the temperate zone of Central Europe. They are an important barrier to the movements of air masses. Their mountainous topography causes one of the most diverse climates in that region. Precipitation The highest precipitation figures are recorded on the northern slopes. In June and July, monthly precipitation reaches around . Precipitation occurs from 215 to 228 days a year. Thunderstorms occur 36 days a year on average. Snow cover Maximum thickness on the summit amounts to: * in Poland - Kasprowy Wierch: * in Slovakia - Lomnick√Ω ≈†t√≠t: Peaks are sometimes covered with snow or ice throughout the year. Avalanches are frequent. Temperature Extreme temperatures range from in the winter to in warmer months. Temperatures also vary depending on the altitude and sun exposure of a given slope. Temperatures below last for 192 days on the summits. Winds Visible effects of the 2004 storm in Slovakia The average wind speed on the summits is 6 m/s. *southerly winds on the northern side *westerly winds at the base of Tatra (Orava-Nowy Targ Basin) *foehn winds (Polish: halny) most often occur between October and May. They are warm and dry and can cause extensive damage. *Maximum wind speed (6 May 1968). On 19 November 2004, large parts of the forests in the southern Slovak part of the High Tatras were damaged by a strong wind storm. Three million cubic metres of trees were uprooted, two people died, and several villages were totally cut off. Further damage was done by a subsequent forest fire, and it will take many years until the local ecology is fully recovered. Flora Gentiana punctata The Tatra Mountains have a diverse variety of plant life. They are home to more than 1,000 species of vascular plants, about 450 mosses, 200 liverworts, 700 lichens, 900 fungi, and 70 slime moulds. There are five climatic-vegetation belts in the Tatras. The distribution of plants depends on altitude: *up to 1,300 m: Carpathian beech forest; almost no shrub layer, herbaceous layer occupies most of the forest floor *to 1,550 m: Spruce forest; shrub layer poorly developed, mosses are a major component *to 1,800 m: Mountain Pine, numerous herbs *to 2,300 m: high altitude grasslands *from 2,300 m up: Subnivean - bare rock and almost no vegetation (mostly lichens) Fauna Tatra chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra tatrica) The Tatra Mountains are home to many species of animals: 54 tardigrades, 22 turbellarians, 100 rotifers, 22 copepods, 162 spiders, 81 molluscs, 43 mammals, 200 birds, 7 amphibians and 2 reptiles. The most notable mammals are the Tatra chamois, marmot, snow vole, brown bear, wolf, Eurasian lynx, red deer, roe deer, and wild boar. Notable fish include the brown trout and alpine bullhead. The endemic arthropod species include a caddis fly, spider Xysticus alpicola and a springtail.

In 1683, an anonymous author published a book of adventures and excursions in the Tatras. It became very popular in Europe and contributed to the growth of tourism in the Tatras. As it later turned out, its author was Daniel Speer, born in Wroc≈Çaw, who for a time lived in the sub-Tatra region. The most famous tourist destination in Poland is Zakopane, but the developed tourist base also includes Ko≈õcielisko, Poronin, Bia≈Çy Dunajec, Bukowina Tatrza≈Ñska, Bia≈Çka Tatrza≈Ñska, Murzasichle, Ma≈Çe Ciche, ZƒÖb, Jurg√≥w, Brzegi. In Slovakia, the most important tourist base is the city Vysok√© Tatry, consisting of three parts: ≈†trbsk√© Pleso, Star√Ω Smokovec and Tatransk√° Lomnica. The Polish \\"national mountain\\" (featured prominently in myths and folklore) is Giewont, while the Slovak one is Kriv√°≈à. Trails Crowded Rysy peak Orla Perƒá is considered the most difficult and dangerous mountain trail in the entire Tatras, a suitable destination only for experienced tourists and climbers. It lies exclusively within the Polish part of the Tatras, was conceived in 1901 by Franciszek Nowicki, a Polish poet and mountain guide, and was built between 1903-1906. Over 100 individuals have lost their lives on the route since it was first established. The path is marked with red signs. The tragic death of Polish philosopher Bronis≈Çaw Bandrowski is often used by guides as a cautionary tale for tourists. He committed suicide after he was trapped for days on a rocky ledge in one of the trails near Zakopane.Bro≈ºek, Anna; Chybi≈Ñska, Alicja; Jadacki, Jacek; Wole≈Ñski, Jan (2015). Tradition of the Lvov-Warsaw School: Ideas and Continuations. Leiden: BRILL. pp. 265, 271. . The highest point in the Tatra Mountains that can be freely accessed by a labeled trail is Rysy. Most of the peaks in the Western Tatras (on both sides of the border), including the main ridge are freely accessible by hiking trails. In the Slovak part of the Eastern Tatras, only seven peaks (out of 48 with prominence of at least 100 m) are accessible by hiking trails (Rysy, Svinica/≈öwinica, Slavkovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t, Kriv√°≈à, K√¥provsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t, V√Ωchodn√° Vysok√°, and Jah≈àac√≠ ≈°t√≠t). Two of these (Rysy and Svinica/≈öwinica) are located on the border with Poland and accessible from the Polish side. The rest of the peaks on the Slovak side (including the highest one - Gerlachovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t) can only be accessed when accompanied by a certified mountain guide. UIAA members can climb them without a certified guide, but not using the normal (easiest) routes (from the III degree of difficulty). In the Slovak part most of the hiking trails in the Tatras are closed from 1 November to 15 June. Only trails from settlements up to the mountain huts are open. In Poland, the trails are open year-round. Human engagement In the 18th and 19th centuries, the mountains were used for sheep grazing and mining. Many trees were cut down to make way for humans. Although these activities were stopped, the impact is still visible. Moreover, pollution from the industrialized regions of Krak√≥w in Poland or Ostrava in Czech Republic, as well as casual tourism, cause substantial damage. Volunteers however initiate litter removal events frequently, on both sides of the border. The Slovak Tatra National Park (Tatransk√Ω n√°rodn√Ω park; TANAP) was founded in 1949 (), and the contiguous Polish Tatra National Park (Tatrza≈Ñski Park Narodowy) in 1954 (). The two parks were added jointly to the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve list in 1993. In 2013, the International Union for Conservation of Nature threatened to cancel the Slovak TANAP's status of a national park because of the large investments (mainly in skiing infrastructure) in the park, which seriously interfere with the landscape and nature. In popular culture The 1999 film Ravenous was filmed in the Tatra Mountains. *In 2006, the Bollywood film Fanaa, portraying places in Kashmir, was filmed at Zakopane, mainly because of the risks associated with insurgency in Kashmir, as well due to some similarities in a mountain landscape. * Leo Frankowski mentions the Tatras several times in his science fiction novels in the Conrad Stargard series.

He had adopted the name Mauro upon entering the religious order of the Camaldolese. Strongly conservative and traditionalist, he opposed democratic and modernising reforms in the Papal States and throughout Europe, seeing them as fronts for revolutionary leftism. Against these trends, Gregory XVI sought to strengthen the religious and political authority of the papacy (see ultramontanism). In the encyclical Mirari vos, he pronounced it \\"false and absurd, or rather mad, that we must secure and guarantee to each one liberty of conscience.\\" He encouraged missionary activity abroad and condemned the slave trade. However, his harsh repression, financial extravagance and neglectfulness left him deeply unpopular domestically. He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name \\"Gregory\\", and the most recent non-bishop to become pope. He was, until the accession of Pope Francis in 2013, the most recent pope to have been a priest of a religious order. Biography Early life Bartolomeo Alberto Cappellari was born at Belluno in the Republic of Venice, on 18 September 1765, to an Italian lower noble family. His parents were from a small village named Pesariis, in Friuli. His father was a lawyer. At the age of eighteen Bartolomeo Cappellari joined the order of the Camaldolese (part of the Benedictine monastic family) and entered the Monastery of San Michele in Murano, near Venice. He was ordained a priest in 1787.Toke, Leslie. \\"Pope Gregory XVI\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 November 2015 As a Camaldolese monk, Cappellari rapidly gained distinction for his theological and linguistic skills, and was assigned to teach philosophy and theology at San Michele in 1787, at the age of 22. In 1790, at the age of 25, he was appointed censor librorum for his Order, as well as for the Holy Office at Venice. He went to Rome in 1795 and in 1799 published a polemic against the Italian Jansenists titled II Trionfo della Santa Sede (\\"The Triumph of the Holy See\\"), which passed through various editions in Italy and was translated into several European languages. In 1800 he became a member of the Academy of the Catholic Religion, founded by Pope Pius VII (1800‚Äì1823), to which he contributed memoirs on theological and philosophical questions. In 1805, at the age of 40, he was appointed abbot of the Monastery of San Gregorio on Rome's Caelian Hill. When the army of the French Emperor Napoleon took Rome and arrested and deported Pius VII to France in 1809, Cappellari fled to Murano, where he taught in the Monastery of St. Michele of his Order, where he had first become a monk. From there he and a group of monks moved their little college to Padua in 1814. After Napoleon's final defeat, the Congress of Vienna re-established the sovereignty of the Papal States over central Italy and Cappellari was called back to Rome to assume the post of vicar general of the Camaldolese Order. He was then appointed as Counsellor to the Inquisition, and later promoted to be Consultor (29 February 1820) and then, on 1 October 1826, Prefect of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide (\\"Propagation of the Faith\\"), which dealt with all missionary work outside of the Spanish Empire, including missions to the non-Catholic states in Europe.Salvador Miranda, \\"Biographical notes on Mauro Cappellari\\". Retrieved 10 May 2016. Twice he was offered a bishopric and twice he refused. Cardinal \\"The Grand Gala Berlin\\" is a luxury carriage constructed in Rome during the first half of the nineteenth century. It is the work of two pontiffs: Leo XII, who called for it to be produced in the years 1824‚Äì1826, and Gregory XVI, who requested some important modifications. On 21 March 1825, Cappellari was created cardinal in pectore (published 13 March 1826) by Pope Leo XII, and shortly afterwards he was asked to negotiate a concordat to safeguard the rights of Catholics in the Low Countries, a diplomatic task which he completed successfully. He also negotiated a peace on behalf of Armenian Catholics with the Ottoman Empire. He publicly condemned the Polish revolutionaries, who he thought were seeking to undermine Russian Tsar Nicholas I's efforts to support the Catholic royalist cause in France by forcing him to divert his troops to suppress the uprising in Poland. Cappellari had never travelled outside Italy and was most familiar with Venice and Rome. He spoke Italian and Latin fluently, but no other European languages, and did not understand European politics. However, he was proficient in Armenian, and Haruti'iwn Awgerian (Pascal Aucher)'s 1827 Venice edition of works attributed to Severian of Gabala and translated into Armenian was dedicated to him. Pontificate Papal election Pope Gregory XVI, 1834 On 2 February 1831, after a fifty-day conclave, Cappellari was unexpectedly chosen to succeed Pope Pius VIII (1829‚Äì30). His election was influenced by the fact that the cardinal considered the most papabile, Giacomo Giustiniani, was vetoed by King Ferdinand VII of Spain. There then arose a deadlock between the other two major candidates, Emmanuele De Gregorio and Bartolomeo Pacca. What finally drove them to make a decision was a message from the Duke of Parma notifying them that revolt was about to break out in the northern Papal States. To resolve the impasse, the cardinals turned to Cappellari, but it took eighty-three ballots for the canonically required two- thirds majority to be reached.J. P. Adams, Sede Vacante 1830‚Äì1831.. Retrieved 10 May 2016. At the time of election, Cardinal Cappellari was not yet a bishop: he is the most recent man to be elected pope prior to his episcopal consecration. He was consecrated as bishop by Bartolomeo Pacca, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri and dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, with Pietro Francesco Galleffi, Cardinal Bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina and sub- dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, and Tommasso Arezzo, Cardinal Bishop of Sabina, acting as co-consecrators. The choice of Gregory XVI as his regnal name was influenced by the fact that he had been abbot of the Monastery of San Gregorio on the Coelian Hill for more than twenty years, and in honour of Gregory XV, the founder of the Congregation for the Propaganda (Propagation of the Faith). The Monastery of S. Gregorio was the same abbey from which Pope Gregory I had dispatched missionaries to England in 596. Actions The revolution of 1830, which overthrew the House of Bourbon, had just inflicted a severe blow on the Catholic royalist party in France. Almost the first act of the new French government was to seize Ancona, thus throwing Italy, and particularly the Papal States, into a state of confusion and political upheaval. In the course of the struggle that ensued, it was more than once necessary to call in Austrian troops to fight the red-shirted republicans engaged in a guerrilla campaign. The conservative administration of the Papal States postponed their promised reforms after a series of bombings and assassination attempts. The replacement of Tommaso Bernetti by Luigi Lambruschini as Cardinal Secretary of State in 1836 did nothing to appease the situation. In the northern territories the leaders of the revolt were middle- class gentry opposed to the general inefficiency of the government. Governance of the papal states Gregory XVI and Cardinal Lambruschini opposed basic technological innovations such as gas lighting and railways, believing that they would promote commerce and increase the power of the bourgeoisie, leading to demands for liberal reforms which would undermine the monarchical power of the Pope over central Italy. Gregory XVI in fact banned railways in the Papal States, calling them chemins d'enfer (\\"road to hell\\", a play on the French for railroad, chemin de fer, literally \\"iron road\\"). The insurrections at Viterbo in 1836, in various parts of the Legations in 1840, at Ravenna in 1843 and at Rimini in 1845, were followed by wholesale executions and draconian sentences of hard labour and exile, but they did not bring the unrest within the Papal States under the control of the authorities. Gregory XVI made great expenditures for defensive, architectural and engineering works, having a monument to Pope Leo XII built by Giuseppe Fabris in 1837. He also lavished patronage on such scholars as Angelo Mai, Giuseppe Mezzofanti, and Gaetano Moroni. This largesse, however, significantly weakened the finances of the Papal States. Condemnation of the slave trade Monument to Gregory XVI in Saint Peter's Basilica In 1839, Gregory XVI issued an apostolic letter against the Atlantic slave trade, In supremo apostolatus, in which he wrote: Other activities =Encyclicals= Other important encyclicals issued by Pope Gregory XVI were Sollicitudo ecclesiarum, which stated that in the event of a change of government, the church would negotiate with the new government for placement of bishops and vacant dioceses (issued 1831); Mirari Vos, on liberalism and religious indifferentism (issued on 15 August 1832); Quo graviora, on the Pragmatic Constitution in the Rhineland (issued on 4 October 1833); Singulari Nos, on the ideas of Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais (issued on 25 June 1834), and Commissum divinitus (17 May 1835) on church and state.Pope Gregory XVI. Commissum divinitus, May 17, 1835, Papal Encyclicals Online =Canonizations and beatifications= Gregory XVI canonized Veronica Giuliani, an Italian mystic, during his papacy. During his reign, five saints were canonized (notably Alphonsus Liguori) and thirty-three Servants of God were declared Blessed (including the Augustinian Simon of Cascia). In addition, many new religious orders were founded or supported and the devotion of the faithful to the Blessed Virgin Mary increased, both in private and public life. =Consistories= The pope created 75 cardinals in 24 consistories in which the pope elevated 35 cardinals in pectore including his future successor Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti, who became Pope Pius IX. The pope also created six additional cardinals in pectore though the pope died before these names could be revealed therefore cancelling their appointments to the cardinalate. Death and burial On 20 May 1846, he felt himself failing in health. A few days later, he was taken ill with facial erysipelas. At first the attack was not thought to be very serious, but on 31 May, his strength suddenly failed, and it was seen that the end was near. Gregory XVI died on 1 June 1846 at 9:15 AM at age 80. After his funeral, he was buried in Saint Peter's Basilica.Catholic Encyclopedia See also * Cardinals created by Gregory XVI * List of encyclicals of Pope Gregory XVI * 1832 Rothschild loan to the Holy See * Ludovico Morbioli *List of popes References Sources * (critical)  (laudatory)  * Regoli, Roberto, \\"Gregorio XVI: una ricerca historiografica,\\" Archivum Historiae Pontificiae 44 (2006), pp. 141‚Äì171.

University of Maiduguri, Borno, Nigeria but \\"the 2007 (satellite) image shows significant improvement over previous years.\\" Lake Chad is economically important, providing water to more than 30 million people living in the four countries surrounding it (Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria) on the central part of the Sahel. It is the largest lake in the Chad Basin. Geography and hydrology The freshwater lake is located in the Sahelian zone of West- central Africa. It is located in the interior basin which used to be occupied by a much larger ancient sea sometimes called Mega Chad. The lake is historically ranked as one of the largest lakes in Africa. Its surface area varies by season as well as from year to year. Lake Chad is mainly in the far west of Chad, bordering on northeastern Nigeria. The Chari River, fed by its tributary the Logone, provides over 90% of the lake's water, with a small amount coming from the Yobe River in Nigeria/Niger. Despite high levels of evaporation, the lake is fresh water. Over half of the lake's area is taken up by its many small islands (including the Bogomerom Archipelago), reedbeds and mud banks, and a belt of swampland across the middle divides the northern and southern halves. The shorelines are largely composed of marshes. The Lake Chad flooded savannas surround the lake, including permanently and seasonally- flooded grasslands, savannas, and woodlands. Because Lake Chad is very shallow‚Äîonly at its deepest‚Äîits area is particularly sensitive to small changes in average depth, and consequently it also shows seasonal fluctuations in size. Lake Chad has the Bahr el-Ghazal (wadi in Chad) outlet, but its waters percolate into the Soro and Bod√©l√© depressions. The climate is dry most of the year, with moderate rainfall from June through September. History Maximum extension of the Holocene \\"Lake Mega-Chad\\" Lake Chad in a 2001 satellite image, with the actual lake in blue, and vegetation on top of the old lake bed in green. Above that, the changes from 1973 to 1997 are shown. The same changes marked more clearly on another map Lake Chad gave its name to the country of Chad. The name Chad is derived from the Kanuri word \\"S√°d«ù\\" meaning \\"large expanse of water\\". The lake is the remnant of a former inland sea, paleolake Mega-Chad, which existed during the African humid period. At its largest, sometime before 5000 BC, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of , larger than the Caspian Sea is today, and may have extended as far northeast as within of Faya-Largeau. At its largest extent the river Mayo K√©bbi represented the outlet of the paleolake Mega-Chad, connecting it to the Niger River and the Atlantic.Leblanc et al. (2006). \\"Reconstruction of megalake Chad using shuttle radar topographic mission data\\". Palaeogeography, palaeoclimatology, palaeoecology 239, pp. 16‚Äì27 1872-616X This lowest point on the basin's rim now stands at about 320 meters above sea level, meaning that even if Lake Chad were to refill to its largest extent it would still be at the most only about 50 meters deep. The presence of African manatees in the inflows of Lake Chad is an evidence of the overflow history, since the manatee is otherwise only in rivers connected to the Atlantic Ocean (i.e. it is not possible that it evolved separately in an enclosed Chad Basin).The grand scale of the Mayo K√©bbi river course is also evidence of earlier overflow from Mega-Chad; the upstream catchment of today is far too small to have dug such a large channel. Romans reached the lake in the first century of their empire. During the time of Augustus Lake Chad was still a huge lake and two Roman expeditions were performed in order to reach it: Septimius Flaccus and Julius Maternus reached the \\"lake of hippopotamus (as the lake was called by Claudius Ptolemaeus). They moved from coastal Tripolitania and passed near the Tibesti mountains. Both expeditions passed through the territory of the Garamantes, and were able to leave a small garrison on the \\"lake of hippopotamus and rhinoceros\\" after three months of travel in desert lands. Lake Chad was first surveyed from shore by Europeans in 1823, and it was considered to be one of the largest lakes in the world then. In 1851, a party including the German explorer Heinrich Barth carried a boat overland from Tripoli across the Sahara Desert by camel and made the first European waterborne survey. British expedition leader James Richardson died just days before reaching the lake. In Winston Churchill's book The River War: An Account of the Reconquest of the Sudan, published in 1899, he specifically mentions the shrinking of Lake Chad. He writes: > Altogether France has enough to occupy her in Central Africa for some time > to come: and even when the long task is finished, the conquered regions are > not likely to be of great value. They include the desert of the Great Sahara > and wide expanses of equally profitless scrub or marsh. Only one important > river, the Shari, flows through them, and never reaches the sea: and even > Lake Chad, into which the Shari flows, appears to be leaking through some > subterranean exit, and is rapidly changing from a lake into an immense > swamp. Lake Chad has shrunk considerably since the 1960s, when its shoreline had an elevation of about above sea level and it had an area of more than , making its surface the fourth largest in Africa. An increased demand on the lake's water from the local population has likely accelerated its shrinkage over the past 40 years. Kanuri tribal fishermen in 1970s The size of Lake Chad greatly varies seasonally with the flooding of the wetlands areas. In 1983, Lake Chad was reported to have covered , had a maximum depth of 11 metres (36 ft), and a volume of . By 2000, its extent had fallen to less than . A 2001 study published in the Journal of Geophysical Research blamed the lake's retreat largely on overgrazing in the area surrounding the lake, causing desertification and a decline in vegetation. The United Nations Environment Programme and the Lake Chad Basin Commission concur that at least half of the lake's decrease is attributable to shifting climate patterns. UNEP blames human water use, such as inefficient damming and irrigation methods, for the rest of the shrinkage. As late as December 2014, Lake Chad was still sufficient in size and volume such that boats could capsize or sink. The European Space Agency has recently presented data showing an actual increase in lake extent of Lake Chad between the years of 1985 to 2011.http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2013/10/lake_chad_water_extent_increase/13371177-1-eng- GB/Lake_Chad_water_extent_increase.gif A map of the lake in 1973 Lake Chad in 1930, aerial photograph by Walter Mittelholzer Referring to the floodplain as a lake may be misleading, as less than half of Lake Chad is covered by water through an entire year. The remaining sections are considered as wetlands. Lake Chad's volume of is very small relative to that of Lake Tanganyika (), and Lake Victoria (), African lakes with similar surface areas. Flora The lake is home to more than 44 species of algae. In particular it is one of the world's major producers of wild spirulina. The lake also has large areas of swamp and reedbeds. The floodplains on the southern lakeshore are covered in wetland grasses such as Echinochloa pyramidalis, Vetiveria nigritana, Oryza longistaminata, and Hyparrhenia rufa. Fauna The entire Lake Chad basin holds 179 fish species, of which more than half are shared with the Niger River Basin, about half are shared with the Nile River Basin, and about a quarter are shared with the Congo River Basin. Lake Chad itself holds 85 fish species. Of the 25 endemics in the basin, only Brycinus dageti is found in the lake itself, and it is perhaps better treated as a dwarf subspecies of Brycinus nurse. This relatively low species richness and virtual lack of endemic fish species contrasts strongly with other large African lakes, such as Victoria, Tanganyika and Malawi. There are many floating islands in the lake. It is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including elephants, hippopotamus, crocodile (all in decline), and large communities of migrating birds including wintering ducks, ruff (Philomachus pugnax) and other waterfowl and shore birds. There are two near-endemic birds in the region, the river prinia (Prinia fluviatilis) and the rusty lark (Mirafra rufa). The shrinking of the lake is threatening nesting sites of the black-crowned crane (Balearica pavonina pavonina). During the wet season, fish move into the mineral-rich lake to breed and find food. Carnivores such as the Central African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) and the caracal (Felis caracal) used to inhabit areas surrounding the lake. Threats and preservation There is some debate over the mechanisms causing the lake's disappearance. The leading theory, which is most often cited by the UN, is that the unsustainable usage of the lake by both governments and local communities has caused the lake to be over-used, not allowing it to replenish. Recently, however, an additional theory is gaining traction. This states that European air pollution had shifted rainfall patterns farther south, thereby making the region drier and not allowing the lake to replenish. Since the implementation of new regulations in the EU concerning air pollutants, much of this rainfall is now beginning to return, thereby explaining the small improvements observed since 2007. The only protected area is the Lake Chad Game Reserve, which covers half of the area next to the lake that belongs to Nigeria. The whole lake has been declared a Ramsar site of international importance. Speaking at the United Nations 73rd General Assembly, the President of Nigeria urged the international community to assist in combatting the root causes of conflict surrounding the Lake Chad Endorheic basin. Recent violence in the region has been attributed to competition between farmers and herders seeking irrigation for crops and watering of herds respectively. In September 2020, in order to explore oil and mining opportunities in the region, Chad's tourism and culture minister wrote to UNESCO, the body which awards the world heritage designation, asking to \\"postpone the process of registering Lake Chad on the world heritage list\\". Management The Transaqua scheme (in red) to replenish the lake Plans to divert the Ubangi River into Lake Chad were proposed in 1929 by Herman S√∂rgel in his Atlantropa project and again in the 1960s. The copious amount of water from the Ubangi would revitalize the dying Lake Chad and provide livelihood in fishing and enhanced agriculture to tens of millions of central Africans and Sahelians. Interbasin water transfer schemes were proposed in the 1980s and 1990s by Nigerian engineer J. Umolu (ZCN scheme) and Italian firm Bonifica (the Transaqua canal scheme). In 1994, the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) proposed a similar project, and at a March 2008 summit, the heads of state of the LCBC member countries committed to the diversion project. In April 2008, the LCBC advertised a request for proposals for a World Bank-funded feasibility study. Neighboring countries have agreed to commit resources to restoring the lake, notably Nigeria. The CIMA (Canada) proposed project can be used as an inland waterway, as it uses the same water flow (100 m3/s) as the Moscow Canal. Local impact The dwindling of the lake has had devastating impacts on Nigeria. Because of the way it has shrunk dramatically in recent decades, the lake has been labeled an ecological catastrophe by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Human population expansion and unsustainable human water extraction from Lake Chad have caused several natural species to be stressed and threatened by declining lake levels. For example, the decline or disappearance of the endangered painted hunting dog has been noted in the Lake Chad area. The shrinking of the lake has also caused several different conflicts to emerge, as the countries bordering Lake Chad argue over the rights to the remaining areas of water. Along with international conflicts, violence between countries is also increasing among the lake's dwellers. Farmers and herders want the water for their crops and livestock and are constantly diverting the water, while the lake's fishermen want water diversion slowed or halted in order to prevent continuing decline in water levels resulting in further strain on the lake's fish. Furthermore, populations of birds and other animals in the area are threatened, including those that serve as important sources of food for the local human population.
