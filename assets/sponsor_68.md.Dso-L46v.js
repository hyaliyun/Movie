History Tobacco farming in the Connecticut River valley has a long history. When the first settlers came to the valley in the 1630s, tobacco was already being grown by the native population. The town of Windsor is the epicenter of the tobacco industry in Connecticut. The town was founded in 1633 and within seven years it was producing tobacco for personal use and profit. The tobacco being grown was for pipe use, brought up from Virginia since the tobacco variety found in the Connecticut Valley was not as delectable as the Virginian style. It was immediately apparent that the soil from the river, a rich sandy loam, and the hot and short summer of New England yielded an excellent crop each year. Approximately of land in Connecticut is covered by Windsor Soil, named after the town of Windsor. Eventually, the popularity of cigars became greater than the pipe. Initially, a tobacco leaf type named Shoestring was grown. This was replaced by Broadleaf tobacco, which was the variety that dominated the industry. It was in such high demand that during the Civil War the Connecticut Valley yielded up to ten million pounds per year. The fame of quality Connecticut tobacco was raved about throughout the settled regions of the United States. By 1700, tobacco was being exported via the Connecticut River to European ports. The use of Connecticut Valley tobacco as a cigar wrapper leaf began in the 1820s. Area farmers grew tobacco for the two outside layers of cigars, the binder and the wrapper. By the 1830s, tobacco farmers were experimenting with different seeds and processing techniques. Knowing that they were not the only players in the cigar wrapper economy, farmers began planting a new tobacco species in 1875, the Havana Seed. This smooth, good-looking leaf yielded a higher percent of quality cigar wrappers. Just a few decades later, in the late 19th century, a fine grained leaf type imported from Sumatra was adopted for growth in Connecticut. The demand for high quality cigar wrapper was never ending. This pushed Connecticut growers and scientists to develop a leaf so smooth and golden that it would dominate the market. Farmers and scientists worked together to develop a hybrid to overcome competition from Cuba and Asia. Using over thirty samples from Cuba and Sumatra, Shade Tobacco was born in 1900, and the first shade-leaf tent was put up on River Street in Windsor. The shade tents made of cloth cut sunlight and raised humidity. The technique of growing shade tobacco has changed little in the past hundred years. To form the shade tents, a tobacco field is set with posts in a grid layout. Wires are stretched from post to post, and a light, durable fabric (once cotton but now a synthetic fiber) is tied across them and draped along the sides. For example, twenty posts in four rows of five will create twelve square cells in three rows of four. Under the tents the sunlight is soft and diffused, the air is humid, and the ambient temperature is slightly warmer than outside. Filtering the sun produces a thinner and more elastic tobacco leaf that cures to a lighter, even color often desired by the Cuban and Dominican cigar producers. The 1920 Prohibition ceased legal sales of alcohol in Connecticut, and tobacco production consequently reached a peak in Connecticut. At its height, there was greater than of tobacco being cultivated under shade in the Connecticut Valley. Currently, the amount of tobacco being grown in the valley is just over a steady . Windsor tobacco leaves are highly prized by fine cigar makers, and are used as the cigar's outer wrapping. The former president of U.S. operations for Davidoff, a Swiss maker of luxury goods including premium cigars, praised Connecticut shade tobacco as \\"[a] nice Connecticut wrapper\\" and \\"very silky, very fine. From a marketing point of view‚Äù, and ‚Äúone of the best tasting and looking wrappers available\\", in a 1992 Cigar Aficionado article on why the world's best cigars use Connecticut tobacco wrapper leaves. By 2011, plantings were down to about 700 acres a year, and by 2017 those plantings had declined about 80%. So in 2017, one of the largest producers of shade grown tobacco, O.J. Thrall, placed over 300 acres of prime tobacco growing land up for sale. Pockets of the crop remain in production in Connecticut towns such as Windsor, East Windsor, Suffield and Enfield. In popular culture The 1952 novel East of Eden by John Steinbeck is set partially on a farm in Connecticut, where character Charles Trask improves the land in part by planting tobacco. The 1958 novel and 1961 motion picture titled Parrish featured the shade tobacco industry in and around Hartford in the '40s and '50s.

This diversity not only includes that of its indigenous peoples, but also those of its regions and socioeconomic strata. It was founded in 1982 by anthropologist Guillermo Bonfil Batalla at a time when the country was accepting and promoting its cultural diversity. The museum does not have a large permanent collection but rather focuses on temporary exhibits, concerts, workshops and other cultural and educational events as well as promoting the creation of museums in Mexico to promote local cultures. The museum is also home to the Centro de Informaci√≥n y Documentaci√≥n Alberto Beltr√°n, founded in 1971 to promote research and knowledge about Mexican handcrafts and folk art and indigenous ethnicities. Description Museum decorated for Day of the Dead. The museum was established as part of the acknowledgement in the latter 20th century that Mexico consists of various ethnicities and cultures. The term ‚Äúculturas populares‚Äù (popular cultures) refers to indigenous peoples as well as those of different regions, and different socioeconomic levels. Its primary function is to document, promote and foment creative activities in the various subcultures of Mexico in both rural and urban areas through exhibitions and other activities. These activities include collections of art and other objects, photography, film, sound and documentation. The elements of these popular cultures are to be promoted as part of Mexico's national heritage. The main goal of the museum is not to form a large permanent collection but rather to stimulate the formation of museums and other institutions related to various topics. The museum is a part of the Direcci√≥n General de Culturas Populares which is a subsidiary of the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes . The museum receives about 1.1 million visitors each year, who come to see its frequent temporary exhibitions and other events. The museum site is on Avenida Hidalgo, in the historic center of the Mexico City borough of Coyoac√°n. It has five main exhibition areas: The Chapel, the Quinta Margarita, the Moctezuma Annex, the patio areas and the Guillermo Bonfil Batalla Hall. The Chapel is the main exhibition area, a building that dates to the mid 19th century. It has two floors with exhibition space, the Educal bookstore, restoration and storage facilities. On the second level there are areas for conferences and other events. The Quinta Margarita is a square covered patio space which can hold 300 people, used for conferences, workshops, shows and concerts. The Moctezuma Annex is a small building which houses the museum's educational services and host educational events. There are a number of patio areas called Jacarandas, Central and Moctezuma which are used for auditions, dances, book presentations, conferences and exhibitions. The Guillermo Bonfil Batalla Hall was built in 1981 for large scale exhibitions. Alberto Beltr√°n Center of Information and Documentation, housed by the Museum of Popular Cultures The Centro de Informaci√≥n y Documentaci√≥n Alberto Beltr√°n (Alberto Beltr√°n Information and Documentation Center) has over 152,000 titles divided into six permanent collections related to Mexico's various cultures: documents, sound library, periodical library, video library and books and is open to the public. It was originally established in 1971, predating the museum, by the Direcci√≥n General de Arte Popular and the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica along with graphic artist Alberto Beltr√°n to promote research into Mexican handcrafts and folk art along with its indigenous ethnicities. The name of Albert Beltr√°n was added in his honor in 2005. Tree of Life sculpture at the museum Other important installations on the site are the Cuezcomate, the Arbol de la Vida and the Tejedores de Suenos mural. The Cuezcomate is a Nahuatl word that means ‚Äúguard bread or grain.‚Äù It is a replica of a Mesoamerican construction made of clay and palm fronds used to store corn. The structure here is modeled on those of the state of Morelos. It was created for the museum's first major exhibition in 1982 and remains in the patio areas. The Arbol de la Vida, or Tree of Life, is a fired clay sculpture mostly associated with Metepec, State of Mexico. This five meter tall tree was created by Jos√© Alfonso Soteno Fern√°ndez in 1992 to commemorate the 500 anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the Americas. It contains allusions to indigenous culture when Columbus arrived, Spanish culture and that of African slaves brought over which have combined to create the various manifestations of Mexican culture. The Tejedores de Sue√±os‚Äù mural is a graffiti mural. The iconography is eclectic with images of nopal cactus, masked persons, robotic insects and crosses in a style which combines Mexican folk art and that of comic books. The museum offers workshops and other classes for museum professionals interested in promoted Mexico's popular cultures. It also offers guided tours which are generally associated with workshops. The museum maintains a full schedule of academic, cultural and recreational activities, including concerts, dances, conferences, seminars, workshops, videos, book and music presentations, sales of Mexican handcrafts and Mexican food. The museum has been the site of an annual Tamale Festival since 1993, with examples of tamales from all over Mexico. Most of its major events are temporary exhibits related to some aspect of Mexico's cultures. In 1997 it had an exhibition called La Ruta de la Esclavo tracing the history of African slavery in Mexico during the colonial period. For Day of the Dead 2011, the museum held an event called Tzompantli Gr√°fico where twenty artists including Fupete from Italy and Lucas Varela from Argentina, created modern skull images to arrange similar to that of a Mesoamerican tzompantli or skull-rack. For the same holiday, it held Ofrendas con la boca y el pie: lienzos llenos de tradici√≥n with Day of the Dead altars from an artists‚Äô group called Asociaci√≥n de Pintores con la Boca y con el Pie founded in 1963 who paint with their mouths or feet because of a disability. In 2012 the museum held a temporary exhibition called ‚ÄúFavores ins√≥litos. Exvoto contempor√°neo\\", which features votive paintings that have nontraditional themes such as prostitution, table dance, sexual diversity, infidelity, figures from popular culture, problems with family members and witchcraft. That same year it held an exhibition called ‚ÄúT√°pame con tu rebozo‚Äù demonstrating and selling rebozos from various parts of central and southern Mexico, dating from 1860 to 2012. It also exhibited 3,500 pieces of jewelry and other adornment in an exhibition called Las perlas de la Virgen y tus labios de coral. El adorno popular, which included Pur√©pecha silver, Huichol beads, and silverwork and jewelry from Puebla, Chiapas, Yucat√°n and Veracruz . In 2012 it had an exhibition of fine art such as painting and photography done by indigenous people, with the aim of combating the notion that such is only done by those of European heritage. It also included more traditional artwork, evaluating its artistic properties. The museum has also had major exhibitions related to the working class, fishermen, the maguey plant, Mexican coffee and Mexican folk dance. History It was inaugurated on September 24, 1982 by Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo . Its founder and first director was anthropologist Guillermo Bonfil Batalla. Its first major program was called ‚ÄúEl ma√≠z, fundamento de la cultura popular mexicana‚Äù with an exhibition at the museum site as well as posters related to the topic, a monograph competition and various publications including a cookbook. From 2005 to 2009, the site underwent two stages of renovation work, mostly on the Chapel, building, which dates from the 19th century. The work included roof sealant, drainage, tools for workshops, and expanding its museum storage and exhibition facilities.

The striker was immediately loaned out to Maidenhead United on the same day. He scored his only goal of the loan spell against Woking in a 2‚Äì0 win for \\"The Magpies\\" on 3 March 2012 before suffering an ankle injury which prevented him playing for the rest of the season. After remaining on trial with AFC Wimbledon for the duration of the pre‚Äìseason, he was rewarded with a permanent move to \\"The Dons\\" on 13 August 2012. Strutton made his football league debut for \\"The Dons\\" on 18 September 2012 as a second-half substitute for Warren Cummings in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Torquay United. Strutton scored his first goal for \\"The Dons\\" on 3 November 2012 in the First Round of the FA Cup, earning a 1‚Äì1 draw and a replay with York City.

However, Strutton suffered a fractured fibula and a slight displacement of the ankle joint during his Aldershot debut against Southport. He returned from loan immediately, with Wimbledon physio Stuart Douglas stating that it would be wrong to predict a timeframe for his return. Then he signed for Braintree Town and had loans spells at Maidenhead United, Hayes & Yeading United and Slough Town. Strutton joined Maidenhead permanently in summer 2016, but made only one appearance and returned to Chalfont on loan.

Despite a loss in the first round to a lower-rated opponent, Wang managed to get 6/9 (a result good enough to tie for third) by getting draws against GM Anton Kovalyov, IM Jean H√©bert, and IM Raja Panjwani. After defeating Candidate Master Nikita Gusev in a playoff game, Wang was awarded the IM title. At the age of 13, Wang became the second youngest player in Canadian history to become an International Master. He was only a few months older than International Grandmaster Mark Bluvshtein, the youngest Canadian player to become an IM, when he became an international master.

The composite image was printed from over 130 separate wood blocks; a total of 139 are known. Approximately long, it is one of the largest prints ever produced. It was designed to be pasted to the walls in city halls or the palaces of princes to create a decorative frieze, an expression of the Emperor's power and magnificence: a pictorial form of the contemporaneous royal entry, which like many Renaissance entries looked back to the Roman triumph. Maximilian's papers show that he intended the procession to \\"grace the walls of council chambers and great halls of the empire, proclaiming for posterity the noble aims of their erstwhile ruler\\". It was one of several works of propaganda in literary and print form commissioned by Maximilian, who was always drastically short of money, and lacked the funds to actually stage such a ceremony, unlike his Habsburg descendants. It could also be bound as a book, and it is copies treated this way which have survived, as well as those from later reprints. The work is one of three huge prints created for Maximilian. The other two projects were largely designed by Albrecht D√ºrer: a Triumphal Arch (1512-5, 192 woodcut panels, high and wide), and a Large Triumphal Carriage (1522, 8 woodcut panels, high long) which was originally intended to form part of the Triumphal Procession but was published separately by D√ºrer in 1522. These monumental projects reflect Maximilian's position as Holy Roman Emperor, and link him to the triumphal arches and triumphs of Ancient Rome. Only the Triumphal Arch was completed before Maximilian's death in 1519, and distributed as Imperial propaganda as he intended. Other projects were the verse and print books Theuerdank, an allegorical chivalrous romance account of Maximilian's courtship of Mary of Burgundy, and Der Weisskunig. The programme for the Triumphal Procession was worked out by Maximilian and Johannes Stabius in 1512, and dictated to Maximilian's secretary Marx Treitsaurwein. Hans Burgkmair designed much of the Triumphal Procession, starting in about 1512 and contributing designs for 67 woodblocks. Other contributions were made by Albrecht Altdorfer (38 blocks), Hans Springinklee (20), Leonhard Beck (7), Hans Sch√§ufelein (2), Wolf Huber (2), and Albrecht D√ºrer (2). The designs were cut from 1516 to 1519 by a large team of block-cutters led by Jost de Negker, including Hieronymus Andreae, Cornelis Liefrinck and Willem Liefrinck. The work was not completed by Maximilian's death in 1519 and the project stalled with 139 blocks completed; a large number of portraits of courtiers and German princes were among the casualties, and were never made. D√ºrer ceased to receive the annual pension of 100 florins paid under Maximilian, and he published his Large Triumphal Carriage separately in 1522 (in the description below it is restored in its intended place as block 122 a-g); a smaller equivalent was substituted. The subjects on the individual woodblocks forming the procession include: a naked herald riding a griffin at the start of the work (block 1), then a large blank frame pulled by two horses (intended to be carved with the title), followed by a large collection of musicians, many in carts drawn by exotic animals (3-4, 17-26, 77-78 etc.), drummers, falconers and huntsmen accompanied by their prey (5-14), two carts containing jesters and fools (27-30), fencers, tournament fighters and jousters (33-56), 29 groups of standard bearers on horseback carrying the flags of Maximilian's many titles and territories (57-88), a cart for Maximilian's wedding (89-90), carriages with depictions of Maximilian's military victories (91-102), a cart for the wedding of Maximilian's son Philip I of Castile to Joanna of Castile (105), carriages with Maximilians's ancestors (106-110), soldiers and prisoners of war, and finally D√ºrer's 8-block triumphal carriage containing Maximilian himself drawn by twelve horses (122 a-g). After the carriage come representatives from foreign peoples, including exotic people from Calicut with an elephant (129), American Indians (130), soldiers, and then the baggage-train (132-137), shown descending from a hilly alpine landscape. The last block (137) shows a wagon laden with cooking-pots and a man carrying rods with shoes hanging from them. The procession is an important documentary source for the details of the musical instruments and the weapons and armour of the period. A first edition of 137 blocks running to 200 copies was published in 1526, on the order of Maximilian's grandson Archduke Ferdinand. A second edition of 135 blocks was printed in 1777, with further editions published by Adam Bartsch and then in 1883-4 by Franz Schestag. The British Museum has a composite set of 137 woodcuts drawn from three different editions, 97 from the 1526 edition, 36 from 1777, and 4 from 1796, with the text that accompanied the 1796 edition. The manuscript text has survived in Vienna, and 135 of the 139 woodblocks are in the Albertina in Vienna. The woodcut series was sometimes hand-coloured, like other prints, but it is not to be confused with a different and much shorter illuminated manuscript Triumphs of Maximilian by Albrecht Altdorfer of 1513-1515 (now Albertina), with many similar scenes, but also many in which soldiers on foot carry banners containing representations of particular campaigns of the Emperor.

Early life Born in Edinburgh in 1599, Thomas Bruce was the second son of Edward Bruce, 1st Lord Kinloss by his wife Magdalene Clerk. He succeeded to the Scottish peerage title as 3rd Lord Bruce of Kinloss in August 1613, aged 13, on the death of his elder brother, Edward Bruce, 2nd Lord Kinloss, killed in a duel with Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset. The family estates included Whorlton Castle and manor given to his father by King James I of England in 1603. The King granted the wardship of Thomas and the estates to his mother Magdalene, until he came of age at 21. In 1614 Viscount Lisle acknowledged Thomas Bruce as a matchmaker in a marriage planned between his son Robert Sidney and Elizabeth Cecil. Instead she married Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire.William Shaw & G. Dyfnallt Owen, HMC 77 Viscount De L'Isle Penshurst, vol. 5 (London, 1961), p. 156. In 1624, King James I granted Houghton House to Thomas Bruce, near Ampthill, Bedfordshire. The house was built by architects, John Thorpe and Inigo Jones, in the Jacobean and Classical style for Mary Herbert, Dowager Countess of Pembroke;http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/houghton- house/history/ it had been reverted to the King by Mary's brother, two years after the Countess' death in 1621. It became the principal residence for the Bruce family for over a century. King Charles I of England later granted him nearby Houghton Park to preserve game for the royal hunt, but persistent hunting and hawking by the local Conquest family forced the King's subsequent intervention. New titles During King Charles I's period of Personal rule, Thomas Bruce maintained close relations with the court. He attended the King for his coronation in Scotland in 1633 and was created Earl of Elgin on 21 June 1633. The year after performing in Thomas Carew's masque, Coelum Britannicum, Bruce received the degree of Master of Arts from the University of Oxford in 1636. He was invested as a Knight in 1638 at Windsor, along with William Villiers and Charles, Prince of Wales. Thomas Bruce continued in royal favour. He was created Baron Bruce of Whorlton, in the Peerage of England, on 29 July 1641. In 1643, he was appointed \\"Keeper of the King's Park\\" at Byfleet, a role he held until 1647. Civil War Although Bruce's sister Christian Cavendish, Countess of Devonshire was a notable Royalist, Bruce himself took the side of the Parliamentarians, serving on several county committees from 1644 to Pride's Purge. Shortly before the 1648 outbreak of the Second English Civil War, fellow scot, William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart, whipping boy of Charles I and husband of his relative, Catherine Bruce, appointed Bruce as principal trustee of Ham House to act on behalf of his wife, Catherine, and their daughters. The move was successful in helping protect Murray's ownership of the estate by making sequestration by the Parliamentarians both more difficult and, given Elgin's influential position with the Scottish Presbyterians, politically undesirable. Bruce was later described by Sir Philip Warwick as 'a Gentleman of a very good understanding, and of a pious, but timorous and cautious mind'. He recounted how Bruce expressed some uneasy regret for his actions, that he had tried to avoid parliament when he could and denied having been one of the handful of lords that condemned Archbishop Laud to death. Marriages and children Thomas Bruce married twice: Exton, to Anne Chichester (d.1627) (Countess of Elgin), daughter of Sir Robert Chichester. *Firstly, on 4 July 1622, he married Anne Chichester (d.1627), a daughter of Sir Robert Chichester of Raleigh (1578-1627), by his first wife, Frances Harington (d. 1615), a daughter of John Harington, 1st Baron Harington of Exton (1540-1613), and a co-heiress of her brother John Harington, 2nd Baron Harington of Exton (1592-1614).

(citing The Complete Peerage, vol I, p58) The marriage was childless. Diana had married de Vere in 1624, just a year before his death, and thus brought with her considerable estates at West Tanfield and Manfield, near Bruce's existing Yorkshire estates, as well as property in Lincolnshire and Middlesex, including Clerkenwell Priory. Thomas built in her memory, the Ailesbury Mausoleum, in the churchyard of St. Mary's Church, Maulden, in Bedfordshire, an octagonal building built over an already existing crypt.

Early life Eisenberg was born in 1921 in Munich to a religious Jewish family from Poland. Shortly after the uprising of the Nazis in the government, he fled and wandered as a refugee around Europe. He later moved to Japan. In 1941, he married a local woman. During World War II he worked with industrial factories, associating with the Axis Power countries. After the war ended, he began working with American businesses, importing iron products for the Japanese steel industry, when at the same time exporting a variety of Japanese-made products to India. At the start of the 1950s, Eisenberg expanded his business to other countries in the Far East, especially South Korea, where he invested money while mediating between the local authority to manufacturers from the East that were also doing business there. Among them were: British Electric, Siemens, MAN SE, and Fiat Automobiles. Within a decade, he managed to mediate a vast variety of projects, such as developing production lines for recycled paper and purchasing airplanes and trains. He got an award from the Korean government for his actions. Until the mid-1960s, Eisenberg was the primary factor and catalyst in the commerce between South Korea and Japan to Western countries. He got high brokerage commissions, and therefore a few of which led to local and international scandals. Eisenberg Law and his activity in Israel Eisenberg founded the company Israel Corporation, and a new law was enacted for him, allowing the company to have a tax break for 30 years. The law, which got its nickname from Eisenberg, was meant to encourage entrepreneurs. Upon getting these benefits, Eisenberg began mimicking his international actions and do them in Israel as well, which led him to settle in Savyon, Israel. With Israel Corporation he began purchasing some holdings in the companies Zim Integrated Shipping Services, Oil Refineries, and others. At the same time he took advantage of his connections to do military transactions between the Far East and Israel, and also became an exporter of weapons from Israel to countries in Africa and South America. Later on he was the first person to do commercial business between Israel and China. Eisenberg is considered a significant donor to political parties, influencing the Israeli politics. In 1979, Eisenberg founded \\"Beit Asia\\" in Tel Aviv, which he also got special tax-cuts for, where he located his stock market investments' headquarter, owned by Eisenberg‚Äôs Group. Jonathan Zohovsky, his daughter‚Äôs husband, as well as Michael Albin, who was the manager of the group, assisted him. After the Israeli 1983 stock market crash, the group had significant losses, and later on the police found that the company had been hiding information from its stockholders and Albin was found guilty. He later died in tragic reasons, and Eisenberg disconnected his relationship with his daughter and her husband. In the 1990s, his business activity began to slow down, due to involvement of other markets in the Far East and other factors. Eisenberg died in Beijing in 1997, two years before the expiration of the Eisenberg Law. Family Eisenberg was married to Leah, and the couple had five daughters and a son. His death caused a (rather public) legal controversy over the inheritance - valued at around 1 billion dollars. His son eventually got the largest portion, and continued operating the family business. Eisenberg's brother, Refael, who was a Hasidic scholar, died in 1976, leaving twelve children behind him.

It was effectively the last capitol building of Mexican California under Governor Pio Pico, in 1845‚Äì47, and was a center of social and political life for decades. The hotel was located at N. Main Street, on the east side, a few doors north of Commercial Street, a which then ran east‚Äìwest between Arcadia and Temple. The hotel was later known as the Clarendon and then as the St. Charles. Its final mailing address was 314 North Main Street. History The building was thought to exist very close to the original site of Yaanga, a prominent Tongva (or Kizh) village. The one- story adobe structure was built in 1835 by \\"three American trappers\\" ‚Äî William Wolfskill, Joseph Paulding and Richard Laughlin ‚Äî as a home for Isaac Williams, a New England merchant who had arrived in Los Angeles in 1832.

Archibald H. Gillespie, commander of the occupying forces, for whom it later served as a barracks. After that, the building became a saloon. By early 1850, the building was operating as the Bella Union Hotel. Later that year, it became Los Angeles County's first courthouse. Beginning in 1858, it was the region's transportation hub. The Overland Mail Company operated by John Butterfield (the founder of American Express) rented space for a station until it built new quarters in 1860 at Second and Spring--the present location of Mirror Building. The Wells, Fargo and Company also had their office here and Phineas Banning operated coaches to Wilmington and San Bernardino from the hotel. A second floor was added to the hotel in 1851, and a third in 1869. In 1873 the hotel was renamed the Clarendon Hotel. What had previously been the Shepard cigar and fancy store and had also served as Western Union headquarters in the city, was refitted to serve as a lounge, with reading and chess tables, and a dozen antique Elizabethan chairs from the California Theater in San Francisco. A separate stairway was built to connect the upper floors to the dining room, for ladies' use only. The new dining room accommodated 100 guests. Charles Rosseau, formerly of the Union Club in San Francisco, served as chef. The bar room was carpeted with Brussels tapestry. A building at the back with 16 rooms was connected to the main hotel of 62 rooms, and the hotel thus stretched the entire length of Commercial Street from Main to Los Angeles streets. The rooms, halls, and other facilities were newly outfitted. In early 1875, the hotel started advertising as the St. Charles.\\"Local Brevities\\", Los Angeles Herald, 24 Jan 1875, p. 3 Recollections In 1851, when Horace Bell, the author of the seminal historical work Reminiscences of a Ranger, first came to Los Angeles, the hotel was owned by James Brown Winston, a medical doctor, and Alpheus P.

It is purported to be the \\"bloodiest cabin in Arizona history;\\" between 1860 and 1890, at least twenty-one people were killed there, many of whom are buried on site. Presently, little of the cabin remains except for some foundations and small portions of the walls. A few unmarked graves have been identified, but because of theft, vandalism, and erosion, the site has been heavily damaged.  History  = Frederick Brunckow = Frederick Brunckow was born in Germany in 1830. After attending the University of Westphalia to become a mining engineer, Brunckow emigrated to the United States in 1850 and joined the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company, which eventually took him west. In 1858, Brunckow left the Sonora Company to develop his own San Pedro Silver Mine, which was located approximately eight miles southwest of what would become Tombstone, near the San Pedro River. Joining him were a chemist named John Moss, or Morse, a German cook named David Brontrager, and two miners named James and William M. Williams. Relying mainly on Mexican labor, Brunckow built a store for supplies and a cabin to be used as a sleeping quarters. A small and simple structure, the cabin was made of adobe and had a tin roof and a fireplace. On July 23, 1860, William Williams left the mine and went west to Fort Buchanan to purchase some flour. When he returned on the night of July 26, Williams found that the store had been ransacked; some of the provisions were missing and the rest had been knocked off of their shelves onto the floor. Continuing on, Williams found the source of a smell that he could not immediately identify when he arrived back at camp. His cousin, James, had been murdered and was lying among the provisions. Without hesitation, Williams ran out the door and went back to the fort to tell the soldiers. When the soldiers arrived on the following morning, they found two more bodies. Morse was lying dead in the dirt outside of camp; he had been \\"ravaged by animals.\\" Brunckow was found either near the entrance of the mine shaft or inside of it; he was reportedly killed with a rock drill. Brontrager and the Mexican laborers were missing, as well as the company's livestock. Altogether, about $3,000 worth of goods had been taken. Later that same night, Brontrager arrived at Camp Jecker and told the miners there that he had been taken hostage by the Mexican laborers. Brontrager said that the Mexicans had turned on him and his friends just a few hours after William Williams left for the fort and that they let him go at the international border because they believed him to be a good Catholic. The soldiers buried Brunckow and the others at the cabin and the killers were never apprehended. = Milton B. Duffield = Milton B. Duffield is probably best known for being the first United States Marshal appointed to Arizona Territory, a post he held from March 6, 1863, to November 25, 1865. A man \\"of iron nerve, of ruffiantly instinct, and unimpeached aim,\\" Duffield was not well-liked, but he did have a reputation for fearlessness. John Gregory Bourke once described him as wearing \\"11 firearms and a knife at one time, usually concealed.\\" In 1873, Duffield acquired ownership of Brunckow's Cabin and the mining claim, however, a man named James T. Holmes also claimed to be the owner. On June 5, 1874, Duffield arrived at Brunckow's Cabin to evict Holmes. As he approached, Duffield began \\"waving his arms and shouting like a mad-man\\" in his usual manner. Assuming that Duffield was \\"armed to the teeth,\\" as he usually was, and knowing of his violent reputation, Holmes grabbed his double-barrelled shotgun, walked out the front door, and without hesitation shot the old lawman dead. It was at this point Holmes realized that his victim was unarmed. Duffield was buried at the cabin. Holmes was arrested, tried for murder, and sentenced to three years in prison, but he escaped before having a chance to serve any of his time. The authorities did not make an effort in finding him and he was never seen in Arizona again. = Ed Schieffelin = Ed Schieffelin in 1880. Ed Schieffelin was a prospector known to history as the \\"father of Tombstone.\\" In 1877, just prior to the discovery that led to the founding of Tombstone, Schieffelin established a \\"permanent camp\\" at Brunckow's Cabin to be used as a base for exploring. With his brother, Al, and a fellow prospector named Richard Gird, Schieffelin searched the area for weeks, constantly on the lookout for hostile Apaches, but his stay was uneventful. There were, however, \\"several fresh graves\\" at Brunckow's Cabin that served as \\"mute testimony to recent Apache raids.\\" Schieffelin is said to have used the cabin's fireplace for assaying silver ore samples. Furthermore, the location of the San Pedro Silver Mine persuaded him to search the rocky outcroppings to the northeast. = Frank Stilwell = Frank Stilwell, an outlaw Cowboy and member of the Clanton faction during the famed Earp-Clanton feud, owned the land and the cabin for a while. On March 20, 1882, Wyatt Earp found him lying on a flatcar in the Tucson train station, apparently intent on killing Virgil Earp. Earp killed him. = Newspaper accounts = By the 1880s, Arizona newspapers were already reporting on the \\"ghostly apparitions\\" said to be haunting the cabin or the many different murders that had taken place. In 1881, Prescott's Arizona Democrat discussed the cabin's history of \\"uninterrupted.... violence and murder,\\" affirming that between the time of Frederick Brunckow's death and the writing of the newspaper, an additional seventeen men had met their end at the cabin. The newspaper also attested to the site's haunted reputation: \\"The graves lie thick around the old adobe house.... Prospectors and miners avoid the spot as they would the plague, and many of them will tell you that the unquiet spirits of the departed are wont to revisit.... and wander about the scene.\\" A May 20, 1897, issue of the Tombstone Prospector said that on one occasion a gang of bandits fought each other for the loot they had recently stolen from a Wells Fargo bullion wagon. Apparently, they could not decide on how to divide their spoils so they turned against one another and were shot to death. All five of the bandits were later found dead and the load of bullion was recovered at the scene. The Tombstone Prospector also mentions a ghost that walks around the cabin at night, but when somebody tries to approach it vanishes and reappears somewhere else.

Along with a range of teaching and research interests, he wrote several surgical textbooks, and played a leading role in university and medical administration. Born in West Yorkshire, he served as a fighter pilot in the First World War before resuming medical studies in Edinburgh. After working and teaching in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the 1920s and 1930s, Illingworth was appointed Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow, in 1939. Over the next 25 years, he established the Glasgow School of surgery, with generations of his students influencing surgical research and teaching in Britain and abroad. His textbooks were also highly influential, including his co-authorship of Text Book of Surgical Pathology (1932). Illingworth travelled and lectured widely, and helped initiate and present a 1963 television series on postgraduate medical training. His research included early work in the 1960s on hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Illingworth's administrative and leadership roles included his Presidency of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow (1962 to 1964) and Dean of Faculties at the University of Glasgow (1978 to 1981). His honours included a knighthood (1961), Honorary Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland (1961 to 1965), and a range of honorary degrees. Honorary fellowships included those conferred by the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. For his devotion to surgical science, Illingworth was awarded the 1964 Lister Medal. In retirement, Illingworth wrote biographies of William Hunter and Hector Hetherington. He also helped establish the charity Tenovus-Scotland in 1967, and was awarded the Nuffield Trust's Rock Carling Fellowship for 1970. Portraits of Illingworth by Alberto Morrocco are held at the Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, and the annual Illingworth Prize for medical students is administered by the University of Glasgow. Illingworth's autobiography, There is a History in All Men's Lives, was published in 1988. Early life and education Charles Frederick William Illingworth was born on 8 May 1899 in Halifax, West Yorkshire. His pre-university education took place at Heath Grammar School (sometimes referred to as Halifax Grammar School) up until 1915. In 1916, he began medical studies at the University of Edinburgh. His studies were interrupted by military service during the First World War when, in 1917, he joined the Royal Flying Corps. Illingworth saw action in France in 1918, which ended when he was shot down (forced landing) in August over the Somme and held as a prisoner-of-war at Ingolstadt, Bavaria, Germany. After returning home following the end of the war, he continued his studies at Edinburgh and graduated MB ChB (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) in 1922. Interwar years (Edinburgh) After qualifying as a medical doctor, Illingworth undertook a period as house physician at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary. He then continued with further training in his chosen speciality of surgery, studying and working from 1922 in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh with Harold Stiles and David Wilkie. By 1925, Illingworth had qualified FRCSEd (Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh). In the period 1926‚Äì7, he studied abroad at the Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Missouri, USA (now the Barnes-Jewish Hospital): > \\"During the years 1926‚Äì27 the following men arrived for various prolonged > periods of study [...] C. F. W. Illingworth, of Edinburgh, Scotland, came > here as a fellow of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland > and stayed a year. He obtained his fellowship under the direction and help > of Professor Wilkie of Edinburgh, who sent him here. He in turn was replaced > by Bruce Dick, also of the University of Edinburgh, who came on a fellowship > of the International Health Board of the Rockefeller Foundation and stayed > eight months. Both Dr. Illingworth and Dr. Dick co-operated with Dr. Gopher > in some experimental studies.\\" The following year (1928) Illingworth married Eleanor Mary Bennett, with whom he would have four sons. In 1929, Illingworth's thesis was awarded with a Gold Medal. During this period in Edinburgh, Illingworth also wrote or co-wrote two surgical textbooks which remained in print for many years, going through many editions. Text Book of Surgical Pathology (1932) was co-authored with Bruce M. Dick, and went through twelve editions by 1979. The other textbook, Short Text Book of Surgery (1938) reached a ninth edition by 1972. In the three years before the outbreak of the Second World War, Illingworth held the position of Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (1936‚Äì1939).Details of Illingworth's conservatorship of this museum are found in This source is based upon the 1978 work The Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh by Violet Tansey and D.E.C. Mekie. A photograph of Illingworth is on page 32. By 1939, he had obtained his ChM (Master of Surgery) qualification. Professor of Surgery (Glasgow) It was in 1939, with the country facing the upheaval and uncertainties of the Second World War, that Illingworth moved from Edinburgh to take up the role of Regius Professor of Surgery, Glasgow. He was appointed to this Chair during the leadership of that university by Hector Hetherington, and would hold this position for 25 years from 1939 to 1964. Illingworth, who arrived at a low point in the history of the faculty, worked to raise and re-establish the status of the University of Glasgow Medical School, playing \\"a major role in establishing the University's high reputation in the practice and teaching of surgery after the Second World War\\". According to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: \\"Under Illingworth's leadership, the Glasgow school achieved worldwide renown for excellence in the practice and teaching of medicine and surgery, and also in research\\". Illingworth continued to write on surgical methods, with revisions to existing works along with the publication of new textbooks. Text Book of Surgical Treatment (1942) would be issued in a fourth edition in 1952. He was also awarded lectureships and travelled abroad during this period, such as when he delivered the 1958 Strauss Lecture under the title 'The Endocrine Aspects of Breast Cancer'. In 1960, Illingworth was the first McLaughlin Foundation-Edward Gallie Visiting Professor, in which capacity he visited several universities and hospitals in Canada to teach and lecture. Illingworth's research included studies of the medical use of oxygen under pressure. In 1961, he gave the Legg Memorial Lecture at King's College Hospital Medical School on 17 November under the title 'Treatment of Arterial Occlusion under Oxygen at Two-atmospheres Pressure'. The Daryl Hart Lectureship of 1962 was on the same topic: 'Experimental and Clinical Observations Under Hyperbaric Oxygenation' Illingworth's work on hyperbaric oxygenation in the early 1960s would come to be seen as one of the landmarks in the development of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Illingworth's support of medical training extended beyond the traditional settings of universities and medical schools, and included the use of the medium of television. In 1963, he and his colleagues introduced a series of television programmes for doctors on Scottish Television. There were twelve episodes in the series (titled 'Post- Graduate Medicine'), broadcast monthly from 11 March 1963: \\"for hospital doctors and general practitioners and [...] in the nature of a post-graduate class\\". In addition to these new methods, Illingworth continued his lecturing and teaching, and in 1963 was appointed a visiting professor at the University of Sheffield. Over the course of a week in November of that year, he lectured to both the public, students and fellow doctors, and delivered the Ernest Finch Memorial Lecture in memory of Sir Ernest Finch. In 1964, Illingworth formally retired from hospital work. His retirement as Regius Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow was announced in December 1963 in the London Gazette by the Scottish Home and Health Department, along with the news of his appointed successor Andrew Watt Kay, though the retirement did not take effect until the following year on 30 September 1964. Society and university administration As well as practising, teaching and administrating as Glasgow's Regius Professor of Surgery, Illingworth also held positions within the hierarchies of a range of medical and learned societies, colleges and associations. In 1955 he was President of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, and President for two terms of the Society of Academic and Research Surgery (1956 and 1957). In the early 1960s, Illingworth played a central role in the history of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, or the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons as it was then known. From 1960 to 1962 he served two annual terms of that organisation's Visitorship, followed from 1962 to 1964 by two annual terms as President of what was by then called the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. It was during this period, in 1963, that Illingworth was granted the title of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Glasgow (FRCSGlas). This award followed the recent name change (instigated by Illingworth's predecessor as President) that changed the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons from a Faculty to a Royal College. This period also saw attempts made to standardise and consolidate the range of diplomas offered across the UK medical colleges, with some of these changes proposed and debated by Illingworth during his leadership of the College. The following year, furthering his contributions to administration, Illingworth was one of those organising the Lister Centenary events held in Glasgow from 26 to 29 September 1965; he was also involved in appeals to raise funds during the commemorative period. The celebrations saw delegates from around the world attending a two- day scientific meeting arranged by Illingworth at the University of Glasgow. The conclusion of the event included a graduation ceremony on 29 September 1965 when honorary degrees were conferred on \\"twelve eminent medical men from various countries\\", including Illingworth himself who received an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree. A few days later, a similar event was held to celebrate the Moynihan Centenary at the University of Leeds. Illingworth again received an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree along with three others (Sir Harry Platt, Lord Brock, Jan Nuboer), with the ceremony taking place on 4 October 1965. The ceremony had been preceded by Illingworth delivering the Moynihan Centenary Lecture. On 6 October 1965, Illingworth gave a talk at the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow titled 'Joseph Lister ‚Äì Surgeon- Biologist'. On 14 October 1965, again as part of the Lister Centenary celebrations, Illingworth delivered a talk titled 'Lister's Legacy to Humanity' at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Washington DC, USA, to the Washington branch of the English-Speaking Union. This dinner and talk was attended by some 400 guests, including former US Vice-President Richard Nixon, former Governor of New Jersey and president of pharmaceutical company Warner- Lambert Alfred E. Driscoll, and Senator Joseph Lister Hill, with the wife of the latter recalling the event in her memoirs. As part of the event, Illingworth on behalf of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, received an oil portrait of Lord Lister, commissioned by Warner-Lambert from US artist Norman Rockwell. The Lister Centenary celebrations occurred in the year following Illingworth's formal retirement, but he continued to be active in administrative and honorary roles with colleges, societies and at the University of Glasgow well into his later years, with several of the positions reflecting his interest in the history of medicine. From 1974 to 1980, he served as Honorary Librarian of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. From 1978 to 1981 he was Dean of Faculties at the University of Glasgow. From 1979 to 1981 he was President of the Scottish Society of the History of Medicine. The dates of Illingworth's presidency are at Honours and awards The contributions made by Illingworth to the surgical profession were recognised by a range of professional and civil honours. In 1946, he was appointed CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire). This was followed in 1961 by the title of Knight Bachelor, granted as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours List. He was also appointed Honorary Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland and held this position from 1961 to 1965. Following his retirement, Illingworth was Extra Surgeon to the Queen in Scotland from 1965 until his death. Numerous national medical associations conferred honorary fellowships on Illingworth, both within Britain and abroad. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the American College of Surgeons ('Abdominal Surgery', 1954). Four years later, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. At the awarding ceremony on 11 June 1958, he delivered a speech addressing those starting out on their medical careers. University honours, in addition to the Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees received in 1965 during the Lister and Moynihan centenaries, included two Honorary Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degrees, one from the University of Sheffield (1962), and one from the University of Belfast (July 1963). That same year, it was announced that Illingworth would receive the Lister Medal. The announcement of the award in the Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England stated that it was for: > \\"...his devotion to surgical science over a long period; and in particular > for his contributions to knowledge of jaundice and diseases of the biliary > tract, of peptic ulcer, and of the endocrine aspects of the treatment of > cancer; and for his perception of the importance of the use of oxygen in > treatment under hyperbaric conditions as a field for physiological > research.\\" Illingworth's Lister Oration was delivered on 9 April 1964 at the Royal College of Surgeons of England in London under the title 'On the Interdependence of Science and the Healing Art'. The Lister Medal itself was presented following the Oration, both events taking place as part of what was then known as the Lister Festival. The description on page 409 is followed by a photograph on page 410 of Illingworth after being presented with the medal. A few months later, Illingworth delivered the Lister Lecture of the Canadian Medical Association in Vancouver, Canada, on 24 June 1964, under the title 'Wound Sepsis‚ÄîFrom Carbolic Acid to Hyperbaric Oxygen'. As a recognised elder statesman of his profession, more honorary fellowships followed. One such had been conferred earlier in the year when Illingworth was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, together with two other surgeons: Sir Arthur Porritt and Erik Husfeldt. In 1965, Illingworth was invited by the Council of the College of Physicians, Surgeons and Gynaecologists of South Africa to give the 1965 Louis Mirvish Memorial Lecture. He was also invited as a distinguished guest to the 45th South African Medical Congress (MASA), and was made an Honorary Fellow of the College of Surgeons of South Africa. Illingworth travelled abroad again the following year to receive the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. This was conferred on 21 January 1966 at the College's 35th Annual Convocation, held at the Place des Arts in Montreal, Canada. He was one of three honoured that year, along with Lord Brock and Sir Peter Medawar. The awarding of the honorary fellowship is described on page 510 and includes a photograph. Retirement and legacy Following his retirement in 1964, Illingworth held the title of Emeritus Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow, and continued to carry out locum work into his seventies. In these later years, he still travelled and lectured, with plans reported in August 1966 for a three-month stay in Kenya to co- ordinate planning in a new medical school. He gave the 14th MacEwen Memorial Lecture at the University of Glasgow on 21 November 1967, under the title 'The Advancement of Surgery'.Published the following year and reviewed in Also in 1967, Illingworth was one of the founders of Tenovus-Scotland, a medical charity established by ten initial donors in a similar way to the Tenovus cancer charity based in Wales. Other charity fund-raising by Illingworth included organising a concert in October 1969. This was performed by the Scottish National Orchestra and conducted by Sir Arthur Bliss. This helped fund a research unit at the University of Glasgow for kidney diseases. Two biographies by Illingworth were published in this period. The Story of William Hunter (1967) is a first-person account and history of the 18th-century Scottish anatomist William Hunter. A review in Medical History stated that: > \\"William Hunter has been neglected by medical historians in comparison with > his brother John. Sir Charles Illingworth's book has done much to make good > this deficiency and will, it is hoped, reawaken interest in him, not only as > one of the leading gynaecologists of the eighteenth century but also as a > pioneer in the promotion of reform and improvement in medical education.\\" The second biography was of Hector Hetherington, the Principal of the University of Glasgow who had appointed Illingworth to the university's Regius Chair of Surgery in 1939. Illingworth's University Statesman: Sir Hector Hetherington (1971) was excerpted in The Glasgow Herald, and reviewed in The Economist. Illingworth continued to write on healthcare training and reform, writing the monograph The Sanguine Mystery (1970), subtitled: This Bloody and Butcherly Department of the Healing Art. This work was produced for his Rock Carling Fellowship, also forming the topic of the Rock Carling Lecture for 1970 from the Nuffield Trust. An article by Illingworth on medical training was published in The Times in July 1971. The death of his wife Mary (Lady Illingworth) was announced in The Glasgow Herald in December of that year. Many years later, Illingworth published an autobiographical account of his life, with royalties going to the Tenovus-Scotland charity he had helped found. Titled There is a History in All Men's Lives (1988), it had been previewed in The Glasgow Herald in December 1987, and was reviewed in the British Medical Journal in April 1988. Three years later, Illingworth died on 23 February 1991 in Glasgow at the age of 91. The portrait of Illingworth held at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, dated 1965, was painted by Alberto Morrocco. A different portrait by Alberto Morocco, from 1966, is held at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. Illingworth's legacy includes the University of Glasgow's Illingworth Prize, which he established in 1964, \\"awarded annually on the recommendation of the Regius Professor of Surgery\\" for displays of \\"scholarship and general achievement\\" by a third-year medical student. Illingworth and his family's connections with Tenovus- Scotland continue to be commemorated by one of its grants, the Lady Illingworth Award. The impact of Illingworth on his profession was summed up in an obituary written in 2008 for one of his students and successors: > \\"The school of surgery founded in Glasgow by Sir Charles Illingworth came to > dominate academic surgery in Britain for a generation or more. Sir Charles's > pupils occupied more than 20 chairs of surgery in this country and abroad, > and played an important role in shaping the mould of surgical research and > teaching.\\" Selected publications ;Lectures and papers *9 October 1950 (RCSEng) ‚Äì Carcinoma of the Head of the Pancreas, Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 1951 January; 8(1): 53‚Äì63. *8 October 1954 (RCSEng) ‚Äì Massive Gastro-Intestinal Haemorrhage, Ann R Coll Surg Engl. 1955 May; 16(5): 337‚Äì341. *William Hunter's manuscripts and letters: the Glasgow collection, Med Hist. 1971 April; 15(2): 181‚Äì186. *Some old books and ancient coins from the Hunter Collection, Med Hist. 1973 April; 17(2): 168‚Äì173. ;Textbooks and books *Text Book of Surgical Pathology (1932) with Bruce M.

The sixteenth episode of the series is co-written by series co- creator Tony Gayton and Tom Brady and directed by series co-creator Joe Gayton. In the episode, The Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) reveals himself to be the \\"White Spirit\\" as he aids the Sioux in their war with the railroad. Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan) also plays his role and hijacks the train taking Durant (Colm Meaney), Eva (Robin McLeavy), and Doc Whitehead (Grainger Hines) to Chicago. Plot The Swede and Reverend Cole meet a band of Sioux Indians. Leader Yellow Dog (Darcy Singer) gives a white wolf pelt to The Swede, who explains to Cole that the Sioux rescued him after he was chased out of town. He confirms that he is the \\"White Spirit\\", and the two distribute rifles to the Indians. While the train to Chicago is being prepared, Durant hallucinates about his son. Lily (Dominique McElligott) informs him that she has telegraphed his wife, who will meet him when he arrives. He begs her to stay with him, but she insists on remaining behind to oversee railroad business. Elam (Common) tries to stop a pregnant Eva from escorting Durant as his nurse, but she says her \\"condition\\" is not his concern and explains that Durant is paying her, just like he is paying Elam. Cullen (Anson Mount) wants to flee with Doc, but Lily says Durant could die without Doc to treat him. Cullen argues that Doc will die if he does not leave town and adds that if Durant dies, Lily will not have to share Durant's bed anymore. Appalled, she slaps him. Doc tells Cullen he will not abandon Durant despite the death warrant. Cullen relents, making Doc promise to get off the train before it reaches Chicago. On the train, Eva tells Doc that Durant's fever is down. At church, Joseph shows Ruth (Kasha Kropinski) a Bible passage that Cole marked and left for him: \\"Jesus said to them, if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak to buy one.\\" They ponder its meaning. A track explosion halts Durant's train and a band of armed Sioux board, followed by a sword-wielding, Bible-quoting Cole, who orders Durant to publish his manifesto on the front page of the New-York Tribune or else all hostages will die. A reluctant Durant agrees. Back in town, Lily shows Cullen a telegram sent from Durant's train. Recognizing the text as John Brown propaganda and recalling Cole mentioning John Brown in the past, Cullen leaves the office in haste. He later requests permission to board the hijacked train. Once inside, he tells Cole that killing innocent people will not save the Indians. He suggests that Cole pray, knowing God would lead him to do the right thing, As he leaves, Cole shouts, \\"Blood is God here!\\" and impales the engineer (Peter Strand Rumpel) on his sword. Lily arrives and confers with Cullen and Elam. Cullen says Cole is sober but insane and advocates taking Cole's train by force. Lily insists on negotiating. Inside, Durant speaks with Cole about the sacrifices they have made to achieve their goals. Cole admits to being a terrible father, to which Durant agrees that \\"great men often are\\" and adds that his wife never forgave him for it. Cole says the manifesto is his legacy to his children, like Durant's legacy is the railroad. But Durant says Cole is \\"on the wrong side of history\\" and will be vilified. Cullen and Elam fire on the hijacked train with rifles, hitting the guards. Inside, Eva and Doc grab the wounded Yellow Dog and hold him until he bleeds out. Cole holds Doc at gunpoint, prompting Cullen and Elam to stand down. Cole retreats inside but states that he wants to see his children. While keeping watch on Cole's train, Elam confides to Cullen that Eva is carrying his baby. Lily and Joseph find Ruth at church and explain the situation. Ruth claims that she can do nothing, but Joseph begs her to do this one last thing for him, even though she does not love him anymore. Outside the train, The Swede escorts authorities toward the train car. Cullen curses him for leading them to Doc. Inside, Cole tearfully apologizes to Ruth for being a bad father. Crying, she forgives and embraces him. Joseph then tells Cole that Jesus will only forgive him if he lets the hostages go. Cole whispers that he is going to kill them all, but is doing it all for him. Joseph tells him he loves him, then stabs him in the gut with a knife, and he falls to the floor, only able to gasp \\"Behold your legacy\\" before he dies. Ruth, shocked, collapses sobbing over her father's corpse. Joseph exits the train car and hands Cullen the bloody knife. The authorities take Doc into custody. As the track is repaired, Elam tells Eva they need to discuss the baby when she comes back from Chicago. \\"You mean your baby,\\" she says. A weak Durant tells Lily that he needs his wife's forgiveness for \\"everything.\\" She says goodbye and leaves. Doc asks Cullen to be the one who executes him, adding that there is no honor in the way he has been living, but he wishes to die with some. Doc kneels and urges Cullen to be strong. Cullen closes his eyes and shoots Doc in the back of the head.  Production  Regarding his character's demise in this episode, Tom Noonan stated: \\"I sort of knew all along that might happen in the second season... When it became clear it was going to happen, it was sad. I like the show a lot. I like the people. It's also sad to die when you have a part, and you've been through it a number of times.

He has been convicted and jailed in France under the Gayssot Act, which bars Holocaust denial.  Biography  Vincent Reynouard was, according to his own writings, attracted by National Socialism at the beginning of his teenage years: \\"Around 14 years old, I was able to study photos of the Third Reich. I rapidly understood that true socialism, the kind I aspired to, had been realized by Adolf Hitler\\". A student at the ISMRA in Caen in the early 90s, he created the \\"Normandy Association for the Awakening of the Citizen\\" (Association normande pour l‚Äô√©veil du citoyen), which distributed a bulletin named \\"New Vision\\" (Nouvelle vision), co-authoring it with R√©mi Pontier. In it, he declared being part of the \\"post-revisionist\\" Holocaust denial movement derived from Robert Faurisson, Alain Guionnet, and Olivier Mathieu, aiming not only to denounce, what he sees as the \\"myth of the Shoah\\" but also the \\"Jewish control\\" over the modern world. Reynouard was expelled for some time from his university campus for distributing pamphlets and stickers. He also had an active role in the French and European Nationalist Party in which he was briefly the Secretary General in 1991. Holocaust denial activities and criminal convictions In 1991, Reynouard was convicted of distributing Holocaust denial literature.2 French Teacher Suspended for Holocaust Denial Activities, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (January 13, 1997). Reynouard had given high school students materials \\"questioning the existence of the gas chambers\\".Julie C. Suk, \\"Denying Experience: Holocaust Denial and the Free Speech Theory of the State\\" in The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses\\" in The Content and Context of Hate Speech: Rethinking Regulation and Responses (eds. Michael Herz & Peter Molnar: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 153. He was tried along with Remi Pontier, the first two people convicted under the Fabius-Gayssot law. Both were members of the neo-Nazi French and European Nationalist Party.2 Neo-nazis Tried for Spreading Revisionist Literature in France, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (November 12, 1991). Although convicted, he was permitted to continue teaching mathematics at a Honfleur, Normandy high school until 1997, when he was suspended after he was \\"found to be using the school computer to file documents denying the Holocaust and the fax machine to send the writings to his followers\\" and \\"giving his students statistical equations regarding the rate of mortality in Nazi concentration camps\\". In the fall of 2000, Reynouard affiliated himself with the Vrij Historisch Onderzoek, a Belgian Holocaust denial and Nazi-sympathizer group. At the time, Reynouard was being investigated by French authorities, and he had chosen to go into exile in Belgium, where he took up residence with a Catholic fundamentalist group in Ixelles, Brussels with close ties to the Society of Saint Pius X.Stephen Roth, Antisemitism Worldwide, 2000/1, Stephen Roth Institute, p. 96.Bertelsmann Stiftung, Strategies for Combating Right-wing Extremism in Europe (Brookings Institution Press, 2009), p. 151. Reynouard ran the group's French-language operations. In 2004, Reynouard was convicted by a French court of crimes under the 1990 Gayssot Act for distributing a pamphlet and videocassette that questioned the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre, in which many French villagers were killed. He was sentenced to 24 months in prison, of which 18 months were suspended. In 2005, Reynouard mailed a 16-page pamphlet entitled \\"Holocaust? What Is Being Hidden from You\\" to chambers of commerce, museums, and town halls across France.Erik Bleich, The Freedom to Be Racist?: How the United States and Europe Struggle to Preserve Freedom and Combat Racism (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 143 & 183.Michael Whine, \\"Expanding Holocaust Denial and Legislation Against It\\" in Extreme Speech and Democracy (eds. Ivan Hare & James Weinstein). The pamphlet claimed that the Holocaust was \\"propaganda\\". As a result, in 2007 Reynouard was sentenced to one year in prison and fined ‚Ç¨10,000. In November 2015, Reynouard was tried before a Normandy court for Holocaust denial in Facebook posts. Reynouard, who chose to represent himself at trial, was sentenced to two years in jail; the sentence was enhanced due to Reynouard's prior convictions.Michael Bazyler, Holocaust, Genocide, and the Law: A Quest for Justice in a Post-Holocaust World (Oxford University Press, 2016), pp. 194-95.

The text received widespread attention when first publicized in 2012 for the implication that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. The fragment was first presented by Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen L. King, who suggested that the papyrus contained a fourth-century Coptic translation of a gospel likely composed in Greek in the late second century. Following an investigative Atlantic article by Ariel Sabar published online in June 2016, King conceded that the evidence now \\"presses in the direction of forgery.\\" Radiocarbon dating determined that the physical papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on a scrap of medieval papyrus. Publication After Professor Karen King's announcement of the existence of a papyrus fragment featuring the words \\"Jesus said to them, 'my wife...'\\" at the International Congress of Coptic Studies in Rome on September 18, 2012, scholarly publication of the text with commentary was slated for the Harvard Theological Review in January 2013. On January 3, 2013, King and Kathryn Dodgson (director of communications for Harvard Divinity School) confirmed to CNN that publication was being delayed pending the results of (in Dodgson's words) \\"further testing and analysis of the fragment, including testing by independent laboratories with the resources and specific expertise necessary to produce and interpret reliable results.\\" A revised version of the article appeared in the Harvard Theological Review in April 2014, together with several scientific reports on the testing of the papyrus. In response to Ariel Sabar's article in The Atlantic, the Harvard Theological Review issued a statement saying that it had never committed itself to the authenticity of the papyrus and refused to print a retraction of King's article. Retraction Watch called the journal's decision \\"a cop-out of...Biblical proportions.\\" Text One side of the fragmentary text reads, word-for-word: ...not [to] me. My mother gave me life...The disciples said to Jesus,...deny. Mary is (not?) worthy of it. ...Jesus said to them, \\"My wife...she is able to be my disciple...Let wicked people swell up...As for me, I am with her in order to...an image ... The opposite side of the text reads, word-for-word: ...my moth[er]...three...forth ... The next two lines of this side feature illegible ink traces. Features The fragment is rectangular, approximately . According to reports, \\"the fragment has eight incomplete lines of writing on one side and is badly damaged on the other side, with only three faded words and a few letters of ink that are visible, even with the use of infrared photography and computer-aided enhancement.\\" King and AnneMarie Luijendijk, an associate professor of religion at Princeton University, named the fragment the \\"Gospel of Jesus's Wife\\" for reference purposes but have since acknowledged that the name was inflammatory. Asked about her handling of the public disclosure of the fragment, King admitted that she had \\"...misjudged just how inflammatory that title would turn out to be\\". According to Tom Bartlett of The Chronicle of Higher Education, \\"she's been asking around for ideas on a new, less exciting name\\". They further suggested the text was written by Egyptian Christians before AD 400; it is in the language they believed was used by those people at that time. They considered that the papyrus fragment comes from a codex, rather than a scroll, as text appears on both sides. King has stated that the fragment should not be taken as proof that the historical Jesus got married. Testing has dated the papyrus itself to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries, and Professor Christian Askeland of Indiana Wesleyan University has shown that the text is written in Lycopolitan, a Coptic dialect that fell out of use during or prior to the sixth century. With reference to the speculative source of the text on the fragment, King and Luijendijk used the term \\"gospel\\" in a capacious sense, as it includes all early Christian writings about Jesus' career. Initial interpretations of the text King told the International Congress of Coptic Studies that the text does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a translation of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years after the death of Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to the second half of the second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip. King later, in a 2012 television documentary, commented on the possible implication of the papyrus fragment: Ben Witherington, Professor of New Testament Interpretation at the Asbury Theological Seminary, said that while the text might contribute to the study of Gnosticism in the 2nd or 4th century, it should not be considered significant for those studying Jesus in a 1st-century historical context. He further explained that, \\"during the rise of the monastic movement, you had quite a lot of monk-type folks and evangelists who travelled in the company of a sister-wife\\" and that the term \\"wife\\" was open to interpretation. Father Henry Wansbrough echoed the same sentiments: Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary and others have suggested that the fragment appears to have been intentionally cut, most likely in modern times. They further suggest that this leads to the possibility that in context Jesus may not have even been speaking of a literal wife. =Links to conspiracy theories= The modern idea that Jesus was married is largely attributable to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, a book by Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln that is considered a work of pseudohistory that relies on conspiracy theories. Its thesis was that Jesus had been married to Mary Magdalene, and that the legends of the Holy Grail were symbolic accounts of his bloodline in Europe. This thesis became much more widely circulated after it was made the center of the plot of The Da Vinci Code, a best-selling 2003 novel by author Dan Brown. King rejected any link between The Da Vinci Code and the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. =Other text= The fragment also includes the line, \\"she will be able to be my disciple\\". The New York Times states that debates over whether Jesus married Mary Magdalene or another woman, as well as debates over whether or not he had female disciples can be traced to the early centuries of Christianity. King, however, contends that, prior to the recently published papyrus fragment, no texts exist which claim that Jesus was married, but that the canonical gospels clearly imply that Jesus had female disciples. Provenance Until June 2016, nothing definite was known about the provenance of the papyrus. Before the appearance of Ariel Sabar's article, it was reported that an anonymous owner had acquired the fragment in 1997 as part of a cache of papyri and other documents. This cache was said to have been purchased from a German-American collector who, in turn, had acquired it in the 1960s in East Germany. Among the other documents in that cache were: (a) a type-written letter dated July 15, 1982 addressed to one Hans-Ulrich Laukamp from Prof. Dr. Peter Munro (√Ñgyptologisches Seminar, Freie Universit√§t Berlin) which only mentions one of the papyri, reporting that a colleague, Prof. Fecht, had identified it as a 2nd ‚Äì 4th-century AD fragment of the Gospel of John in Coptic, and giving recommendations as to its preservation; and (b) an undated and unsigned hand- written note in German and seemingly referring to the Gospel of Jesus' Wife fragment. According to this note, \\"Professor Fecht\\" believed it to be the only instance of a text in which Jesus uses direct speech to refer to a wife. Professor Gerhard Fecht was on the faculty of Egyptology at the Free University of Berlin. Laukamp died in 2001, Fecht in 2006 and Munro in 2009. In June 2016, Ariel Sabar published an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues -- Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house -- or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz denied that he or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted that he might have been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text. Authenticity =Initial evaluations= Before King published the discovery of the fragment, she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review the fragment. They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills which would have been required to forge the fragment and because the papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian, the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed the fragment as fake. Immediately after King's presentation of the fragment in Rome, doubts began to be expressed about its authenticity. Further investigation of the language and the script and comparison with the clearly forged Gospel of John belonging to the same group of papyri corroborated the initial doubts. By the end of 2014, there was a general consensus that the papyrus was a fake. Eventually, Ariel Sabar's tracing of the provenance to Walter Fritz in 2016 provided the final proof, and King conceded that the evidence \\"presse[d] in the direction of forgery.\\" Others noted that the handwriting, grammar, shape of the papyrus, and the ink's color and quality made it suspect. Professor Francis Watson of Durham University published a paper on the papyrus fragment suggesting that the text was a \\"patchwork of texts\\" from the Gospel of Thomas which had been copied and assembled in a different order. In summer, 2015, Professor Watson edited and introduced six articles in the journal New Testament Studies, all arguing against authenticity of the text; these articles have been put online by Professor Mark Goodacre of Duke University. In defense of the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on the Coptic language, concluded that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has the same kind of grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to disagree about the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language. =Radiocarbon dating= A radiocarbon dating analysis of the papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard University and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700‚Äì800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern. =Analysis of text= However, while the papyrus itself is medieval in origin, further analysis has suggested that the text itself includes additional errors that suggest it is not authentic. In October 2012, Andrew Bernhard observed that there is a close resemblance between Grondin's Interlinear of the Gospel of Thomas and the text that the forger appeared to have used to compose the text of the Gospel. Karen King has now made available the interlinear translation provided to her by the owner of the papyrus, and Bernhard has shown that every line shows evidence of copying from Grondin's Interlinear. Leo Depuydt of Brown University found it ridiculous that in the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, the word \\"my\\" in the phrase \\"my wife\\" is written in bold, as if to stress the idea that Jesus was married. Depuydt also said that he had never seen bold writing used in a single Coptic text before. He wrote: \\"The effect is something like: 'My wife. Get it? MY wife. You heard that right.' The papyrus fragment seems ripe for a Monty Python sketch‚Ä¶. If the forger had used italics in addition, one might be in danger of losing one's composure.\\" Christian Askeland's linguistic analysis of the text shows that it is in a dialect which fell out of use well before AD 741. He concluded that the text must have been written on a fragment of medieval papyrus by a modern forger. Dr. Askeland also found it suspicious that the author of the fragment wrote the same letter in different ways. In addition, Askeland showed that the fragment is \\"a match for a papyrus fragment that is clearly a forgery.\\" This second fragment, containing part of the Gospel of John, belongs to the same anonymous owner, and is now overwhelmingly considered a fake. This is because that fragment of the Gospel of John appeared to have been copied from every second line of an online translation of John's Gospel in an ancient Coptic dialect called Lycopolitan; also, the Lycopolitan language died out prior to the sixth century, and the John fragment was carbon-dated to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries. Askeland argues that the John fragment was written by the same person, in the same ink, and with the same instrument as the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. Professor King felt that these concerns were legitimate, but that there was still a chance that the gospel was authentic. The Atlantic reported that despite King's reservations, the text was widely considered a fake. King later conceded, saying that evidence suggests that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife is a forgery.

Long inactive, it was converted into an ornithological observation tower in the late 19th century. History The area around Gammon Point is particularly treacherous, and a petition to congress led to the construction of a stone tower on the same lines as the Race Point Light. A stone keeper's house was also erected on the site. This tower's light was first lit on November 21, 1816, and kept by Samuel Peak; he was succeeded by his son John, who remained at the station until its closure. The tower was modified somewhat over time, with a brick extension raising the focal height to . Traffic through the port was heavy, and it was decided to build an offshore tower to replace a lightship at a nearby shoal. This lighthouse, the Bishop and Clerks Light, rendered the Point Gammon Light obsolete, and the latter was deactivated in 1858, the year the new tower was first lit. John Peak moved briefly to the new station but served there only a year. The abandoned tower remained standing at the point, and with vandalism and other damage there was some thought of demolishing it, though this never came to pass. Instead, the tower was sold in 1872. In 1882 Great Island was purchased by Charles B. Cory, the ornithologist, for use as a game preserve and bird sanctuary. He restored the tower and added a structure on top for bird-watching, replacing the long absent lantern; the keeper's house was used to house his butterfly collection. Cory lost his fortune in a stock market crash, and in 1914 he sold the land to Malcolm Greene Chace, a banker from Rhode Island; the property containing the old light has remained in the family since. In 1935 the keeper's house was dismantled and the stone reused to build a small house elsewhere on the island. The tower itself was updated in the 1970s for use as a summer house, with a new chamber set atop the old stone tower for use as a bedroom. The altered tower remains at the point, though it has not been lit as an aid to navigation for over 150 years.

Brock started the season strongly with a podium in Adelaide. A heavy crash at Phillip Island slid him down the order. After re-building the #62 from scratch, he suffered another crash at Sydney Motorsport Park, resulting in another write-off.

In February 2013, the team entered the Liqui-Moly Bathurst 12 Hour with its two Mercedes SLS AMG GT3s. #36 was piloted by Bernd Schneider, Thomas J√§ger and Alex Roloff, while car #63 was piloted by regular driver Peter Hackett and V8 Supercars drivers Lee Holdsworth and Tim Slade. It was car #63 that would take pole position on the Saturday, with Lee Holdsworth behind the wheel, with a 2.06.22, but could only finish the race in 6th position, five laps behind the race winners after an incident late in the race whilst leading. This left the #36 machine to take the team's first Bathurst 12 Hour victory and added this race to the Dubai 24 Hour victory for Schneider and the AMG Customer Sports program. They ended the dramatic race with a lead well over a lap on the second and third placed cars. Roloff had the honour to take the chequered flag surviving the mixed conditions without radio contact to the team. The team struggled in that year's Australian GT season, with Jack Le Brocq only managing ninth in the points. In 2014, the team finished third in the Bathurst 12 Hour, with Greg Crick, Will Davison and Jack Le Brocq behind the wheel. Their other entry, driven by Maro Engel, set pole position and in doing so won the first Allan Simonsen Pole Position Trophy. In the 2014 Australian GT Championship, Erebus won the title with Richard Muscat driving.

Forming Gibraltar Reservoir, the dam is owned by the city of Santa Barbara. Originally constructed in 1920 and expanded in 1948, the dam and reservoir are located in a remote part of the Los Padres National Forest. The main purpose of Gibraltar Dam is domestic water supply. It provides about of water to Santa Barbara each year, supplying almost 30% of the city's needs. Water diverted from the dam also powers a small hydroelectric plant. Due to having lost a massive portion of its capacity to sediment build-up, the lake can often fill and spill after a single storm, while drying up completely in some years. As of February 2019, sedimentation has reduced the reservoir's capacity to , only 19% of its designed capacity. The dam is built in a part of the Santa Ynez River called the \\"Gibraltar Narrows\\" that gave its name to the Gibraltar (or Sunbird) mercury mine, which operated next to what is now Gibraltar Reservoir between the 1870s and 1990s. Description Gibraltar Dam is a constant radius concrete arch dam high and long. The dam is located about from the mouth of the Santa Ynez River and just above the confluence of Devils Canyon with the river. The dam controls runoff from a drainage basin of with an annual inflow of . The Santa Ynez basin upstream is mostly wilderness and inflows are unregulated with the exception of the smaller Juncal Dam (owned by the Montecito Water District). Downstream of Gibraltar, the Santa Ynez flows into the much larger Lake Cachuma, owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. The concrete spillway extends southward from the main dam and is controlled by four manually operated radial gates. Flashboards can be installed atop the gates during the non-flood season to increase the reservoir capacity. The spillway capacity is about . The spillway is designed so that overflow water cascades down the natural sandstone face adjacent to the dam, creating a high waterfall. The original design capacity of Gibraltar Reservoir was . After its 1948 expansion the gross capacity was increased to , though so much sediment had already accumulated that the usable capacity was still only about . Since then, the dam has not been raised nor any sediment dredged from the reservoir, and it has gradually declined to a third of its original capacity. As of February 2019, sedimentation has reduced the reservoir's capacity to , or only 19% of its designed capacity. Water is drawn from the reservoir via an intake structure near the south end of the dam into the Mission Tunnel, which transports water beneath the Santa Ynez Mountains to a small regulation basin, Lauro Reservoir. The water is either treated at the Cater Water Treatment Plant before entering the city's distribution system, or released into Mission Creek for groundwater recharge. The Mission Tunnel has a diversion capacity of . At the end of the Mission Tunnel is the 820 kilowatt Lauro hydroelectric plant, which was initially constructed in 1985 but was idled in 1998 due to increasing costs. The city repaired and recommissioned the plant in 2015 after the cost of federal licensing decreased, but drought prevented the plant from actually running until early 2017. Background and construction The Santa Ynez River at Gibraltar dam site, before damming. In the early 1900s the City of Santa Barbara had exhausted its local water supplies, and looked to the drainage basin of the nearby Santa Ynez River, which is much larger than any of the city's local streams. In 1904 construction began on the Mission Tunnel which was bored under Mission Canyon in the Santa Ynez Mountains, to tap surface and ground water in the Santa Ynez basin. At that time, it was the longest water tunnel in the world. The city sought to build a dam somewhere on the Santa Ynez River in order to increase the water supply available for Mission Tunnel. Between 1913 and 1919, revenue bonds totaling $820,000 were issued for the construction of the dam and water system. Several dam sites were considered including the Mono Creek, Juncal and Main River sites, but all were dropped in favor of Gibraltar, which offered the largest storage capacity and highest available run-off as well as the most geologically favorable dam site. Rock-fill, masonry and concrete designs were all studied. The Mission Tunnel was extended to the Gibraltar dam site, which would ultimately allow water to flow by gravity to Santa Barbara. Site preparation work began in 1913 with the placement of foundations in the riverbed, for which a $40,000 contract was awarded to Arthur S. Bent Construction Co. In 1917 a concrete \\"thrust block\\" was poured on the south side of the canyon to take the weight of the future dam, as the rock on this side was not high enough to support the structure. The contract for the dam itself was let to Bent Brothers and W.A. Kraner on July 8, 1918. Because there was no road to the site, workers and supplies were transported via an gauge, 220-volt electric railway inside the Mission Tunnel, which was only high and wide. This also limited the size of the equipment used at the site, such as a steam shovel, concrete mixers and rock crushers, which had to be disassembled and moved through the tunnel piece by piece. Up to three trains were operated at once, with a passing siding in the middle of the tunnel allowing for one trainload of supplies to be delivered every half-hour. Hazardous materials such as dynamite were not allowed inside the tunnel and had to be packed over the Santa Ynez Mountains on a primitive trail. The work was made even more difficult by the constant leakage of groundwater into the tunnel which formed \\"a continuous downpour from the roof in many places\\" and special care had to be taken to prevent contamination, since this water ultimately flowed into Santa Barbara's municipal supply. After the numerous logistics problems were worked out, construction of the dam proceeded at a rapid pace with poured in the first three months of work. To allow normal river flows to pass through the dam during construction, a hole was left in the bottom of the dam. A total of 270,000 sacks of cement and 400,000 board feet of lumber were hauled through the tunnel during construction. Aggregate used for concrete making was mined from the river bed and processed at a crushing/screening plant located about upstream from the dam. The mixed concrete was then placed on the dam via a cableway system anchored by a steel tower. During the winter of 1918-1919 construction had to halt for three months due to the risk of flooding in the river-bottom gravel mining areas. The dam was initially built to a height of above the stream bed, and above bedrock. When completed on January 23, 1920, Gibraltar became the first dam to impound the Santa Ynez River. Due to the extremely inaccessible location of the dam, construction ended up costing nearly $2,000,000. According to the Engineering News-Record (1920) \\"at no place on the dam is variation from true line greater than one inch.\\" The hole in the base of the dam was closed by a temporary valve before being concreted in from downstream, allowing the reservoir to begin filling. Although the dam itself was now complete, there was a lack of funds to finish the spillway. The winter of 1920-21 was dry and the new reservoir failed to fill, forcing the city to use limited groundwater supplies. Heavy rains in January and February 1922 filled and overflowed the reservoir for the first time. Flooding heavily damaged the temporary spillway, and erosion along a previously unknown fault zone beneath the spillway nearly led to its collapse. The structure was rebuilt at a cost of $90,000. Gin Chow v. Santa Barbara In 1928 Gin Chow, who owned a farm on the Santa Ynez River, sued the city of Santa Barbara challenging its right to divert water from Gibraltar Reservoir, and soon 39 other farmers in the Santa Ynez Valley signed on to the case. Chow's demand was based upon the doctrine of riparian water rights in which existing landowners along a river have the right to the full, unimpaired flow of the stream through their property regardless of how or whether they use it. Riparian rights had been challenged by a controversial state amendment passed that year, which provided that \\"the water resources of the State be put to beneficial use\\" and that \\"the right to water... does not and shall not extend to the waste or unreasonable use... of water\\" and the Gin Chow case was the first serious legal test of the amendment. Five years later Gin S. Chow v. Santa Barbara was settled in the California Supreme Court in favor of the city. The court determined that \\"the waters to be impounded and taken by the defendants are extraordinary storm waters of the river and not a part of the usual and customary flow of the stream\\" ‚Äì essentially, the diversion did not have a negative effect on downstream landowners since these floodwaters would have flowed into the ocean anyway. The Gin Chow decision allowed the city to divert up to per year from Gibraltar Dam as a \\"prescriptive right\\", but also required the city to release at least during the late summer and fall when the natural river flow is lowest. In addition, the city is allowed to take \\"an additional amount of storm runoff resulting from torrential rains.\\" These rules continue to govern the operation of the dam today. Gin Chow is considered a landmark case in the development of California water law, as it upheld the 1928 amendment, reducing riparian landowners' legal power over the state's water resources. This enabled more parties, such as the city of Santa Barbara, to file claims on surface water as long as the concept of \\"reasonable use\\" was observed. The court also emphasized that \\"what is such reasonable use is a question of fact, and depends upon the circumstances appearing in each particular case\\" and that \\"it requires no extraordinary foresight to envision the great and increasing population of the state... dependent upon stored water ‚Äì water that is now wasted into the sea and lost to any beneficial use. This is considered to have set a legal precedent for the state of California to build more dams. Expansion projects Immediately after its construction, the reservoir began to suffer from heavy sedimentation, a problem made worse by occasional wildfires in upstream areas. In 1932-33 wildfires burned some of the drainage basin, and in response to the increased erosion the U.S. Forest Service constructed two debris dams upstream to hold back sediment washed off the burned landscape. The Mono Debris Dam, an Ambursen-type structure, was built in 1936 and had completely filled with 1 million yd3 (770,000 m3) of sediment by 1938. The concrete-arch Agua Caliente Debris Dam was completed in late 1937 and by 1941 had filled with 750,000 yd3 (570,000 m3) of sediment. Despite the scale of these conservation projects, they only extended Gibraltar's useful life by a few years. The flood of March 1938 was a major contributor to the large volume of debris run-off and caused $340,000 of damage downstream in the Lompoc area. By 1948, sediment had filled half of Gibraltar reservoir. Compounding the problem, severe drought struck in the winter of 1947-48, and the remaining water was soon sucked dry and an emergency water rationing ordinance was enacted. In summer 1948 the dam was raised and a new buttressed spillway section added. This restored the reservoir to a capacity of when it filled the next winter. Enlarging the dam cost $1.1 million, which was again paid by bonds issued by the city of Santa Barbara. However, the expanded reservoir continued filling with sediment faster than expected. Without enough storage capacity the reservoir has been subject to more frequent spills, depriving the city of water it otherwise could have used. This was a major factor behind the construction of Bradbury Dam by the federal government in 1953 to store more Santa Ynez River water in Lake Cachuma, about downstream of Gibraltar Dam. After a seismic evaluation in 1983, Gibraltar Dam was rehabilitated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after it was found at risk of failure from a strong earthquake. A buttress of roller-compacted concrete was laid against the downstream face. Although the project added no new storage capacity to the dam, it was designed to support a increase in height should that be needed in the future. The work was carried out from October to December 1990 and involved placing of concrete. This essentially changed the dam from a pure arch to an arch-gravity structure. The entire cost of the project was $8.18 million. \\"Pass-through\\" operation and future plans right In the early 1980s the city of Santa Barbara once again expressed interest in raising the dam. However, the California Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation determined that further enlargement of Gibraltar Dam would have an adverse effect on water flowing downstream into the Lake Cachuma reservoir. In 1989 the Upper Santa Ynez River Operations Agreement or \\"Pass Through Agreement\\" was developed in which some water spilled from Gibraltar Dam can be legally stored in Lake Cachuma for the city's use, thus eliminating the need to raise Gibraltar. In 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated the annual sediment inflow rate at or about 1.3 percent of its original design capacity per year. In the 21st century the reservoir has also been frequently at a low level, due both to persistent drought conditions and high water demand. In 2016 the reservoir dried up so completely that water had to be trucked to the dam keeper. As of 2017, there were no plans to remove sediment from the reservoir or to mitigate its inflow. The 1989 Pass Through Agreement was designed under the assumption that, once Gibraltar reservoir is nearly full of sediment, it will be operated as a run- of-the-river project (serving only to divert water) with most of its storage functions transferred to Lake Cachuma. However, the Bureau of Reclamation predicts that the reservoir will not completely fill with mud; it will stabilize at about of water volume due to the \\"flushing action of high flows\\" and that this level will be reached around 2031. Environmental issues Map showing potential steelhead spawning habitat in the Santa Ynez watershed. Gibraltar Dam (lower right) completely blocks fish migration to the river's headwaters, including Mono and Agua Caliente Creeks. Gibraltar Dam completely blocked migrating steelhead to the upper third of the Santa Ynez River when completed in 1920. This was despite a 1916 suggestion of the California Fish and Game Commission that a fish ladder be constructed with the dam; no such structure was ever built. The dam \\"altered downstream hydrology, sediment transport, stream habitat, [and] water quality\\" and also delayed steelhead migration during the early rainy season by holding back floodwaters that otherwise might have breached the sandbar at the mouth of the river. No reliable estimates have been made of the steelhead population prior to Gibraltar's construction; however, it is believed to have been much greater. The dam did not appear to have a large impact on downstream steelhead populations; in 1946 a group of fisheries biologists described steelhead habitat between Solvang and Gibraltar Dam as \\"excellent\\". Steelhead migration to the base of Gibraltar Dam ended with the completion of Bradbury Dam in 1953. In 2004 it was proposed to trap adult steelhead below Bradbury Dam and truck them to the river above Gibraltar Dam so they could be allowed to complete their natural migration, but this plan was not implemented. Despite the fragmentation of certain aquatic habitats, the dam has also inadvertently created new riparian habitat along the Santa Ynez River as the upstream end of Gibraltar Reservoir gradually fills in with sediment. A wide floodplain with a well defined stream channel was created, and is now home to typical California riparian woodland (willow, cottonwood and oak). This has provided habitat for endangered species such as the least Bell's vireo. The 2007 Zaca Fire burned much of the upper Santa Ynez watershed, causing huge amounts of ash-laden silt to flow into Gibraltar Reservoir. Organic material in the ash reacted with chlorine disinfectant in Santa Barbara's water supply to form carcinogenic compounds. Cleaning up the water cost the city nearly $3 million. Other more recent fires have also impacted the Gibraltar watershed, such as the 2016 Rey Fire and the 2017 Thomas Fire. There have been concerns of mercury contamination at the reservoir due to the proximity of the old Gibraltar Mine (Sunbird Mine) which ceased operations in 1991. However, no evidence of mercury has been found in the reservoir, and there have been no cases of mercury poisoning in Santa Barbara County connected with the mine site. Public access Although the dam and reservoir are open to the public, only official vehicles are allowed on the narrow winding dirt roads leading to the dam. The shortest way to reach the dam on foot is a round trip hike along the Santa Ynez River from Red Rock Campground. It can also be reached from several trails originating at Camino Cielo Road. The Gibraltar Trail follows the southern edge of the reservoir from the dam, and several other trails branch around the reservoir into the backcountry of Los Padres National Forest. Boating, fishing and swimming are not allowed at the reservoir since it is a public water supply.

See List of leaders of Russia for the continuation of leadership. History Regalia of the Emperor The title of the Emperor of All Russia was introduced for Peter the Great. After the victory at the Great Northern War and signing the Treaty of Nystad, in September 1721 Senate and Synod decided to award Peter with the title of the Emperor of All Russia with the following statement: \\"in the manner of the Roman Senate for the noble cause of emperors such titles publicly given them as a gift and into statues for the everlasting generations inscribed\\". On November 2, 1721 Peter I accepted the title. The Dutch Republic and Kingdom of Prussia immediately recognized the new title of the Russian Tsar, followed by the Kingdom of Sweden in 1723, the Ottoman Empire in 1739, the United Kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire in 1742, the Kingdom of France and the Spain in 1745, and finally the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1764. Since then the Russian State was referred to as the Russian Empire. On February 16, 1722 Peter I issued the Decree of Succession by which he abolished the old custom of passing the throne to the direct descendants in the male line, but allowed the appointment of an heir through any decent person, at the will of the monarch. Coronation ceremony Coronations in the Russian Empire involved a highly developed religious ceremony in which the Emperor was crowned and invested with regalia, then anointed with chrism and formally blessed by the church to commence his reign. Although rulers of Muscovy had been crowned prior to the reign of Ivan III, their coronation rituals assumed overt Byzantine overtones as the result of the influence of Ivan's wife Sophia Paleologue, and the imperial ambitions of his grandson, Ivan IV.Muscovy, Sections \\"The Evolution of the Russian Aristocracy\\" and \\"Ivan IV\\". For crownings of earlier rulers of Muscovy, see Alfred Rambaugh Rambaud on the Rise of the Grand Princes of Moscow . The modern coronation, introducing \\"European-style\\" elements, replaced the previous \\"crowning\\" ceremony and was first used for Catherine I in 1724.Scenarios of Power.

See also Moscow Becomes the Third Rome. the Russian rite was designed to link its rulers and prerogatives to those of the so-called \\"Second Rome\\" (Constantinople).Wortman, pg. 10. A political theory prevalent amongst many Orthodox Russians into the twentieth century postulated that there were three \\"Romes\\": the first (Rome) had allegedly apostatized from true Christianity after the Great Schism of 1054 between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy; the second (Constantinople) had equally apostatized by accepting Roman Catholicism at the Council of Florence and had subsequently fallen to the Turks; Moscow and \\"Holy Russia\\" were the third Rome, and (according to this doctrine) \\"a fourth there shall never be\\". A History of Russia, Chapter 1: Medieval Russia, Section \\"Ivan the Great\\". While months or even years could pass between the initial accession of the sovereign and the performance of this ritual, church policy held that the monarch must be anointed and crowned according to the Orthodox rite to have a successful tenure.New York Times, May 31, 1896. Quoted in Wortman, Introduction. See also Blech, Annalise, The Russian Orthodox Church: History and Influence, University of Texas at Austin, 2008, pg. 9. As the church and state were essentially one in Imperial Russia, this service invested the Tsars with political legitimacy; however, this was not its only intent. It was equally perceived as conferring a genuine spiritual benefit that mystically wedded sovereign to subjects, bestowing divine authority upon the new ruler. As such, it was similar in purpose to other European coronation ceremonies from the medieval era. Even when the imperial capital was located at St. Petersburg (1713‚Äì1728, 1732‚Äì1917), Russian coronations were always held in Moscow at the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Kremlin. The last coronation service in Russia was held on 26 May 1896 for Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, who would be the final Tsar and Tsaritsa of Russia. The Russian Imperial regalia survived the subsequent Russian Revolution and the Communist period, and are currently on exhibit in a museum at the Kremlin Armoury.

His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres. Influences for Michael Jackson Jackson's music took by storm in R&B;, pop and soul. He had been influenced by the work of contemporary musicians such as James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Three Dog Night, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis, Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, The Isley Brothers, the Bee Gees, and the West Side Story dancers. According to David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, (which was also Jackson's first solo debut outside of The Jackson 5), Jackson watched West Side Story almost every week and it was his favorite film. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was Jackson's greatest inspiration. In reference to Brown, Jackson declared: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\" The young Michael Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He later expressed: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang ‚Äì just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\"Taraborrelli, p. 60 But Jackson owed part of his enduring style‚Äîespecially his use of the oooh interjection‚Äîto Ross. From a young age, Jackson often punctuated his verses with a sudden exclamation of oooh. Diana Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with The Supremes.

He was a Liberal Party member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1976 to 1980, representing the electorate of Lockyer. A long-term Toowoomba councillor, he later served as Mayor of Toowoomba from 1997 to 2000. Bourke was born in the Brisbane suburb of Nundah, and was educated at St Patrick's College in Shorncliffe and the University of Queensland. A pharmacist outside politics, he worked in Brisbane from 1959 to 1966 and in London from 1966 to 1969, before settling in Toowoomba in 1970. He bought and operated a pharmacy in Margaret Street, and was elected as a City of Toowoomba alderman in 1976. State politics In 1976, Gordon Chalk, the state Liberal leader since 1965, retired from politics mid-term, causing a by-election in his seat of Lockyer. Bourke was selected as the Liberal candidate to succeed him, but faced a strong challenge from National Party candidate Neville Adermann, son of former federal minister Charles Adermann. The National Party, though in coalition with the Liberal Party, had long held claim to Lockyer, but were reluctant to oppose Chalk; on his retirement, they had nominated a candidate. The campaign was bitter and saw the National Party target the seat with significant resources, but Bourke won 40% of the primary vote and won the seat on preferences. Bourke was re-elected at the 1977 state election, and served as secretary to the joint government parties from April 1979 until November 1980. Tensions between the two parties had grown towards the end of that term, and at the 1980 election, he faced another strong challenge from the National Party; he would go on to lose to their candidate, farmer Tony FitzGerald. Bourke had sold his pharmacy business upon his election to parliament, and worked as a real estate agent for Rogers and Joseph after his election defeat. He opened his own pharmacy again in 1984 in Bridge Street. He had remained an alderman through his time in state politics, and subsequently served as deputy mayor under Clive Berghofer for six years, leaving the council in 1988. Mayor of Toowoomba Bourke returned to local politics in 1997, when he was elected Mayor of Toowoomba, having received a high-profile late endorsement from Berghofer. He pursued a policy of fiscal restraint as mayor, and touted among his successes as mayor the completion of an aquatic centre, water treatment plant, and securing a deal to sell sewerage effluent to the Millmerran Power Station. He had an acrimonious relationship with the local media, and had received criticism for a perception of an 'abrasive' attitude towards ratepayers and council staff. He was reportedly the subject of a Criminal Justice Commission inquiry into complaints of verbal harassment of council staff in 1999, but maintained there had never been a complaint lodged against him. He also had a highly publicised falling out with the city's chief executive officer, who subsequently resigned after an extended period on stress leave. He ran for re-election in 2001, but was defeated by alderman Di Thorley. He considered running as an independent for the federal seat of Groom at the 2001 election, but this did not eventuate. He sold his pharmacy business in 2002, and thereafter worked as a locum pharmacist in the Toowoomba area. He later contested the 2008 council elections for the new Toowoomba Regional Council, but was unsuccessful.

In the battle, three divisions of a First French Republic army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte attacked several columns of the retreating Habsburg Austrian army led by Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen. In three days of confused fighting, French divisions directed by Andr√© Mass√©na, Jean Joseph Guieu, and Jean-Mathieu-Philibert S√©rurier succeeded in blocking the Tarvis Pass and capturing 3,500 Austrians led by Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza. The engagement occurred during the War of the First Coalition, part of the French Revolutionary Wars. After Bonaparte's capture of the fortress of Mantua in early February 1797, he cleared his south flank by crushing the army of the Papal States. Reinforced with forces from the Rhine front, Bonaparte was determined to drive the Austrian army from northeast Italy. His offensive began in March and consisted of a secondary drive through the County of Tyrol by Barth√©lemy Catherine Joubert's left wing and an eastward thrust by Bonaparte's main army. The main French army soon drove the archduke's forces into headlong retreat while Joubert battled with Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen in the Tyrol. Charles tried to hold the Tarvis Pass against the French by sending three columns of reinforcements, but they found the pass held by Mass√©na's French forces. While many Austrian troops fought their way out, the last column was trapped between three converging French divisions and compelled to surrender. A subsequent advance brought the French within of the Austrian capital of Vienna. In mid-April, Bonaparte proposed and the Austrians agreed to the Preliminaries of Leoben. Most of the terms were ratified by the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797, ending the long war. Background =Fall of Mantua= On 2 February 1797, the Siege of Mantua ended when Feldmarschall Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser surrendered the fortress of Mantua. In recognition of his doughty defense, Wurmser, his staff, and an escort of 700 soldiers were allowed free passage to Austrian lines. An additional 20,000 Austrians were paroled on the promise that they would not fight against France until exchanged. The siege cost the garrison 16,333 killed, wounded, or died of disease. The French captured 325 artillery pieces in Mantua and recovered 179 of their own guns that were lost earlier in the siege.Smith (1998), 132-133 General of Division Napoleon Bonaparte was not present for the capitulation, having left a few days earlier to press the war against the Papal States. Following instructions from Bonaparte, General of Division Jean-Mathieu-Philibert S√©rurier refused to amend the initial French surrender proposals. At length, Wurmser acquiesced and accepted Bonaparte's terms. Columns of disarmed Austrians marched out of Mantua on 4, 5, and 6 February.Boycott-Brown (2001), 521-522 =French offensive= Meanwhile, important events were taking place elsewhere. On 3 February, a 9,000-man French column under General of Division Claude Perrin Victor crushed a 7,000-strong Papal States force led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi in the Battle of Faenza (Battle of Castel Bolognese). For the loss of only 100 men, the French inflicted 800 killed and wounded on their enemies and captured 1,200 soldiers, 14 guns, 8 colors, and 8 caissons. On 9 February, the 1,200-man Papal States garrison of Ancona surrendered to Victor. Bonaparte soon forced the Pope to agree to the Treaty of Tolentino, compelling the Papal States to disgorge 30 million francs.Chandler (1966), 121 Napoleon Bonaparte During 1796, the campaign in Germany had received priority in terms of French troop reinforcements. But after a significant lack of success in the Rhine theater, the French government in Paris belatedly decided to send reinforcements to Italy. Generals of Division Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte and Antoine Guillaume Delmas were transferred to the Italian front with their troops. Although the new Austrian commander in Italy, Feldmarschall Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen had 50,000 troops, they were distributed over a wide front. Bonaparte was determined to attack Charles before the Austrians were ready. Having 60,000 men available, Bonaparte planned to attack through Friuli with two-thirds of these troops. The French commander posted General of Division Barth√©lemy Joubert with about 20,000 troops to protect the Tyrol against a possible Austrian attack in that quarter. If no threat developed, Joubert was ordered to rendezvous with Bonaparte in the Drava River valley.Chandler (1966), 122 With General of Division Pierre Augereau on leave, General of Division Jean Joseph Guieu assumed command of his division. Generals of Division Andr√© Mass√©na, Bernadotte, and S√©rurier also marched with Bonaparte's main body. At the end of February, the French advance began with he crossing of the Brenta River. The weather enforced a suspension of operations, but on 10 March, the French drove forward again in two columns. Bonaparte took 32,000 troops through Sacile, aiming for Valvasone. Guarding the left flank were Mass√©na and 11,000 more men. Charles deployed his main force between Spilimbergo and San Vito al Tagliamento. On the 14th, Mass√©na clashed with a small force of Austrians under General-major Franz Joseph, Marquis de Lusignan.Chandler (1966), 123 On 16 February 1797, the divisions of Guieu and Bernadotte attacked across the Tagliamento River under cover of artillery fire. In the Battle of Valvasone, the French inflicted 700 casualties on their foes and captured six guns. The next day, Bernadotte scored a coup at Gradisca d'Isonzo when he cut off and forced a 2,500-man enemy column to surrender. Three battalions of the Hoch und Deutschmeister Infantry Regiment Nr. 4, one battalion of the Spl√©nyi Infantry Regiment Nr. 51, 10 guns, and 8 colors fell into French hands.Smith (1998), 133-134 Meanwhile, about to the west, Joubert and 18,000 men clashed with Feldmarschall-Leutnant Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen's 12,000 troops on 20 March at St. Michael,Sargent (1895), 140 near present-day Salorno, Italy. Kerpen's Austrian force included five battalions in two regular infantry regiments plus elements of a third, three squadrons of dragoons, and 5,000 Tyrolese militia. In the battle, Joubert's troops routed their opponents inflicting losses of 300 killed and wounded plus 3,500 captured, while suffering 200 French killed and wounded. Battle Andr√© Mass√©na played a key role in trapping the Austrians. As Mass√©na pushed toward Tarvisio (Tarvis), driving Lusignan before him, the Archduke sent three divisions to hold the pass. However, as they arrived in the vicinity the Austrians found themselves caught between Mass√©na and Bonaparte's other divisions which operated against their rear. In the first clash on 21 March, Mass√©na's advance guard pushed General-major Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko's Austrians out of Tarvis, blocking the escape route. Later that day, General-major Charles Philippe Vinchant de Gontroeul appeared with another column and drove the French from Tarvis. Mass√©na launched a heavy assault on the 22nd, dispossessing Gontroeul of the town and forcing him to withdraw toward Villach.Smith & Kudrna, K√∂bl√∂s de Nagy-Var√°d, Samuel This left Feldmarschall-Leutnant Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza's Austrian column on the wrong side of the pass. Bajalics and General-major Samuel K√∂bl√∂s de Nagy-Var√°d battled on 22 March against the divisions of Mass√©na, Guieu, and S√©rurier. The next day they surrendered 4,000 Austrian soldiers, 25 artillery pieces, and 500 wagons. According to another source, the French captured 3,500 Austrians, 25 guns, and 400 vehicles. In the different clashes, the French suffered 1,200 casualties while inflicting a loss of 1,000 killed and wounded on their opponents.Smith (1998), 133-134 The 3rd Battalion of the Klebek Infantry Regiment Nr. 14, 4th Battalion of the Archduke Anton Infantry Regiment Nr. 52, and Khevenh√ºller Grenadier Battalion were captured. Other Austrian units involved in the fighting were two battalions of the F√ºrstenburg Infantry Regiment Nr. 36, three battalions of the Nad√°sdy Infantry Regiment Nr. 39, R√ºdt Grenadier Battalion, four squadrons of the Erd√∂dy Hussar Regiment Nr. 11, and one squadron of the Toscana Dragoon Regiment Nr. 26. Aftermath Archduke Charles proved unable to stop Bonaparte's offensive. While Bernadotte pursued the part of Charles' army that retreated toward Ljubljana (Laybach), General of Division Charles Dugua occupied the port of Trieste with a cavalry column. With his supply line lengthening, Bonaparte created a new center of operations at Palmanova. To prevent his strategic left flank from being molested, Bonaparte ordered Joubert to secure Brixen. At this time General of Division Louis Fran√ßois Jean Chabot took over the division of S√©rurier, who was ill. On 29 March, divisions of Mass√©na, Guieu, and Chabot captured Klagenfurt.Chandler (1966), 124 With too few troops available for an offensive, Bonaparte changed his center of operations to Klagenfurt and ordered the independent columns of Joubert, Bernadotte, and Victor (from the Papal States) to join him there. General of Brigade Louis Friant was assigned to hold Trieste with 1,500 soldiers. On 31 March Bonaparte sent a letter to Archduke Charles asking for an armistice. He hoped that this would gain time for General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau's offensive in Germany to get started. To bluff Charles into thinking the French were in great strength, Bonaparte drove his men forward. On 7 April they seized Leoben, only from Vienna. On that day the Austrians agreed to a five-day suspension of hostilities. After securing an additional five-day truce on the 13th, Bonaparte proposed the start of negotiations on 16 April, even though he had no authority to do so. Aware that the French were on the brink of launching an offensive on the Rhine, the Austrians signed the Preliminaries of Leoben on the 18th. Most of the terms of this agreement were confirmed by the Treaty of Campo Formio on 17 October 1797.Chandler (1966), 125 The armistice was followed by pointless fighting on the Rhine. On the 18th, a French army under General of Division Lazare Hoche defeated Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz von Werneck's forces at the Battle of Neuwied. Moreau's army finally lurched into action on 20 and 21 April when it drove back the troops of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Anton Count Szt√°ray de Nagy-Mihaly in the Battle of Diersheim.Smith (1998), 134-135 During the fighting at Tarvis, Joubert's column continued to advance. The French general repulsed an attack by General-major Johann Ludwig Alexius von Loudon at Neumarkt on 21 March. Dropping off Delmas' 5,000-man division to guard his supply line, Joubert pressed forward to Klausen where he again defeated Kerpen on the 22nd. The Austrian retreated northeast to Mittenwald where he was beaten again on 28 March and pushed out of Sterzing. With the Tyrolese militia turning out in droves to fight the French invaders, Joubert was compelled to fall back to Brixen. On 31 March, Kerpen attacked the French at Brixen but was unable to dislodge them. After being reinforced to 12,000 men by the arrival of Laudon's brigade, Kerpen again assaulted Brixen on 2 April without success. Nevertheless, under continuing pressure, Delmas withdrew from Bolzano (Bozen) on 4 April. The next day, Joubert set out for Villach and the appointed junction with Bonaparte. After continuous skirmishing with the Tyroleans, his column reached there on 8 May, well after the Leoben agreement. During Joubert's campaign French losses may have reached as high as 8,000 men.Smith & Kudrna, Kerpen, Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Notes References  Battles involving France Battles involving Austria Battles of the French Revolutionary Wars Battles of the War of the First Coalition Battles in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Conflicts in 1797 1797 in Italy ","title":"Battle of Tarvis (1797)"},{"id":"37056736","text":"Roundtop is a hill in northwestern York County, Pennsylvania, with a summit elevation of .Mountainzone.com The resort Ski Roundtop is there.

At the time, the show was the most ambitious Shakespearean television adaptation ever made, and was a critical and commercial success in both the UK and the US. Introduction The concept for the series originated in 1959 with Peter Dews, a veteran BBC producer and director, who was inspired by a 1951 Anthony Quayle directed production of the Henriad at the Theatre Royal and a 1953 Douglas Seale directed repertory cast production of the three parts of Henry VI at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and subsequently, The Old Vic. At the time, An Age of Kings was the most conceptually ambitious Shakespeare project ever undertaken, containing over 600 speaking roles, and requiring thirty weeks of rehearsal prior to performance. Each episode cost roughly ¬£4,000. Adapter Eric Crozier cut the text of the eight plays into sixty-, seventy-, seventy-five- and eighty-minute episodes, which each episode roughly corresponding to half of each play. The only exception to this was 1 Henry VI, which was reduced to a single hour-long episode. Dews sourced most of his cast from The Old Vic, using many of the same actors who had appeared in Seale's production, although in different roles (Paul Daneman for example, played Henry VI for Seale, but played Richard III in Age of Kings). Dews also used actors with whom he had worked whilst directing undergraduate plays at Oxford University. He gave the job of directing to his assistant, Michael Hayes. The initial plan was for the series to be the inaugural production in the BBC's newly built BBC Television Centre in London, but when the studios opened, the series was not ready, and was instead broadcast from the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith. Peter Dews described the set as \\"a large permanent structure; platforms, steps, corridors, pillars, and gardens, which will house nearly all the plays' action and which will, despite its outward realism, be not very far from Shakespeare's \\"unworthy scaffold\\".\\"Quoted in The entire production was shot with four cameras running at any given time. For battle scenes, a cyclorama was used as a backdrop, obscured with smoke. Almost the entire series was shot in medium and close ups. All ten episodes were broadcast live, though a \\"telerecording\\" of the series was made. Many of the episodes ended with wordless pseudo-teasers for the following episode. For example, \\"The Deposing of the King\\" ends with a shot of Northumberland's dagger stabbed into Henry IV's paperwork, visually alluding to his later rebellion. \\"Signs of War\\" ends with a shot of a signpost reading \\"Agincourt\\", alluding to the upcoming battle in the following episode. \\"The Sun in Splendour\\" ends with George, Duke of Clarence almost falling into a vat of wine, only to be saved by his brother, Richard, who looks deviously at the camera and smiles, alluding to his subsequent murder. \\"The Dangerous Brother\\" ends with Richard watching the sleeping Princes in the Tower before smiling to himself and then blowing out a candle, again alluding to his planned murder. Head of BBC drama Michael Barry referred to these \\"teasers\\" by explaining that \\"a strengthened purpose is added to the narrative when it is wholly seen, and we are able to look forward to 'what happens next'.\\"Quoted in The series was a great success, with an average viewing audience of three million in the UK. The Times hailed the production as \\"monumental; a landmark in the BBC's Shakespearian tradition.\\"Quoted in The series won the British Guild of Directors' award for \\"Excellence in Directing\\" and the Peabody Award in the US. It led to a follow-up, The Spread of the Eagle, consisting of Shakespeare's Roman plays which did not prove as successful. =United States airing= After a run on the New York City independent commercial station WNEW beginning on January 10, 1961, the series was acquired for the United States public television network National Educational Television (NET) by the National Educational Television and Radio Center (NETRC), with financial support from the Humble Oil and Refining Company (the show was the first nationally distributed non-commercial series to receive support from a commercial source). Costing $250,000, Humble Oil not only paid for the national rights, but also for all publicity. NETRC promoted the show based on its educational value rather than its entertainment value, referring to it as \\"an experience in historical and cultural understanding,\\" and stating \\"insofar as we are able, cultural phenomena peculiar to the time and environment will be [...] explained, and significant themes will be explored wherever appropriate.\\" Frank C. Baxter provided commentary on the \\"historical, geographical and genealogical backgrounds of the plays.\\" First airing on 20 October 1961, on the 60 non-commercial TV stations then on the air, it proved a hit with both audiences and critics; the New York Herald Tribune called it \\"easily one of the most magnificent efforts of the TV season\\"; The New York Times wrote \\"whatever may be said of their ethics, those noblemen make for superb entertainment.\\" As public television's first smash hit, the series led to many other successful British drama imports. =Other countries= The series was also shown in several other countries, typically to a positive response. For example, in Australia, it was broadcast on ABC from October 1961, and was met with positive reviews. In Canada the series started October 1963. In West Germany, it was shown on WDR in 1967-1968. In the Netherlands, it was shown on NCRV from January 1966, again meeting with good reviews. The episodes =\\"Richard II: The Hollow Crown\\"= Sean Connery in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie (1964).

The most obvious difference is the complete removal of Talbot, the ostensible protagonist of the play. The characters of Burgundy and Edmund Mortimer have also been removed, and dialogue is heavily cut from every scene. All of the battle scenes from France have also been removed and the episode concentrates almost entirely on the political disintegration in England. * Patrick Garland as Duke of Bedford * John Ringham as Duke of Gloucester * Noel Johnson as Duke of Exeter * Robert Lang as Cardinal of Winchester * John Greenwood as Messenger * Terry Wale as Messenger * John Murray-Scott as Messenger * Jerome Willis as The Dauphin * Anthony Valentine as Duke of Alanson * John Warner as Regnier * David Andrews as Bastard of Orl√©ans * Eileen Atkins as Joan la Pucelle * Julian Glover as Warder * Jeremy Bisley as Warder * Timothy Harley as Servingman * Derek Ware as Servingman * Kenneth Farrington as Servingman * Leon Shepperdson as Woodvile * Michael Graham Cox as Lord Mayor * Jack May as Duke of York * Edgar Wreford as Earl of Suffolk * Alan Rowe as Duke of Somerset * Frank Windsor as Earl of Warwick * Tony Garnett as Vernon * John Greenwood as Lawyer * Terry Scully as King Henry the Sixth * Mary Morris as Margaret * Michael Graham Cox as Shepherd * Barbara Grimes as Dancer =\\"Henry VI: The Fall of a Protector\\"= Nan Marriott-Watson in 1922.

Having played the important role of Henry V's brother John, Duke of Bedford in the early episodes, Garland played the equally important role of Richard III's brother George, Duke of Clarence in later episodes. * First transmitted: 22 September 1960 * Running time: 60 minutes * Content: 2 Henry VI from Act 3, Scene 2 onwards (beginning with the murder of the Duke of Gloucester). * Alterations: the murder of Gloucester is shown, whereas in the text, it happens off-stage. The characters of both George Plantagenet and Edmund Plantagenet are introduced just prior to the First Battle of St Albans, whereas in the text, neither character is introduced until 3 Henry VI (Edmund in Act 1, Scene 3; George in Act 2, Scene 2). Additionally, Edmund is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child. Buckingham is killed on screen. In the text, his fate remains unknown until the opening lines of 3 Henry VI, where it is revealed he was killed by Edward. * John Ringham as Duke of Gloucester * Terence Lodge as Murderer * Adrian Brine as Murderer * Patrick Garland as Murderer * Edgar Wreford as Duke of Suffolk * Terry Scully as King Henry the Sixth * Mary Morris as Queen Margaret * Robert Lang as Cardinal Beaufort * Alan Rowe as Duke of Somerset * Frank Windsor as Earl of Warwick * Gordon Gostelow as Earl of Salisbury * John Murray-Scott as Vaux * David Andrews as A Sea-Captain * John Ringham as Master * Derek Ware as Master's Mate * John Greenwood as Gentleman * Jeremy Bisley as Gentleman * Adrian Brine as Walter Whitmore * Timothy Harley as George Bevis * Tony Garnett as John Holland * Esmond Knight as Jack Cade * Anthony Valentine as Dick the Butcher * Terence Lodge as Smith the Weaver * Terry Wale as The Clerk * Barry Jackson as Michael * Leon Shepperdson as Sir Humphrey Stafford * John Murray-Scott as Brother to Stafford * Kenneth Farrington as Duke of Buckingham * John Warner as Lord Say * John Greenwood as Messenger * Jeremy Bisley as Messenger * Derek Ware as Soldier * John Barcroft as Lord Clifford * Jerome Willis as Young Clifford * Jeffry Wickham as Alexander Iden * Jack May as Duke of York * Julian Glover as Edward * Patrick Garland as George * Paul Daneman as Richard * Terry Wale as Edmund =\\"Henry VI: The Morning's War\\"= * First transmitted: 6 October 1960 * Running time: 60 minutes * Content: 3 Henry VI Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scenes 1 and 2 (up to Richard's soliloquy wherein he vows to attain the crown). * Alterations: the character of Edmund, Earl of Rutland is played by an adult actor, whereas in the text, he is a child. Additionally, Margaret is present during his murder, and we see her wipe his blood on the handkerchief which she later gives to York; in the text, Margaret does not witness the murder. During the Battle of Towton, Richard fights and kills Clifford, whereas in the text, they fight, but Clifford flees and is mortally wounded off-stage when hit by an arrow. * Frank Windsor as Earl of Warwick * Jack May as Duke of York * Julian Glover as Edward IV * Patrick Garland as George, Duke of Clarence * Paul Daneman as Richard, Duke of Gloucester * Adrian Brine as Marquess of Montague * Jeffry Wickham as Duke of Norfolk * Terry Scully as King Henry the Sixth * Kenneth Farrington as Earl of Northumberland * Jerome Willis as Lord Clifford * Leon Shepperdson as Earl of Westmoreland * Terence Lodge as Duke of Exeter * Mary Morris as Queen Margaret * John Greenwood as Prince of Wales * Derek Ware as Gabriel * Anthony Valentine as Sir John Mortimer * Terry Wale as Rutland * John Murray-Scott as Messenger * Tony Garnett as Messenger * David Andrews as A Son * John Ringham as A Father * Timothy Harley as Sinklo * John Warner as Humphrey * Jane Wenham as Lady Elizabeth Grey * Jeremy Bisley as Nobleman =\\"Henry VI: The Sun in Splendour\\"= * First transmitted: 20 October 1960 * Running time: 60 minutes * Content: 3 Henry VI from Act 3, Scene 3 onwards (beginning with Margaret's visit to Louis XI of France). * Alterations: Edward is rescued from his imprisonment by Richard and Lord Stafford, whereas in the play, he is rescued by Richard, Lord Hastings and Lord Stanley. Warwick is killed during the Battle of Barnet by George, whereas in the text, he is carried onto stage mortally wounded by Edward. Also, the end of the episode differs slightly from the end of the play. After Edward expresses his wish that all conflict has ceased, a large celebration ensues. As the credits roll, Richard and George stand to one side, and George almost slips into a barrel of wine, only to be saved by Richard. As George walks away, Richard muses silently to himself and then smiles deviously at the camera. * John Warner as King Lewis XI * Tamara Hinchco as Lady Bona * Mary Morris as Queen Margaret * John Greenwood as Edward, Prince of Wales * Robert Lang as Earl of Oxford * Frank Windsor as Earl of Warwick * Anthony Valentine as Post * Paul Daneman as Richard, Duke of Gloucester * Patrick Garland as George, Duke of Clarence * Alan Rowe as Duke of Somerset * Julian Glover as King Edward the Fourth * Jane Wenham as Queen Elizabeth * John Ringham as Watchman * Timothy Harley as Watchman * Kenneth Farrington as Lord Rivers * David Andrews as Lord Hastings * Edgar Wreford as Lord Stafford * Derek Ware as Huntsman * Terry Scully as King Henry the Sixth * Gareth Tandy as Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond * John Murray-Scott as Messenger to King Henry * Jeffry Wickham as Mayor of York * Jerome Willis as Sir John Montgomery * Terry Wale as Soldier * Terence Lodge as Duke of Exeter * Timothy Harley as Messenger to Warwick * Jeremy Bisley as Messenger to Warwick * Tony Garnett as Sir John Somerville * Adrian Brine as Marquess of Montague * Leon Shepperdson as Messenger to Queen Margaret =\\"Richard III: The Dangerous Brother\\"= * First transmitted: 3 November 1960 * Running time: 60 minutes * Content: Richard III Acts 1, 2 and Act 3, Scene 1 (up to Richard promising Buckingham the Dukedom of Hereford). * Alterations: the character of Lord Grey is not portrayed as Queen Elizabeth's son, but simply as a kinsman; only Dorset is her son. In the text, although there is some confusion and overlapping regarding the two characters in the early scenes, in the latter half of the play, they are both depicted as her sons. As the closing credits roll, there is a scene of Richard watching the Princes sleeping; there is no such scene in the text. * Paul Daneman as Richard, Duke of Gloucester * Patrick Garland as George, Duke of Clarence * Frank Windsor as Brackenbury * David Andrews as Lord Hastings * Jill Dixon as Lady Anne * John Greenwood as A Gentleman * Terry Scully as King Henry VI * Kenneth Farrington as Earl Rivers * Leon Shepperdson as Lord Grey * Jane Wenham as Queen Elizabeth * Edgar Wreford as Duke of Buckingham * Jack May as Lord Stanley * Mary Morris as Queen Margaret * John Ringham as Catesby * Robert Lang as Murderer * Terry Wale as Murderer * Julian Glover as King Edward IV * Anthony Valentine as Marquess of Dorset * Alan Rowe as Ratcliff * Violet Carson as Duchess of York * Jeffry Wickham as Archbishop of York * Michael Lewis as Richard, Duke of York * Terence Lodge as Messenger * Hugh Janes as King Edward V * John Sharp as Lord Mayor * Jerome Willis as Cardinal Bourchier =\\"Richard III: The Boar Hunt\\"= Richard III was portrayed in An Age of Kings by Paul Daneman. In a 1953 production of the tetralogy at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre directed by Douglas Seale, Daneman had played one of Richard's royal predecessors, Henry V. * First transmitted: 17 November 1960 * Running time: 75 minutes * Content: Richard III from Act 3, Scene 1 onwards (beginning with Stanley's messenger arriving at Hastings' house). * Alterations: the scrivener's lamentation regarding the illegality of Hasting's execution is presented in the form of a plea as he attempts to convince two citizens to join him and speak out against Richard's actions; in the text, his speech is delivered as a soliloquy. The two priests between whom Richard stands as the Lord Mayor urges him to become King are not real priests, but two servants dressed up as priests. As Richard ascends to the throne for the first time, he stumbles, and has Buckingham help him into the chair; there is no such scene in the play. As in most filmed versions up this point (such as the 1912 The Life and Death of King Richard the Third and Laurence Olivier's 1955 Richard III), the ghosts appear only to Richard, whereas in the text they appear to both Richard and Richmond. * John Greenwood as A Messenger * David Andrews as Lord Hastings * John Ringham as Sir William Catesby * Jack May as Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby * Jeremy Bisley as A Priest * Edgar Wreford as Duke of Buckingham * Alan Rowe as Sir Richard Ratcliff * Kenneth Farrington as Earl Rivers * Leon Shepperdson as Lord Grey * Robert Lang as Sir Thomas Vaughan * Frank Pettingell as Bishop of Ely * Adrian Brine as Lord Lovell * Paul Daneman as King Richard the Third * John Sharp as Lord Mayor * Terry Wale as Scrivener * Violet Carson as Duchess of York * Jill Dixon as Queen Anne * Jane Wenham as Queen Elizabeth * Anthony Valentine as Marquess of Dorset * Frank Windsor as Sir Robert Brackenbury * Timothy Harley as A Page * Terence Lodge as Sir James Tyrell * Timothy Harley as Messenger * Derek Ware as Messenger * John Murray-Scott as Messenger * Terry Wale as Sir Christopher Urswick * Jerome Willis as Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond * Julian Glover as Earl of Oxford * Michael Wells as Sir Walter Herbert * Jeffry Wickham as Sir James Blount * Noel Johnson as Duke of Norfolk * Barry Jackson as Earl of Surrey * John Greenwood as Ghost of Prince Edward * Terry Scully as Ghost of King Henry the Sixth * Patrick Garland as Ghost of Clarence * Hugh Janes as Ghost of Ghost of King Edward the Fifth * Michael Lewis as Ghost of Richard of York See also * The Spread of the Eagle (1963) * The Wars of the Roses (1963; 1965) * BBC Television Shakespeare (1978-1985) * Shakespeare: The Animated Tales (1992-1994) * ShakespeaRe-Told (2005) * The Hollow Crown (2012; 2016) References External links * British Universities Film and Video Council An Age of Kings at Screenonline () * \\"The Television Revolution\\" () 1960 British television series debuts 1960 British television series endings 1960s British drama television series BBC television dramas BBC Television shows Black-and-white British television shows English-language television shows Films based on Henry IV (play) Films based on Henry V (play) Films based on Henry VI (play) Films based on Richard II (play) Films based on Richard III (play) Television shows based on plays Television series set in the 14th century Television series set in the 15th century ","title":"An Age of Kings"},{"id":"37056788","text":"Michael McPhail (born December 15, 1981) is an American rifle shooter.

National Portrait Gallery, London. The English composer Henry Purcell wrote funeral music that includes his Funeral Sentences and the later Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary, Z. 860\\\\. Two of the funeral sentences, Man that is born of a woman Z. 27 and In the midst of life we are in death Z. 17, survive in autograph score. The Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary comprises the March and Canzona Z. 780 and the funeral sentence Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts Z. 58C. It was first performed at the funeral of Queen Mary II of England in March 1695. Purcell's setting of Thou knowest, Lord was performed at his own funeral in November of the same year. In modern performances the march, canzona and three funeral sentences are often combined as Purcell's Funeral Sentences, Z. 860\\\\. History Queen Mary II died on 28 December 1694, but her funeral in Westminster Abbey was not until March 1695. Purcell composed a setting of the sixth of the seven sentences of the Anglican Burial Service (Thou Knowest Lord, Z. 58C) for the occasion, together with the March and Canzona (Z. 780). It is believed these were performed with settings of the other six sentences by the Elizabethan composer Thomas Morley. Purcell had much earlier composed settings of three of the Burial Service sentences, including two different ones of Thou Knowest Lord. The earlier settings are contained in autograph score, but there is no autograph of the 1695 music. Later in 1695 Purcell reused the March and Canzona as part of incidental music for Thomas Shadwell's play The Libertine. Text and instrumentation Autograph manuscript of the second Funeral Sentence, British Library The work is scored for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, four trumpets, and basso continuo. The text is from the Book of Common Prayer (1662): 1\\\\. Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and ne'er continueth in one stay. 2\\\\. In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. 3\\\\. Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears unto our pray'rs; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty. O holy and most merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee. Amen. Music The march, in C minor, was written for a quartet of flatt trumpets, which could play notes outside of the harmonic series and thus in a minor key. Following the march is the canzona, also in C minor. Thou Knowest Lord is in E flat major and is a stirring hymn-like setting with all the voice parts moving in the same rhythm. Purcell's earlier setting of the fourth sentence of the Burial Service, Man that is born of a woman, introduces a melancholy theme. Purcell brings tension to the phrase with hath but a short time to live, and the melody rises and falls with the words he cometh up and is cut down like a flower. With In the midst of life we are in death, an earlier setting of the fifth sentence, Purcell begins with a soprano part that is passed on to the choir. The music portrays with chromaticism an air of anguish. There are two earlier versions of Thou Knowest Lord.

He was known for treating high-profile patients and was often referred to in the media as a \\"Park Avenue psychiatrist\\". Among his more famous patients was F. Scott Fitzgerald. Career =Psychiatric practice= Although Hoffmann treated both rich and poor he became known for his high- profile patients and was often referred to in the media as a \\"Park Avenue psychiatrist\\". Hoffmann studied psychiatry in Vienna shortly after the turn of the century. He continued as a working psychiatrist into his seventies. In the 1940s, he was psychiatric advisor to the District Attorney of Nassau County. Among the more famous cases on which he consulted were the Creighton-Applegate poison case and the Lindbergh kidnapping. He was a frequent consultant on the stories of the day to the New York city media. Hoffmann's name was often spelled in media accounts of the day, without the double \\"n\\", as \\"Hoffman\\". During his work on Winter Carnival (film) in 1939, F. Scott Fitzgerald went on an alcoholic binge and was treated by Hoffmann.Robert Westbrook. Intimate Lies. Harper Collins 1995 pp 311-312. Hoffmann had met Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald in Paris in 1925. He admired Scott's writing, knew about his drinking, and said he would do what he could. One afternoon Sheilah Graham came into the room after a session and was dismayed to see that Scott had managed to reverse roles: He was listening to Dr. Hoffmann's problems and happily psychoanalyzing his psychiatrist. For two years Hoffmann treated underworld crime figure Frank Costello. The news media became aware that Hoffmann was treating Costello after Costello held fundraisers for the Salvation Army which included several judges among the invitees. Hoffmann admitted freely to the press that he was treating Costello and said he had advised the gangster to associate with a better class of people. Angered that Hoffmann had broken doctor-patient confidentiality by speaking publicly of his treatment, Costello severed their relationship saying it was actually he who had helped Hoffmann meet a better class of people. Once composer Richard Rodgers asked Hoffmann to visit his friend Lorenz Hart who was having problems with alcoholism and who had a strong aversion to being treated by psychiatrists. Hart was in the hospital at the time and Hoffmann said he would visit Hart in the guise of a hospital staff member. At some point, Hoffmann dropped the pretense and began asking Hart questions such as why he liked oversized chairs and offices and if he had a Napoleon complex. Hart rejected Hoffmann's offer of treatment, phoning Rogers to say, \\"Your witch-doctor was in to see me.\\" In 1952, Hoffmann was sued by Mrs. Mabel Ingalls, sister of Eleanor Morgan Safterlee, granddaughter of J.P. Morgan, who claimed Hoffmann and attorney Sol A. Rosenblatt manipulated the writing of her sister's will for personal gain. The case received national media attention when the Rosenblatt was wounded in a shooting by an unknown assailant during the course of the trial. The will had left the entire estate, estimated up to $200,000, to Rosenblatt. Media reported witnesses who said that before Safterlee died of cancer she told them she was willing her estate to Rosenblatt so he could ensure Hoffmann receive it. The witness said she was infatuated with Hoffmann, calling him \\"Dickie boy\\" and \\"darling Dick\\". However, another witness said she didn't want Hoffmann to receive it. note: article include photo of Hoffmann speaking with police. Hoffmann and Rosenblatt denied the charges and the presiding judge ruled there was no evidence of undue influence. In the 1960s, Hoffmann was President of the Institute for Human-Animal Relationship, an organization which promoted the psychological and therapeutic value of pets. In the 1960s, due to a series of setbacks Hoffmann fell on hard times. After the death of his son from alcoholism, accusations of his using undue influence on a patient for personal gain, his second wife having left him, and the loss of his Park Avenue house, his once-lucrative practice began to decline. He was eventually forced to move from an elegant Park Avenue office to a basement office on the East Side with only his loyal secretary remaining to assist his weakening memory. =Media work= Hoffmann, far right, as an original panelist from the premiere broadcast of the TV game show What's My Line? February 2, 1950In 1943, Hoffmann was on the radio program ‚Äò‚ÄòMediation Board‚Äô‚Äô. As a well known and respected psychiatrist, Hoffmann wrote blurbs or introductions to novels of a controversial nature. For example, pulp fiction novels to legitimize their sexual topics, such as with Theodore Pratt's novel Tormented dealing with nymphomania, or for more serious novels to avoid censorship issues such as with Ann Aldrich's lesbian novel We, Too, Must Love. note: in the afterword to the Feminist Press edition written by Stephanie Foote the blurb by Hoffmann being referred to is with the original edition. Hoffmann was a panelist on the TV game show What's My Line? appearing on three episodes early in the show's existence in 1950, including the series premiere on February 2. In 1950, Hoffmann hosted an ABC radio drama providing psychological analysis and insight into the criminal acts depicted. One journalist criticized Hoffmann for \\"trying to add a little respectability to these little melodramas\\" and \\"putting his own profession in disrepute\\". In 1954, he appeared in the film Violated as a psychiatrist. The film was described by journalist Dorothy Kilgallen as a ‚Äúlurid flicker‚Äù, Personal life Hoffmann was born to Dr. E. Franz Hoffmann, psychiatrist, and wife in 1887. Hoffmann graduated from Cornell University in 1908. He was married and divorced twice. His first marriage was to actress Janet Beecher in August, 1919. He had one son, Richard Jr., who was a decorated bombardier in World War II, but who died as a young man of alcoholism. His son was divorced in 1952 from Christine Dodge Cromwell and they had one son. Cromwell was an heiress to her grandfather, founder of Dodge motor company, and divorced by charging he was only interested in her money. A year later Hoffmann's son remarried to Judith Ann Dexter. Hoffmann was close friends with actor Charles Coburn. Hoffmann was ethnically Jewish, but was an atheist. When asked by a minister if he was an atheist Hoffmann replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in Him, but I sure hope He believes in me.‚Äù He died at age 80. note: the article by Bishop is a detailed summary of Hoffmann's life upon his death. Bishop and Hoffmann had a working and personal relationship. In 1942, Hoffmann's residence at 870 Park Avenue, NY was rebuilt in a \\"art moderne style\\" by prominent architect Ely Jacques Kahn. In 1946, after a traffic accident actress Gloria Swanson asked that she be taken to Dr. Hoffmann's home instead of the hospital. In the 1960s, Hoffmann divorced and lost his Park Avenue home which was one factor contributing to the decline of his career.

Smith at Veldhoven, the Netherlands A. O. Smith Corporation is an American manufacturer of both residential and commercial water heaters and boilers and the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America. It also supplies water treatment products in the Asian market. The company has 24 locations worldwide, including five manufacturing facilities in North America, as well as plants in Bengaluru in India, Nanjing in China and Veldhoven in The Netherlands. In the past, A. O. Smith has had numerous other product lines. Among them, it was the largest bomb maker in the United States by the end of World War I. Smith ranked 74th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.Peck, Merton J. & Scherer, Frederic M. The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis (1962) Harvard Business School p.619  History  The A.O. Smith Corporation was founded in 1874 by Charles Jeremiah Smith as C. J. Smith and Sons, a baby carriage and bicycle parts manufacturer. They began forming steel tubing from sheet metal to make bicycle frames. By 1895, the company was the largest bicycle parts manufacturer. In 1899, Arthur Oliver Smith, a son of the founder, developed the world‚Äôs first pressed steel vehicle frame and they later began making frames for the Peerless Automobile Company, Cadillac, and Ford Motor Company.Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production, pp. 79, 248-9, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, IN, 1945. In 1904, the company incorporated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as A. O. Smith Company. In 1913, Lloyd Raymond Smith took over, and in 1914, the company introduced the Smith Motor Wheel, a gasoline-powered device for bicycles and in 1915, they began manufacturing the Smith Flyer, which they later sold to Briggs & Stratton Company of Milwaukee. A year later in 1916, A.O. Smith was incorporated in New York, and in 1917, they began manufacturing bomb casings for World War I. In the 1920s, company engineers developed the coated welding rod which they used in manufacturing until 1965, as well as the world‚Äôs first fully automated automobile frame factory, with the capability of making a frame every eight seconds, until 1958, the first arc-welded, high-pressure vessel used to refine oil, which the company produced until 1963, and oil supply line pipes, until 1972. During the Great Depression, the company was said to have excluded Blacks from applying for employment in Milwaukee because \\"the company 'never did and didn't intend to employ Negroes.'\\" In 1933, the company used the process of fusing glass to steel to make a large single-piece glass-lined brewery tank. Over the next 32 years, they made more than 11,000 glass-lined tanks. In 1936, the company patented the glass-lined water heater. Three years later, they began mass- producing residential water heaters, but shifted all production to war-time use during World War II. In 1940, the company acquired Sawyer Electric of Los Angeles, California, a manufacturer of electric motors. In 1942, it once again began to produce bomb casings, as well as aircraft propellers, undercarriages, torpedoes, and air flasks. By 1945, the company had built 4.5 million bombs, 16,750 sets of landing gear, and 46,700 propeller blades. They also built nose frames for the B-25 bomber, water heaters, jeep frames, and components for the atomic bomb project. In 1946, they built a 400,000 square foot residential water heater plant in Kankakee, Illinois. In 1948, they entered the commercial water heater market after acquiring The Burkay Company of Toledo, Ohio. In 1949, the company began producing Harvestore, a glass-fused-to-steel silo, targeted at dairy and livestock operations. In the 1950s, A. O. Smith acquired Whirl-A-Way Motors of Dayton, Ohio, and consolidated its electric motor manufacturing operations there. The motor division later introduced the hermetic motor, a critical component of air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Its water heater division introduced the first glass-lined commercial water heater, the A. O. Smith Burkay B-65, and later the company established a glass fiber division to replace steel in many applications. It also expanded into supplying oil field pipe and pipe for service stations, eventually becoming Smith Fiberglass Products in 1986. In the early 1960s, the company opened a commercial water heater and boiler plant in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. In 1965, the Motor division invented the enclosed canopy, two-compartment motor, a design that improved the reliability in pool pump motors by separating the switching components from the motor windings. In 1967, fourth generation Smith family member, Lloyd B. Smith, was elected chairman and chief executive officer of the company. By 1969, the company had produced its 10 millionth residential water heater, and by 1972, the company had expanded to Europe. In 1974, the Conservationist line of residential water heaters was introduced. In 1976, the Motor division opened a plant in Bray, Ireland, to supply hermetic motors. In 1978, A.O. Smith began manufacturing storage tanks, beginning with Aquastore, a glass-fused-to-steel tank. By the early 1980s, the Automotive Products unit had manufactured over 100 million passenger car frames, and 50 million truck frames, in Milwaukee, and soon after the company opened its first electric motor assembly operations in Ciudad Ju√°rez and Ciudad Acu√±a, Mexico. In 1990, it developed the first hermetic motor insulation system compatible with R-134a non-ozone-depleting refrigerant. In 1995, they acquired Peabody TecTank of Parsons, Kansas, allowing A.O. Smith to enter the bulk dry storage market. That same year the company expanded into Asia by entering two joint-venture agreements: Smith Fiberglass Products and Harbin Composites Corporation to make fiberglass pipes for the China's petroleum industry, and Water Products Company and Yuhan Water Heater to make residential water heaters. In 1996, the Water Products division introduced the Cyclone XHE commercial water heater. In 1997, after 90 years in the automotive industry, A.O. Smith sold its Automotive Products Company to Tower International. In 1997, they acquired UPPCO, Inc., making A.O Smith the world‚Äôs leading manufacturer of C-frame subfractional horsepower motors. In 1998, they acquired General Electric‚Äôs domestic compressor motor business, as well as the electric motor division of Magnetek. By the end of the decade, Water Products Company had bought out its joint venture partner in Asia, and had opened a plant in Nanjing, China. In the 2000s, A. O. Smith made a number of acquisitions, by acquiring State Industries, Inc., and its subsidiary APCOM Inc., Shenzhen Speeda Industrial Co. Ltd., and Athens Products, a supplier of hermetic motors for scroll compressor applications, as well as The Changheng Group of Changzhou, China, a manufacturer of fractional horsepower motors for HVAC applications, Taicang Special Motor Company, Ltd., of Suzhou, China, Yueyang Zhongmin Special Electrical Machinery Co. Ltd., Lochinvar Corporation, a manufacturer of high efficiency condensing boilers for hot water and hydronic heating applications, and in 2006, GSW Inc. a water heaters manufacturer for the Canadian market, and The American Water Heater Company, the exclusive supplier of water heaters to Lowe's, carrying the Whirlpool brand. In 2009, the company entered the water purification industry with a new venture, A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd. In 2010, A. O. Smith opened a 76,000 square foot residential water heater manufacturing plant in Bangalore, India, which later expanded to 297000 sq ft operation with expansion to manufacture of water purification products. Takagi Industrial Company's North American operations were acquired in 2010.. In 2011, A.O. Smith sold its electric motor business to Regal-Beloit. On August 8, 2016, A.O.Smith, acquired Austin-based Water filtration Company Aquasana (previously known as Sun Water Systems) from L' Catterton for $87 Million. In 2016, A.O Smith was successfully sued by a Chicago area family because the company has refused to include a safety feature in their water heaters to prevent scalding deaths. Immediately after receiving the verdict, A.O. Smith appealed the decision in the Supreme Court and in December 2018 successfully got the verdict reversed. Brands  A.O. Smith operates under the following brand names around the world: A.O.

The genus contains a single described species, Arostropsis groehni. History and classification Arostropsis is known only from a single fossil, the holotype, specimen number \\"C 7968, GPIH 4516\\", which is housed in the fossil collection of the Geology and Palaeontology Institute and Museum, part of the University of Hamburg. The specimen is composed of a fully complete adult male broad- nosed weevil which has been preserved as an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Baltic amber. Baltic amber dates to between forty and forty-five million years old and the holotype specimen was found in the Prussian Formation. The Arostropsis holotype was recovered from an amber quarry in Jantarny near the city of Kaliningrad along the Baltic Sea coast in Russia. The fossil was first studied by paleoentomologists Nikolai N. Yunakov and Alexander G. Kirejtshuk, both of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Yunakov and Kirejtshuk's 2011 type description of the new genus and species was published in the online journal ZooKeys. The genus name Arostropsis was coined by Yunakov and Kirejtshuk as a combination of two Greek words r≈çstron meaning \\"beak or snout\\" and opsis which means \\"resembling (something)\\" in combination with the negative prefix a. The specific epithet groehni was coined in honor of Carsten Gr√∂hn who first collected the holotype specimen. Arostropsis is one of a number of broad-nosed weevils described from specimens in Baltic amber. As of the 2011 Yunakov and Kirejtshuk paper, at least eleven species had been described or suggested by paleoentomologists. rostrum and mandible Description The Arostropsis male adult has an overall coloration which appears to be metallic green and that is caused by numerous small lanceolate scales coating the legs and sides of the body. The male has an elongated body which is in length, tall, and with an overall width of . The rostrum is approximately one and a half times as long as it is wide and is noted for being narrower than the rest of the head. Only the left mandible is still present and attached to the head and the tip section has a distinct curve and the mandible as a whole has a knife like shape. The legs are elongated and with the protibiae hosting a row of slender spines. The tip of the tibia, called the corbel, is open, lacking a second row of spines. Arostropsis is distinguished from the modern genera of Naupactini that have open corbels by the narrow rostrom and morphology of the antennae.

It stars Temuera Morrison and Kate Elliot. It is Danny Mulheron's directorial debut. The film had its world premiere at the 32nd Hawaii International Film Festival on 15 October 2012. It had its New Zealand premiere on 25 October. Plot Rina Crane is a teenage student experimenting sexually with her fellow female students in the shower before being picked up from school by her father Hemi, an associate professor dissatisfied with not being made a full professor due to perceived discrimination against Maori natives. His wife, Rina's mother Margaret, is a famous and successful food guru. The parents' relationship is strained because Hemi believes Margaret had an affair with one of her associates which is left unclear as to whether this is the case or just a result of his paranoia. Rina's brother Glenn is not yet home. When Rina finds a human hand in a dish inside the refrigerator looking as though it has been prepared to be eaten, she is terrified, and rather than acting surprised, her parents merely look as though she hasn't yet had the situation explained. Meanwhile, Richie Tan, a criminal being transported in a police van, is busted out by his brother Paulie and Richie's girlfriend Gigi, who have hired explosives 'expert' Johnny who manages to flip the police van over and while successfully extracting Richie, injures him and causes massive tension among everyone in the group. In order to evade police and lay low, they crash the van they make their getaway in into the Cranes' open garage and hold the family at gunpoint. Johnny happens to be a fan of Margaret's and monopolizes her while Richie takes Rina to her room to exploit her sexually. He dresses in her bra and panties and while she pretends to be interested in him, bites his crotch until it bleeds, forcing the other criminals and family back into the same area. Gigi is furious with Richie for attempting to cheat on her and by now has started to flirt with Rina, who attempts to persuade her to turn on her criminal friends. Paulie finds a trapdoor in the kitchen and opens it, and is instantly killed by a booby trap inside, after which his friends discover it leads to an underground butchery where Rina's parents and brother have been ritually killing, slicing up and preparing for consumption the bodies of other human beings. With their cannibalism revealed, the family turn viciously upon their captors and brutally kill all but Gigi who is knocked out but will eventually be eaten as well. Rina is horrified and refuses to go along with her family's insane tradition inspired by historical events her father studies. A boy from school who fancies her drops in unannounced as the family sits down to dinner and Rina's parents continue to attempt to persuade her, talking her friend into unwittingly eating a testicle in spite of his vegetarianism. Rina tries forcefully to get him to leave but he sees other intact body parts on his plate and realizes what has just happening, causing her family to murder him as well. A police officer going door to door to warn citizens about the group of criminals on the loose in their area manages to get inside the house after Rina acts suspiciously, causing him to also be murdered and subsequently an entire SWAT team arrives at the house. By now Rina's father has gone completely unhinged and, after Glenn fails to properly prepare one of the bodies as the ritual demands, their father slices Glenn's chest open and rips out his beating heart, taking a bite out of it, believing that feasting on the heart, flesh and blood of his own offspring will render him immortal. Margaret, now realizing Hemi was practicing their religious rites selfishly, turns against him but is overpowered and used as a human shield against Rina. Gigi awakens and comes to her aid but cannot attack Hemi with Margaret hostage, and when they try, she loses an arm to a badly aimed slice with a butcher's knife. The police start shooting into the house and Hemi is obsessed with devouring Rina, biting her and drinking some of her blood, but Gigi saves her and is injured in the process. Rina stands up to him, now the sole survivor of the family apart from him, and turns on all the gas in the kitchen, preparing to blow the house up to stop her father. The police shoot a gas grenade into the house disorienting them and just as another shot into the house is about to ignite the gas, Gigi, disguised as one of the SWAT team, grabs Rina and ejects both of them through a window, leaving Hemi to be incinerated. Gigi and Rina kiss, and as they observe the ruins of the house, a charred hand reaches up and grabs Gigi's arm, leaving it unknown whether Hemi merely survived or is truly immortal.

It is found on reefs in very shallow parts of the western Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea.  Description  The reef urchin has an elliptical reddish brown test (shell) covered with medium length spines. These are greenish in colour with paler bases and darker, often violet, tips. This urchin grows to a diameter of with the longest spines being . It looks very similar to the rock-boring urchin Echinometra lucunter, but the dark tips and the greater length of the spines are distinctive.  Distribution  The reef urchin is found on reefs in the Caribbean Sea from southern Florida to Venezuela at depths down to about . It is not as common as the rock-boring urchin and seems to be absent from the West Indies to the east of the Virgin Islands.  Biology  The reef urchin conceals itself in crevices or under boulders. It emerges at night to feed by grazing on algae with its five teeth, part of the Aristotle's lantern organ that surrounds its mouth. It is not believed to bore holes, but its grazing still causes bioerosion in reefs. In Panama, breeding takes place during the period April to December. It does not seem to be correlated with the phases of the moon as in some other sea urchin species. Fertilisation is external and the echinopluteus larvae are planktonic. When these settle, they undergo a rapid metamorphosis into juvenile sea urchins. Researchers have studied the likely effect on the reef urchin of a rise in the carbon dioxide levels which are likely to increase ocean acidification by the end of the 21st century. It was found that the urchins would be negatively impacted because of decreased calcification, lowering their ability to build their tests, especially during winter and in the more northerly parts of their range.  Ecology  The reef urchin is an important grazer on fleshy algae in the Caribbean area. Its abundance is reduced by predation by fish, especially the jolthead porgy (Calamus bajonado), the queen triggerfish (Balistes vetula), the ocean triggerfish (Canthidermis sufflamen) and the hogfish (Lachnolaimus maximus). Because of this predation, the reef urchin avoids open reef flats and in these locations there is an overgrowth of fleshy algae. It is unable to take over the algal controlling role of the black sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) which is subject to great fluctuations in population.

Anob was the first known child born to the Arsacid Prince Arsaces II (Arshak II) by an unnamed mother. He was born to his father at an unknown date from a union prior to his father‚Äôs Kingship of Armenia. Arsaces II ruled as the Roman Client King of Armenia from 350 until 368 and Anob was one of the grandsons to the previous ruling Roman Client Armenian King Tiran (Tigranes VII) who ruled from 339 until 350. The mother of Anob appeared to have died before the year 358. The Armenian Historian of the 5th century, Faustus of Byzantium in his writings History of the Armenians (Book IV, Chapter 15) indirectly mentions Anob as a cousin of Gnel and Tirit.

Montano returned to the practice of law in Philadelphia and was appointed Senior Trial Attorney with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1979. In this position, Montano represented the United States Government in federal civil rights employment cases. In 1981, Montano was appointed Executive Director of the Suffolk County Human Rights Commission, where he served for eight years. He then formed the law firm of Montano & Calisto, and also served as legal counsel to New York State Senator Larry Seabrook of the Bronx.  Political career  In 1999, Montano was appointed Assistant Attorney General for the State of New York in the Suffolk Regional Office. In November 2003, he was elected Suffolk County Legislator from the 9th District. Rick has run unopposed, and has been reelected, four times to the Suffolk County Legislature. In his former position, Legislator Montano represented Brentwood, Central Islip, and parts of Islandia. Legislator Montano served as the Chairperson of the Ways and Means Committee, Vice Chairperson of the Parks and Recreation Committee, and a member of the Veterans and Seniors Committee. In September and November 2013, Montano was defeated by Monica Martinez. = New York State Senate Race 2012 = On July 10, 2012, Montano surprised many when he filed petitions with 2,567 signatures with the Suffolk Board of Elections in what was to prove an unsuccessful bid win a NY State Senate seat held by incumbent Republican State Senator Owen Johnson. Senator Johnson, after 40 years in office announced that he would be retiring and Assemblyman Phil Boyle won the Republican, Independence and Conservative Party nominations as well as the lion's share of endorsements from labor, environmental groups and law enforcement. Montano lost the election by approximately 6000 votes.  Sex Offender Vote Controversy  On November 16, 2010 the Suffolk County Legislature voted to authorize a vendor to house homeless sex offenders in secret locations around the County. Resolution 1189 passed the legislature with Ricardo Montano'shttp://legis.suffolkcountyny.gov/Resos2010/i2105-10.pdf vote in favor and was ultimately vetoed by County Executive Steve Levy. The controversial issue was extended when Legislator Montano voted to override the Executive veto. The votes have become a central issue in Legislator Montano's attempt to win a seat in the New York State Senate. Newsday has covered the issue extensively.  Newsday Endorsement  On October 19, 2012, Newsday published its endorsements for New York State Senate. Out of the nine State Senators that represent Long Island, Rick Montano was the only Democrat endorsed by Newsday. The article further emphasized the importance of this endorsement by stating, \\"This is the marquee State Senate race\\". The Newsday editorial board judged the two candidates' positions on supporting the DREAM Act, lowering property taxes, and reducing unfunded state mandates to be similar. The candidates do differ, however, on several key issues. Rick Montano supports equal pay for women, as well as increasing the minimum wage, maintaining school funding, and protecting the local environment. Toward the end of the endorsement, Newsday concluded, \\"What's appealing about Montano is his high level of independence, his intelligence, his long resume in civil rights jobs at the federal and county level, plus service with the state attorney general.\\"  Vote on MTA Payroll Tax  On September 16, 2010, The Suffolk County Legislature held a vote on a resolution (I.R. 1875) - Directing the County Attorney to bring an action against New York State regarding the MTA payroll tax. The resolution passed with strong bipartisan support with 17 votes in favor and a single vote to oppose, which was cast by Legislator Monatano. The lawsuit ultimately succeeded when Justice R. Bruce Cozzens ruled in favor of the County by declaring the New York City MTA's $1.2 payroll tax unconstitutional.

The videos detailed abuse similar to the Abu Ghraib scandal. The scandal was unique in Georgian history in that it was initially shared and discussed on social media, before the story began to appear on Georgia's largely pro- government television channels. Besides the images of stark physical abuse - which included the use of broomsticks and lit cigarettes - the videos displayed abuse perceived as having implications related to homosexuality, which is a largely taboo subject in Georgia's ultra-conservative religious culture. On 18 September 2012, after days of rumors on social media, Georgian national TV channels began broadcasting several video recordings of torture and rape in Gldani Prison in the capital of Georgia, Tbilisi. The highly controversial video footage resulted in orchestrated rallies in cities such as Tbilisi, Batumi, Poti, Kutaisi and Gori. Upset by images of graphic prisoner abuse, protestors demanded justice and promised to continue their protests. Later that night Khatuna Kalmakhelidze fired David Chakua, the Chairman of the Penitentiary Department.David Chakhua profile Several days later, Kalmakhelidze herself resigned. Background and history Part of Gldani where the prison is located Several persons suspected of inhumane treatment of prison inmates were detained and later convicted as a result of an investigation into the case. Hours before the video was released, the Georgian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday afternoon that three officials of the Gldani prison were arrested for inhuman treatment of inmates. The ministry also released footage showing two prison guards beating an inmate in a cell. The Interior Ministry has claimed that the arrested prison officials abused inmates and made video records of it in exchange for money in a deal arranged by Tamaz Tamazashvili, an inmate who is serving his jail term in the same prison facility.Videos of Inmates Abuse, Rape Emerge Tamaz Tamazashvili is supported by the political party Georgian Dream, which grants him a senior position in the newly created government. They also assert that Tamaz is a political prisoner. The video evidence of prison torture was leaked to TV channels by a former prison officer Vladimir Bedukadze, who was briefly wanted in connection with the abuse, but was eventually exempted from all criminal liability.Vladimir Bedukadze thanks government for exemption from criminal liability In his interview to TV-9 Bedukadze claimed that torture of the inmates had been ordered by the Minister of the Interior Bacho Akhalaia and that the Minister of corrections and legal assistance Khatuna Kalmakhelidze was aware of acts of torture in various Georgian prisons. Khatuna Kalmakhelidze asked for resignation later the same day. Videos Prisoners are shown being raped with broom handles and police batons. * The first video shows ten prison guards conducting physical and verbal abuse on prisoners. * In the second video a man is forced to take off his underpants and do what he was told. He is then insulted and spat upon; During the offence, an attacker makes references to him being a thief in law. In the last part of the video, the man is seen writing something under dictation. * In the third video an Armenian prisoner is shown fettered to a cell rod and cursing Georgian prison officers.Armenian prisoner among the abused in Georgian Gldani prison In the same video a masked man is appealing to the torturers not to record a video of him. He is mocked, humiliated and possibly raped. The third part of the video shows a rear view of a man who is repeatedly asked if he was thief in law answers of which were all: \\"I am a thief in law!\\". * In the fourth video is shown youth detention center, where inmates were physically abused and forced to insult thief in laws under threat of being raped if they did not comply.

The protests drew a large number of students who protested the condition of the prison system and the inhumane treatment of prisoners shown in the video. Student groups declared that the scandal was not an isolated case and emphasized that this was the fault of the system, which needed to change. The absence of free, impartial media sources and freedom of expression was also a cause of the protests. Following the scandal, student protest groups largely forgot about the scandal, and the issue was rarely discussed by the subsequent government.

Prisoners who completed the recovery program work with mentally and physically disabled clients. During World War II, it was a Nazi German prison, a place of secret detention and torture of Polish members of the Resistance, Armia Krajowa.

The post of the Kommandeur of these two services was occupied from September 1943 until the end of the Nazi rule in Cracow on 17 January 1945 by Rudolf Batz (19031961) who for fifteen and a half years after the War (until November 1960) avoided capture by living under an assumed identity.Alwin Ramme, Der Sicherheitsdienst der SS: Zu seiner Funktion im faschistischen Machtapparat und im Besatzungsregime des sogenannten Generalgouvernements Polen, Berlin, Deutscher Milit√§rverlag, 1970, pp. 259, 280.

After the War, the facility continued to be used by the communist authorities of Poland for detention of political prisoners in the Soviet-backed struggle for control over the Polish nation: in March 1946 the prison housed 275 inmates.  Physical structure  The building not intended for prison use was originally designed by the Polish architect Ferdynand Liebling (18771942) as a mixed-use courthouse-cum-taxation office for the town of Podg√≥rze (Ger., Josefsstadt) and constructed in 1905 when the area was under Austrian occupation. The date of the establishment of prison facilities on the premises is unknown. Podg√≥rze, originally a separate town, was incorporated into the municipality of Cracow by a decision of the Podg√≥rze city council in 1915. Wartime records, including the memoirs of Tadeusz Pankiewicz, indicate that a court was still functional here in Nazi times of the Second World War, at least nominally (the prison being the chief feature), while communist-era press reports cite an operational circuit court together with the prison on the premises in post-War years, suggesting a conversion to an all-prison use in 1971 when the court ceased operations.Cf. \\"Obwieszczenie o licytacji nieruchomo≈õci\\" (Notice of Forfeited Real-estate Auction), Dziennik Polski (Cracow), No. 63 (4993), 15 March 1960, p. 5. The prison administration quarters housed in the post-War years an office of the District Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes (Okrƒôgowa Komisja Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich, a defunct governmental body now subsumed within the IPN whose purview includes Communist in addition to Nazi crimes).Cf. \\"Komunikat Okrƒôgowej Komisji Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich\\" (A Communiqu√© of the District Commission for the Investigation of Nazi Crimes), Dziennik Polski (Cracow), No. 104 (8458), 4 May 1971, p. 3. During the Third Republic, on 22 May 1996, the prison complex was entered on the register of historical monuments protected by law, a fact further confirmed by an additional resolution of the City Council of 28 June 2006.\\"Wykaz obiekt√≥w i zespo≈Ç√≥w objƒôtych prawnƒÖ ochronƒÖ i opiekƒÖ konserwatorskƒÖ oraz ochronƒÖ ustalonƒÖ planem\\" (Register of Legally Protected Monuments and Complexes subject to Conservation and Planned Protection), Addendum No. 3 to the City Council Resolution No. CXIII/1156/6 June 28, 2006 (see online).  Current status  Despite being recognized as both a historical monument and a place of martyrdom, the facility continues to be operated to this day as a combination of remand prison and ordinary correctional facility by the Polish Prison Administration (the S≈Çu≈ºba Wiƒôzienna), a unit of the Polish Justice Ministry. Its current official name is Areszt ≈öledczy Krak√≥w Podg√≥rze. One of its former names was Zak≈Çad Karny Krak√≥w-Podg√≥rze.

The film was released by Warner Bros. under their Warner Bros. Family Entertainment label. Plot The film opens with an elderly woman named Ms. Bee Bee, who reveals herself to be a kindly witch, telling the audience about the town of Grisham Heights, owned by the selfish and dance obsessed Count Grisham. She explains that she was Grisham's dance teacher, until he chased her into hiding when he accidentally discovered that she was a witch, and was forced to live in an abandoned house far outside of the village, with only her magic broom Bristles for company. She then goes on to explain the town's workhouse mill, which is where all orphans and debtors are sent to work off their debts, and that it takes thirteen pieces of silver to buy your freedom. Ms. Bee Bee then introduces the audience to Polly, a girl who has been in the mill nearly her whole life, but has been saving her silver coins and hiding them at the foot of her scarecrow (without realizing that Ms. Bee Bee lives at the house). Because she is lonely, Ms. Bee Bee decides to bring her scarecrow to life after Polly leaves, using a magic feather to do so, which also allows a pessimistic mouse, Max, who lives in the Scarecrow's pocket, to talk. As the years pass, Scarecrow begins to fall in love with Polly after her constant visits. It's shown by Ms. Bee Bee that Polly earned her required amount a long time ago, but decided to stay when three young orphans arrived, and wished to help them so they could leave together. Seeing that Scarecrow is in love with Polly, and worried she'll be discovered and chased away again, Ms. Bee Bee leaves the village, telling Scarecrow that she will miss him and teaches him how to dance. Scarecrow is saddened, but determined to find a way to be with Polly and watch over her money until she is able to free herself and the children. Meanwhile, Count Grisham wants Polly to be his, and constantly attempts to woo her with promises of giving her and the children a good life and home, though Polly is able to see right through his selfish act and continuously turns him down. On the day she earns the last silver coin they need, Grisham finds out and sends the workhouse mill overseer, Cheswick, to find Polly's silver. Cheswick follows Polly to the old garden, and digs up her money after she leaves, but Scarecrow reveals himself in an attempt to retrieve it and frightens Cheswick, who runs to Grisham's two thugs for help. They corner Scarecrow in the old house, where he discovers a magic feather and a message left to him by Ms. Bee Bee, which tells him that the feather (when worn) will turn him human, but that \\"real life\\" will never be his until he is willing to give that life for another. Scarecrow dons the feather and easily fools Grisham's thugs into believing he is merely a traveler named Feathertop, and they leave, though Cheswick is not convinced. Meanwhile, Polly returns to the garden to find her money gone, and weeps in despair. The next morning, Grisham comes up with a plan to ensnare Polly with his \\"love spell dance\\" to make her his by holding a dance contest, with 52 pieces of silver (the exact amount she needs) as the prize. Feathertop shows off his dancing skills to a crowd in the town square, which prompts Polly to ask him to teach her and be her partner at the dance. During her lesson, the two share a romantic dance and begin to fall in love, until Grisham interrupts to ask Polly to be his partner. He is angry to learn that she already has a partner, and on the night of the contest sends his thugs to trap Feathertop so he cannot attend. Feathertop escapes the thugs and he and Polly win the contest. Feathertop gives all the money to Polly, and the two confess their love for each other, and plan to marry the next morning. Grisham confronts Feathertop, discovering his true identity. He ties Scarecrow up in the same field and steals his feather, which transforms him into Feathertop upon wearing it, hoping to trick Polly into marrying him, but Bristles and Max manage to remove the feather off of him just before he enters the Church. Grisham tries to force her to marry him, but she, and the priest, refuse to go along with it. Scarecrow manages to escape, and retrieves his feather thanks to Max, but decides to leave Polly because he knows he can never truly be with her. Polly is still waiting for him at the church when Grisham angrily tells his manservant Wooden that he intends to kill Polly for rejecting him, but Wooden abandons him to warn Polly. Bristles, who was eavesdropping, flies off to warn Feathertop. Polly and the children attempt to escape town in Grisham's carriage, but the only way out is across a bridge over a gorge that Grisham ordered his thugs to weaken. Feathertop arrives and climbs under to hold the supports together until Polly and the children are safely across. Grisham tries to intervene, and in the struggle falls to his death. Feathertop manages to hold the bridge together long enough for the carriage to cross, then falls into the gorge as it collapses. Max and Bristles search the rubble and find him apparently dead, but are overjoyed to see him alive, and they climb out of the gorge together. Polly is waiting at the top, and joyfully embraces Feathertop, who tries to explain why they can't be together, only to realize that his feather fell out of his hat when he climbed out of the gorge, meaning he is now human permanently. He and Polly kiss, and the town celebrates Grisham's demise by cleaning up and holding a large dance in the town square and renaming the town Swingtown, while Ms. Bee Bee brings a girl broom to life for Bristles, and closes the film by addressing the audience the same way she did at the beginning.

The conflict was between the Spanish forces commanded by Don Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and the Protestant forces of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, during the Palatinate campaign in the context of the Thirty Years' War.Hubert Granville Revell Reade: Sidelights on the Thirty Years War p.339 After a quick start of the invasion of states of Frederick V, proclaimed King of Bohemia, the operations slowed in mid-September, after the Capture of Oppenheim.Ibarra p.367 Don Ambrosio Spinola, the Spanish general in command, assessed at a council of war the choice between undertaking the siege of Heidelberg or, secondarily, the town of Bacharach.Ibarra p.366 The Spanish officers decided to take Bacharach due to the small number of Frederick's scattered forces.Ibarra p.368 On 1 October C√≥rdoba captured Bacharach with a force of 2,500 soldiers, forcing the Anglo-German defenders to surrender. Background After securing stores of food and ammunition through the Capture of Oppenheim, Spinola had a choice between taking Heidelberg or Bacharach. On 23 September Spinola consulted with the Spanish commanders, Don Carlos Coloma, Don Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Don Diego Fel√≠pez de Guzm√°n and Hendrik van den Bergh. There was talk of marching on Heidelberg, Frankenthal or Bacharach, but finally Spinola decided to opt for Bacharach. Bacharach was an important strategic point because it was a bridgehead over the Rhine and would be a link between the part of the Palatinate occupied by the Spaniards and the city of Mainz. In addition, the operation would buy time for the arrival of reinforcements expected from the Spanish Netherlands. On 27 September, news came to Spinola that a force from the United Provinces of about 5,000 men under the command of Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg and Sir Horace Vere had crossed the Moselle in Kerpen to support Frederick V.Ibarra p.369 Spinola, ignoring the entity of Vere's forces, composed of Dutch, English and Scottish volunteers sent by King James I of England,Pursell p.113 decided to move with his army to the west bank of the Rhine and await the Protestant forces. With his attention centered on the arrival of the Anglo-Dutch relief, Spinola remained near the road with the bulk of his army, and entrusted the capture of Bacharach to Don Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba. Battle Don Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba View of Kaub and Pfalzgrafenstein Castle Don Ambrosio Spinola by Peter Paul Rubens On 29 September C√≥rdoba marched with his forces and captured Lorch, forcing the few defenders to surrender. He had also sent another group of about 2,000 men directly to Bacharach. This group approached the outskirts of Bacharach at about 2 am. With the arrival of the Spaniards, the Protestant soldiers outside the town threw down their muskets and fled into the town. C√≥rdoba's men then proceeded to build a bulwark behind the town. At dawn, the defenders, aided by heavy mist, fired shots of musket, killing three Spaniards and wounding three more. Shortly thereafter the bulk of the forces led by C√≥rdoba arrived. Demoralised by the arrival of the Spanish, the officers of the garrison decided to surrender. The Spanish troops entered Bacharach at 3 pm. Two captainsEnglish Captains Dexter and Row. Wilson pp. 135‚Äì137 and 94 English soldiers, among other German troops, were taken prisoners.Wilson p. 135‚Äì137 Aftermath C√≥rdoba left a garrison of 300 soldiers in Bacharach and sent most of his troops under the commanders Diego Ruiz and Baltasar de Santander to capture Kaub.Ibarra p.371 The small garrison of that town soon surrendered. Shortly thereafter, the Spaniards took the Pfalzgrafenstein Castle. Spinola, meanwhile, focused on intercepting the Anglo-Dutch relief, but the Protestant force did not appear. The Anglo-Dutch force went instead to Worms unhindered.Ibarra p.373 In August 1621, Mainz fell to Spinola's army of 15,000 men, now under the command of C√≥rdoba.Lawrence p.79 Meanwhile, General Spinola, on his return to the Netherlands where the Eighty Years' War was still going on, lay siege to J√ºlich, and after five months of siege the city fell to the Spaniards, reversing Maurice's success of 1610.

Historical Development Access and transfer of passenger name records (PNRs) fall under the purview of European Data Protection Law. Under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 1980 Privacy Guidelines, and the 1995 European Union Directive on data protection, PNRs may only be transferred to countries with comparable data protection laws.Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (23 September 1980), available at http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,2340,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html Also, law enforcement authorities are permitted to access the passenger data only on a case-by-case basis, and where there exists a particular suspicion. In the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks, the US government determined that PNRs (both archived and real-time) were invaluable tools for investigating and thwarting terrorist attacks. Accordingly, the US government has sought the collection, transfer and retention of PNRs by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. In May 2004, the US government negotiated the 2004 Passenger Name Record Data Transfer agreement (aka. US-EU PNR agreement) ‚Äì a safe harbor PNR transfer agreement with the European Commission. Specifically, the European Commission deemed that the level of protection afforded to such PNR transfers would satisfy the standard of \\"adequacy\\" required by the 1995 EU Data Directive, as long as the data would be transferred and used solely for the purposes for which it was collected. These purposes being limited to \\"preventing and combating: terrorism and related crimes; other serious crimes, including organized crime, that are trans-national in nature; and flight from warrants or custody for those crimes.\\"Agreement between the European Community. and the U.S. on the processing and transfer of PNR data by air carriers to the U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bureau of Customs and Border Prot.

Xiangtu (ÈÑâÂúü), literally meaning the hometown soil, symbolizes nativism; and Wenxue (ÊñáÂ≠∏) is literature. Nativist Literature refers to a genre in Taiwanese literature. It derived from the Taiwanese New Literature Movement (Âè∞ÁÅ£Êñ∞ÊñáÂ≠∏ÈÅãÂãï) under the Japanese rule in the 1920s, died down after 1937 when the Japanese government strengthened its colonial policy, and recaptured public attention in the 1970s. Taiwan nativist literature uses literary realism as its main narrative to depict people, events and subjects that happen in Taiwan, aiming at reflecting the particularity of the local society.Lin Shuzhen (ÊûóÊ∑ëË≤û). \\"The Demarcation and Genre Variation of Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶ÁöÑÁïåÂÆö‰∏éÊµÅÂèò).\\" In Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶), edited by Lin Shuzhen, Lin Wenbao, Lin Suwen, Zhou Qinhua, Zhang Tangqi, and Chen Xinyuan (ÊûóÊñáÂØ∂, ÊûóÊ∑ëË≤û, ÊûóÁ¥†Á¥ã, Âë®ÊÖ∂ËèØ, ÂºµÂ†ÇÈå°, Èô≥‰ø°ÂÖÉ). Chap. 1. Taipei: Wan Juan Lou (Ëê¨Âç∑Ê®ì), 2001. The nativist novels usually depict the struggles for existence and predicaments of identity of the Taiwanese people with a humanistic tone. They tend to base on the life experiences of their authors, and reflect their worldviews.Weng Shengfeng (ÁøÅËÅñÂ≥∞). \\"Taiwan Nativist Literature.\\" Encyclopedia of Taiwan, Council for Cultural Affairs. Accessed on 17 Sep 2012. The Taiwan New Literature movement Under the colonial modernization in Taiwan, through colonial education, study in Japan and mainland China, Taiwan‚Äôs first generation intellectuals were informed of modern politics, society, culture and ideas of the West. They embraced concepts such as national self-determination, democracy, freedom, and socialism. They were also inspired by various events such as the Taish≈ç Democracy Movement, socialist movement and leftist movement in Japan, and the May Fourth Movement, the New Culture Movement, and anti- imperialism movement in China. Since the 1920s, Taiwanese intellectuals had moved away from violent resistance into organized and non-violent, cultural, political and social struggles against the Japanese government.You Shengguan (Ê∏∏ËÉúÂÜ†). \\"The Birth of Nativism in Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶Êú¨ÂúüËÆ∫ÁöÑÂèëËΩ´).\\" In The Rise and the Development of Nativism in Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶Êú¨ÂúüËÆ∫ÁöÑÂÖ¥Ëµ∑‰∏éÂèëÂ±ï). Chap. 2. Taipei: Qian Wei (ÂâçÂç´), 1996. In 1920, Cai Huiru (Ëî°ÊÉ†Â¶Ç) et al. founded the Xin Min Society (Êñ∞Ê∞ë‰ºö) in Tokyo in January and published Taiwan Youth („ÄäÂè∞ÊπæÈùíÂπ¥„Äã) magazine in July, in order to promote cultural enlightenment (ÊñáÂåñÂêØËíô). In response, Jiang Weishui/Chiang Wei-shui (Ëî£Ê∏≠Ê∞¥) et al. founded the Taiwan Culture Association (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂåñÂçè‰ºö) in Taiwan in 1921, which was the prelude of the anti-colonial and national emancipatory movements there. The Association shared the same anti-imperialist spirit with the May Fourth Movement in China. The literature movement was brought into Taiwan as a tool to exercise cultural enlightenment, increase education standards and to awaken the public to stand up against the colonial authority. The Taiwan New Literature movement incorporated the May Fourth Literature model, engaging with language reform and literary realism. First, it tried to synchronize speaking with writing (Ë®ÄÊñáÂêà‰∏Ä) by promoting the use of modern Chinese (ÁôΩË©±Êñá) as opposed to classical Chinese (ÊñáË®ÄÊñá). The use of modern Chinese could help increase the general literacy and keep connection with mainland China, and it symbolized the erection of the New and the abandon of the Old. Zhang Wojun (ÂºµÊàëËªç) was one of the main advocates who positioned Taiwan literature as a branch of Chinese literature, tried to bring in more Chinese elements into Taiwan literature, and wanted to use modern Chinese to reform the Taiwanese vernacular. Second, as being positioned as a branch of Chinese literature, the Movement aimed at liberating Taiwan from Japanese colonizers with an intention to return to China. It followed the anti-imperialist and anti-feudalist realistic style of the May Fourth literature. Here, the use of modern Chinese against the then official language of Taiwan‚ÄîJapanese also played an important role to support the advocates‚Äô Chinese identity. The Rise of Taiwan nativist literature However, the ultimate goal of the Taiwan New Literature movement was not to preserve Chinese language, culture or literature, but to awaken the Taiwanese public and to liberate Taiwan. The colonial Taiwan had a different situation than mainland China regarding to its colonial policy, social awareness and natural environment etc. Hence, that whether the May Fourth model was completely suitable for Taiwan was under challenge. Soon as the Movement started in 1920, there were intellectuals like Zhuang Chuisheng (Â∫ÑÂûÇÁõõ) who challenged whether modern Chinese was compatible with the local situation in Taiwan, and Lian Wenqing (ÈÄ£Ê∏©Âçø) who underlined the importance to study and utilize Taiwan vernacular since it was the most popularized language in Taiwan. In 1925, Huang Chengcong (ÈªÑÂëàËÅ∞) in his essay ‚ÄòWe should establish a particular Taiwanese culture‚Äô (Â∫îËØ•ËëóÂàõËÆæÂè∞ÊπæÁâπÁßçÁöÑÊñáÂåñ) argued that although Taiwan shared the same bloodline with China in aspects like race, society, culture and custom, the unique geography and environment of Taiwan had cultivated a particularity in its own culture in its 200-year history; and especially after it was ceded to Japan, Taiwan was different from China in its society and culture under the Japanese rule; all these experiences had made the native-ity (Êú¨ÂúüÊÄß) of Taiwan easily perceptible. Huang suggested that considering this native-ity, Taiwan should not totally and uncritically accept Chinese culture (like the May Fourth Literature model), but adapt the imported culture according to the native reality and so establish a particular Taiwanese culture. In 1927, the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation broke down. Chiang Kai- shek ordered a crackdown on the workers‚Äô and peasants‚Äô movements in China. That the Chinese anti-imperialist movement reached a deadlock disappointed the Taiwanese intellectuals. Meanwhile, the Japanese authority tightened the colonial policy which cut off the connection and support from mainland China. Furthermore, by February 1931, almost all the anti-Japanese organizations in Taiwan had been dissolved. More intellectuals turned to the literature movement, which was less annoying to the Japanese. The Taiwan New Literature movement reached its heyday, and the nativism in literature also started to rise. Taiwan nativist literature in the 1930s In 1930 and 1931, Huang Shihui, followed by Guo Qiusen, launched the Nativist Literature Polemic (ÈÑâÂúüÊñáÂ≠∏Ë´ñÊà∞) and the Taiwanese Vernacular Polemic (Âè∞ÁÅ£Ë©±ÊñáË´ñÊà∞), which marked the full bloom of the Taiwan New Literature movement. According to Ye Shitao (ËëâÁü≥Êø§), the Polemics showed that the object of the Taiwan New Literature reform had moved from forms into contents, and Taiwan literature began to move towards independence from the Chinese New Literature Movement.Lin Ruiming (ÊûóÁëûÊòé).\\"The Taiwanese New Literature Movement under the Japanese Rule: Literary Communities and Their Spirit (Êó•Êú¨ÁªüÊ≤ª‰∏ãÁöÑÂè∞ÊπæÊñ∞ÊñáÂ≠¶ËøêÂä®ÔºöÊñáÂ≠¶ÁªìÁ§æÂèäÂÖ∂Á≤æÁ•û).\\" In The Native Observation on Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶ÁöÑÊú¨ÂúüËßÇÂØü), edited by Li Yihui (ÊùéÊÄ°ÊÖß). Chap. 1. Taipei: Yun Chen Wen Hua (ÂÖÅÊô®ÊñáÂåñ), 1996. =The Nativist Literature Polemic= In 1930, Huang Shihui published the essay ‚ÄòWhy not promote Taiwan nativist literature‚Äô (ÊÄéÈ∫º‰∏çÊèêÂÄ°Âè∞ÁÅ£ÈÑâÂúüÊñáÂ≠∏) in the Wu Ren newspaper („Ää‰ºç‰∫∫Â†±„Äã), gaining some debate. In the next year, Huang and Guo Qiusen published essays ‚ÄòTalk about nativist literature again‚Äô (ÂÜçË∞à‰π°ÂúüÊñáÂ≠¶) and ‚ÄòA proposal to develop Taiwanese vernacular‚Äô (Âª∫Ë®≠‚ÄòÂè∞ÊπæË©±Êñá‚Äô‰∏ÄÊèêÊ°à) respectively in Taiwan News („ÄäÂè∞ÊπæÊñ∞ËÅû„Äã), triggering a large-scale debate on whether it was feasible to use Taiwanese vernacular in writing Taiwan nativist literature. Huang‚Äôs opinion was similar to idea of popularization upheld by the worldwide proletarian literature movement which saw the toiling masses as the main audience of literary creations. Huang insisted that only by using Taiwanese vernacular to write could literature penetrate into the masses and have influence on them. He also contended that Taiwan is the home of Taiwanese writers, so they should treat Taiwan and its public as the focal points in their literature. A colonial fact about Taiwan was that the official language was Japanese; modern Chinese could not be taught in the education system. Furthermore, Standard Chinese, which is based on the Beijing vernacular, was different from the Taiwanese vernacular which was widely used in Taiwan in those days. Modern Chinese, like Japanese, stayed as a language used in the small intellectual circle. Insisting on using modern Chinese to write could not attain the expected result of synchronizing writing with speaking (ÊñáË®Ä‰∏ÄËá¥) like it did in mainland China. In other words, modern Chinese could not penetrate into the masses and fulfil its mission of the dissemination of culture. Guo in his essay illustrated the fact that Japanese, classical and modern Chinese were all difficult to be popularized among the masses, and responded the Huang‚Äôs stand by suggesting promoting the use of Taiwanese vernacular in order to eradicate illiteracy and disperse culture. Guo also proposed to subjugate writing to speaking (Â±àÊñáÂ∞±Ë©±). He started a special column called ‚ÄòTaiwanese vernacular attempt‚Äô (Âè∞ÊπæË©±ÊñáÂòóË©¶Ê¨Ñ), where he created many new ‚ÄòChinese‚Äô characters to match those words specifically used in the Taiwanese vernacular. He proved that it was feasible to write in Taiwanese vernacular. In summary, in the polemics, nativism advocates contended that firstly, nativist literature should be written in Taiwanese vernacular and secondly, authors should reflect the reality of Taiwan in their works and highlight the existence of the nativity of Taiwan. On the contrary, the opponents in the polemics who did not think literature should be written in Taiwanese vernacular argued that Taiwan and China should stay in one perspective; literary works written in Taiwanese vernacular lacked universality across China; and being too linguistically and culturally Taiwanese would hinder the cultural exchange between China and Taiwan. They insisted that Taiwan was part of China and it was not necessary to start a Taiwan nativist literature. Some opponents even saw Taiwanese vernacular as a primitive and crude language, so it was not good enough to be used in literature. Most of the opponents insisted in using modern Chinese. The opponents included Liao Yuwen, Lin Kefu, Zhu Dianren (ÂªñÊØìÊñáÔºåÊûóÂÖãÂ§´ÔºåÊú±Èªû‰∫∫) and so on. Nevertheless, despite of the difference, opponents and advocates of nativism shared the same standpoints of anti-Japanese colonization. =Publications, Societies, and Active Authors= From 1926 to 1937, literary publications and arts societies gradually sprang up in Taiwan. Most of them had anti-Japanese sentiments, and aimed at encouraging patriotism among the Taiwanese public. In 1927, Chen Manying, Lai He and Chen Shaoxin (ÈôàÊª°ÁõàÔºåËµñÂíåÔºåÈôàÁªçÈ¶®) founded the New Student Study Society (Êñ∞ÁîüÂ≠¶‰ºö), while overseas students in Japan, Xu Naichang, Yang Yunping, Yang Gui (ËÆ∏‰πÉÊòåÔºåÊù®‰∫ëËêçÔºåÊù®Ë¥µ) et al. organized the Social Science Study Group (Á§æ‰ºöÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÈÉ®). In 1932, Zhuang Chuisheng, IaÃçp √äng-cheng (Â∫ÑÂûÇËÉúÔºåËëâÁáüÈêò) et al. published the Southern Voice („ÄäÂçóÈü≥„Äã) magazine. In March 1933, overseas students Zhang Wenhuan, Wu Yongfu, Wang Baiyuan, Liu Jie, Su Weixiong, Shi Xuexi (ÂºµÊñáÁí∞ÔºåÂ∑´Ê∞∏Á¶èÔºåÁéãÁôΩÊ∑µÔºåÂäâÊç∑ÔºåËòáÁ∂≠ÁÜäÔºåÊñΩÂ≠∏Áøí) et al. founded the Taiwan Arts Society (Âè∞ÊπæËóùË°ìÁ†îÁ©∂‰ºö) in Tokyo, and published the Formosa („ÄäÁ¶èÁàæÊë©Ê≤ô„Äã) magazine. In October 1933, Guo Qiusen, Liao Hanchen, Huang Deshi, Wang Shilang, Chen Junyu, Lin Kefu (ÈÉ≠ÁßãÁîüÔºåÂªñÊº¢Ëá£ÔºåÈªÑÂæóÊôÇÔºåÁéãË©©ÁêÖÔºåÈô≥ÂêõÁéâÔºåÊûóÂÖãÂ§´) et al. founded the Taiwan Literature Association (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáËóùÂçè‰ºö) in Taipei, and published the Starting Force („ÄäÂÖàÁôºÈÉ®Èöä„Äã) magazine which was later renamed First Line („ÄäÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÁ∑ö„Äã). In 1934, the Taiwan Arts Society and the Taiwan Literature Association amalgamated into the Taiwan Literature and Arts League (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáËóùËÅØÁõü), and the League published the Taiwan Literature and Arts (Âè∞ÊπæÊñáËóù) magazine. In 1935, Yang Kui (Ê•äÈÄµ) and his wife left the Taiwan Literature and Arts magazine, and founded the Taiwan New Literature Society (Âè∞ÊπæÊñ∞ÊñáÂ≠¶Á§æ) with Ye Tao (ËëâÈô∂) and his wife. They published the New Taiwanese Literature (Âè∞ÊπæÊñ∞ÊñáÂ≠¶) magazine.See Lin Shuzhen, \\"The Demarcation and Genre Variation of Taiwanese Literature\\" and Lin Ruiming, \\"The Taiwanese New Literature Movement under the Japanese Rule.\\" The active Taiwanese authors during this period included Lai He, Zhang Wojun, Yang Yunping, Yang Shouyu (Ê•äÂÆàÊÑö), Cai Choudong (Ëî°ÊÑÅÊ¥û), Zhu Dianren, Xu Gu (ËôõË∞∑), Guo Qiusen, Yang Hua (Ê•äËèØ), Wang Shilang, Zhang Qingtang (ÂºµÊÖ∂Â†Ç), Zhang Shenqie (ÂºµÊ∑±Âàá), Huang Deshi, Wu Yongfu, Wu Tianshang (Âê≥Â§©Ë≥û), Wang Baiyuan et al. The suppression of Nativist Literature In the late stage of the Japanese colonization, there were a lot of literary works written in Japanese by Taiwanese authors coming into existence. This generation of authors did not have bilingual background as did their predecessors. Japanese was the only literal medium through which they understood the world and expressed their opinions. Thus, the Taiwanese vernacular polemic had lost its symbolic meaning to them. However, though they had to write in Japanese, they preserved very strong Taiwanese ideology and native-ity in their works. In April 1937, the Governor-General of Taiwan forbade the use of Chinese. Chinese writers nearly had to stop working completely. In July, the Second Sino-Japanese War began. In September, the colonial authority imposed the Kominka movement in order to replace Taiwanese culture and suppress the nationalism of Taiwanese people. In 1941, Zhang Wenhuan, Wang Jingquan (Áéã‰∫ïÊ≥â), Huang Deshi et al. left the Literature and Arts of Taiwan („ÄäÊñáËâ∫Âè∞Êπæ„Äã) magazine which was controlled by Nishikawa Mitsuru (Ë•øÂ∑ùÊ∫Ä) and organized the Qi Wen Society (ÂêØÊñáÁ§æ), and they published the Taiwan Literature („ÄäÂè∞ÊπæÊñáÂ≠¶„Äã) magazine for eleven volumes. In November 1943, Nishikawa announced the prohibition of association. Both the Literature and Arts of Taiwan and the Taiwan Literature were dismissed. Taiwanese authors lost their autonomy in writing. The following literary works were mostly done in order to meet the need of the Japanese invasions. However, there were still authors like Wu Zhuoliu who risked his life to write ‚ÄòThe Orphan of Asia‚Äô (‰∫ûÁ¥∞‰∫ûÂ≠§ÂÖí), recording the stories of Taiwanese people and sustaining the resistant spirit. After the defeat of Japan in August 1945, the then mainland-based Chinese nationalist KMT, under Chiang Kai-Shek, seized the island with the aim of re- uniting Taiwan with rest of China, and any assertion of local Taiwanese difference from China was suppressed.See You, \\"The Birth of Nativism in Taiwanese Literature,\\" and Lin Ruiming, \\"The Taiwanese New Literature Movement under the Japanese Rule.\\" Taiwanese identity After the period of suppression, another literary movement arose in the 1970s and 1980s, seeking to establish recognition of a distinctly Taiwanese body of literature. The Taiwanese literature movement expanded into democratization of the 1980s and 1990s.

It is located in the municipality of Hornafj√∂r√∞ur, southeast Iceland. Hoffellsj√∂kull takes its name from Hoffell; a mountainous area and a farmland. Hoffellsj√∂kull and the Hoffell area are a part of Vatnaj√∂kull National Park.  Geomorphology  A cold period, often named the Little Ice Age, begun around 1450. The outlet glacier Hoffellsj√∂kull began to advance from the Vatnaj√∂kull ice cap, over level and vegetated land. When the Hoffellsj√∂kull glacier tongue advanced, it blocked the lower openings of gorges in the mountains around Hoffellsfj√∂ll and N√∫par. Glacial lakes formed at Efstafellsvatn, Gj√°vatn and M√∫lavatn, and annual j√∂kulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) occurred. When the glacier retreated the dams were removed and the lakes had disappeared by 1985. The old water levels can still be clearly seen, for example at the site of Gj√°vatn where the water was up to 60 m deep.  Utilization  Hoffellsj√∂kull was largest around 1890 and for the next fifty years it reached the moraine ridge in front of it. Lorries used to be driven up onto this ridge, and filled with glacial ice which they transported to the town of H√∂fn. The ice was used for chilling fish, both onshore and at sea. Due to climate changes, Hoffellsj√∂kull has retreated a considerable distance. A deep lake is rapidly developing in the depression left behind, and will become constantly larger as the glacier retreats.  Research  The Hoffellsj√∂kull outlet glacier was the scene of extensive research by glaciologists in the early part of the 20th century. It was also used as an access point for research on the Vatnaj√∂kull ice cap. One of the most famous expeditions was directed by the Icelandic meteorologist J√≥n Ey√æ√≥rsson and the Swedish glaciologist Hans Wilhelmsson Ahlmann in 1936. Two geography students who accompanied them later became well known: Carl Mannerfelt in Swedish business and Sigur√∞ur √û√≥rarinsson in Icelandic geological research. Studies carried out by this group demonstrated that Vatnaj√∂kull receives much more precipitation than most glaciers elsewhere in the world, and also produces more meltwater. This means that the water cycle on the south side of Vatnaj√∂kull is extremely rapid, greater than in most other glacial systems in the world. Indeed, the central part of Hoffellsj√∂kull was shown by other measurements to achieve a sliding speed of about two metres per day, with recent research confirming this speed.

It was developed by Rick Davies as part of his PhD associated the monitoring and evaluation of a rural development program in Bangladesh. At that time Davies named it \\"the evolutionary approach to organizational learning\\". Later Jess Dart experimented with MSC as part of her PhD and in 2000 Davies and Dart coined the term \\"Most Significant Change Technique\\" and wrote the User guide. This relatively new method is based on a qualitative, participatory approach, with stakeholders involved in all aspects of the evaluation and is therefore a shift away from conventional quantitative, expert driven evaluation methods toward a qualitative participant driven approach, focusing on the human impact of interventions. In essence, MSC involves the generation of significant change stories by various stakeholders involved in the intervention. These are stories of significant changes caused by the intervention. The more significant of these stories are then selected by the stakeholders and in depth discussions of these stories take place. These discussions bring to the stakeholders attention the impacts of the intervention that have the most significant effects on the lives of the beneficiaries.Rick Davies,Jess Dart The Most Significant Change (MSC) Technique: A Guide to Its Use (2005) Steps involved in the most significant change process There are 10 steps involved in the most significant change process # Starting and raising interest # Defining the domains of change # Defining the reporting period # Collecting significant change stories # Selecting the most significant of these stories # Feeding back the results of the selection process # Verification of stories # Quantification # Secondary analysis and meta- monitoring # Revising the system Benefits and limitations of the MSC technique =Benefits= The focus is on learning rather than accountability. This means that the evaluation managers, as well as the field workers are forced to reflect on and openly question the intervention programme and their interactions with the community in which the intervention takes place. It is also able to inform other M&E; processes, identifying the significant aspects of the intervention to allow for more quantitative evaluation processes. In addition, the process gives the evaluators a heightened sensitivity to the beneficiaries, which it could be argued, is more conducive to successful outcomes. =Limitations= Although the impact of the evaluation emerge in stories gathered from the community and other stakeholders, only certain individuals can be part of the story generation process. It is inevitable that some stories will not be considered and that the stories may not necessarily be representative of the entire community‚Äôs feelings. It is often the marginalised people within a society that are under- represented, and their significant stories may differ from those less marginalised people. A second issue that has been identified is the generation of socially desirable stories by the community members. In addition, the community members may not understand the concept of a significant change story which may lead to valueless data. The terminology can cause confusion as in statistics and quantitative evaluation methods, the term ‚Äòsignificance‚Äô is linked with ‚Äòstatistical significance‚Äô. Usage MSC is now widely used by development aid agencies, especially NGOs. The original MSC Guide has since been translated into 13 languages (Arabic, Bangla, French, Hindi, Bahasa Indonesian, Japanese, Malayalam, Russian, Sinhala, Tamil, Spanish and Urdu), typically by organisations working within those language groups. Since 2000 there has been an active and global \\"community of practice\\" that shares experiences with the use of MSC in different settings. As of 2013 the MSC egroup has 1640 members. Members have accumulated a collection of more than 80 documents describing the use of MSC across 28 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas References Evaluation methods ","title":"Most significant change technique"},{"id":"37059330","text":"is a 4-panel manga series created by Rui Tamachi revolving around anthropomorphised cockroaches.

The site is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Key Wildlife Sites Location and habitat The bog lies in the heart of the Forest of Dean, and is separated from the Woorgreens Lake and Marsh nature reserve by the B4226. The site has been a nature reserve since 1977, and represents the remains of an ancient acid bog which historically covered this area. This is one of the rarest habitats in the county. It is in the Coal Measures (in a depression), is on alluvium and fed by a stream from the north. The water levels are controlled by sluice, and are linked to the Woorgreens Lake and Marsh reserve. The reserve is a significant example of a sphagnum bog and also supports a wide range of lichens. These grow on the trees and exposed rocks. This is a sheltered site though open in aspect. History The oak woodland which surrounds the bog was planted c. 1860. There were two attempts to sink two mining pits in the 1830s and to construct an embankment to the west. This did not come to fruition and was part of a plan to construct a railway which also failed. There was a threat in 1978 from a proposed Woorgreens open-cast mine proposal which was averted. This would have affected the water supply. The outcome was the control system now operating for the water levels between the two reserves. There is a drainage channel running through the centre of Foxes Bridge Bog. Flora There is a diverse range of bog and marshland plants recorded. These include marsh St John's-wort which is the only known occurrence in Gloucestershire. Species such as marsh violet, slender tufted- sedge, common cotton-grass and marsh pennywort flourish. Other species such as lesser spearwort, cuckooflower and ragged robin are present. Historical recordings for the site include bog pimpernel and two types of sundew. There are old silver birch, alder and willow towards the south of the bog. Invertebrates The presence of marsh violets makes the bog an ideal supportive habitat for the uncommon small pearl-bordered fritillary. Dragonflies are in abundance similar to the adjacent Woorgreens Lake and Marsh reserve. Records include broad-bodied chaser and the large red damselfly. Fauna Fallow deer are known to use the site and the area is grazed by the forest sheep. Conservation This is an area which is managed to control encroaching species to conserve and to increase the bog flora.

This collection of data uses a longitudinal technique, meaning participants are studied over a period of time. This research tool, although not being able to provide results as detailed as a true field study, can still offer a vast amount of contextual information without the costs of a true field study. Diary studies are also known as experience sampling or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology. Traditionally diary studies involved participants keeping a written diary of events. However the emergence of smartphones now enables participants to diary with photos, videos and text using a variety of online or offline apps and tools. Since the diary studies are recorded sequentially over time, it can be used to investigate time-based phenomena, temporal dynamics, and fluctuating phenomena such as moods. Diary studies can also be employed together with other research techniques within a mixed method framework and is particularly useful in obtaining rich subjective data. For instance, experience sampling method (ESM) combines it with questionnaires to gather data and examine people's experiences in daily life. History An early example of a diary study was \\"How Workingmen Spend Their Time\\" (Bevans, 1913) which went unpublished by George Esdras Bevans.\\"Bevans, G.E. (1913). How Workingmen Spend Their Time (Unpublished Doctoral Thesis). Columbia University, New York, NY\\" Background Diary studies originate from the fields of psychology and anthropology. In the field of human‚Äìcomputer interaction (HCI), diary studies have been adopted as one method of learning about user needs towards designing more appropriate technologies.Palen, L., & Salzman, M. (2002). Voice-mail diary studies for naturalistic data capture under mobile conditions. In Proceedings of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW '02), pp. 87‚Äì95. New York: ACM. = Temporal processes in diary studies = A key characteristic of diary studies is their ability to track daily events over time. Researchers have begun conducting studies that allow them to explore the connection between a previous day's events and a current day's outcome, or to what extent prior events make people responsive to current events. Researchers Robert E. Wickham and C. Raymond Knee have concluded that future research studies would benefit from evaluating temporal processes, or processes related to time, in diary studies. This would serve as a way for researchers to test unique questions and hypotheses. = Evaluating in-person change in diary = Researchers have been able to use diary studies to evaluate how people can change over time. Traditional diary studies have evaluated change between individuals, but new studies have been conducted to evaluate within-person changes using diary studies. Through a framework of the generalizability theory, researchers have used a condensed version of the Profile of Mood States (POMS) to study within-person emotional changes via diaries.  Types of diary studies  = Feedback studies = Feedback studies involve participants answering predefined questions about the phenomenon of interest in a natural setting, with the answers acting as a diary entry. This is usually at assigned times, frequencies, or occurrences of the phenomenon, stated by the researcher. The most common method is using ‚Äòpaper and pencil‚Äô, although there are some studies that both utilise and suggest other technologies such as mobile phones or Psion Organisers. As such, feedback studies involve asynchronous communication between the participants and the researchers, as the participants‚Äô data is recorded in their diary first, and then passed on to the researchers once complete. Feedback studies are scalable - that is, a large-scale sample can be used, since it is mainly the participants themselves who are responsible for collecting and recording data. = Elicitation studies = In elicitation studies, participants capture media as soon as the phenomenon occurs - the media is usually in the form of a photograph, but can be in other different forms as well, and so the recording is generally quick and less effortful than feedback studies. These media are then used as prompts and memory cues - to elicit memories and discussion - in interviews that take place much later. As such, elicitation studies involve synchronous communication between the participants and the researchers, usually through interviews. In these later interviews, the media and other memory cues (such as what activities were done before and after the event) can improve participants‚Äô episodic memory. In particular, photos were found to elicit more specific recall than all other media types. = Comparisons = There are two prominent trade-offs between each type of study. Feedback studies involve answering questions more frequently and in situ, therefore enabling more accurate recall but more effortful recording. In contrast, elicitation studies involve quickly capturing media in situ but answering questions much later, therefore enabling less effortful recording but potentially inaccurate recall.  When to use diary studies  Diary studies are most often used when observing behavior over time in a natural environment. They can be beneficial when one is looking to find new qualitative and quantitative data. Advantages Advantages of diary studies are numerous.Lallemand, C. (2012). Dear Diary: Using Diaries to Study User ExperienceUX Magazine 11.3, August 2012. They allow: * collecting longitudinal and temporal information; * reporting events and experiences in context and in-the-moment; * participants to diary their behaviours, thoughts and feelings in-the-moment thereby minimising the potential for post rationalisation; * determining the antecedents, correlations, and consequences of daily experiences and behaviors. Limitations There are some limitations of diary studies, mainly due to their characteristics of reliance on memory and self- report measures. There is low control, low participation and there is a risk of disturbing the action. In feedback studies, it can be troubling and disturbing to write everything down.Kuniavsky, Observing the User Experience, A Practitioner's Guide to User Research September 21, 2012, . = Inaccurate recall = The validity of diary studies rests on the assumption that participants will accurately recall and record their experiences. This is somewhat more easily enabled by the fact that diaries are completed & media is captured in a natural environment and closer, in real-time, to any occurrences of the phenomenon of interest. However, there are multiple barriers to obtaining accurate data, such as: * Social desirability bias - where participants may answer in a way that makes them appear more socially desirable. This may be more prominent in longitudinal studies where participants frequently communicate with researchers. * Recall bias - where participants recall events or feelings inaccurately due to systematic errors. Human memory is unreliable, as it is an active reconstruction which is susceptible to errors and biases. For example, after recording their emotions in daily diaries, older adults tended to recall more positive emotions than younger adults, while younger adults tended to recall more negative emotions than older adults. * The phenomenon of interest itself - participants may find it difficult to both record and experience the phenomenon accurately at the same time. For example, a diary study assessing the drinking urges of recently treated alcoholics found that, if/when participants began to drink alcohol, they tended to stop recording in their diary. = Non-compliance and retrospective entries = Diary studies tend to dictate specific times or a frequency at which the participant should complete their diary entries or capture media. This is usually a time that is close to the event or phenomenon of interest to the researcher, and it is assumed that participants will comply with these instructions. However, researchers often find it difficult to verify the extent to which this assumption is met, and have observed various forms of non-compliance. One example of this is hoarding, where previously- missed entries are 'backfilled' or completed all at once, therefore being completed retrospectively rather than at the assigned time. A further example of this is where entries are 'forward-filled', i.e. recorded for a future date. Researchers have found significant rates of non-compliance and entries written retrospectively in feedback studies. A study by Hyland and colleagues (1993) estimated that the percentage of errors in paper and pencil diaries could be anywhere from 2-24%, due to diaries written retrospectively and/or due to inaccuracies in recording. Another study by Stone and colleagues (2003) compared paper diaries versus compliance-enhancing electronic diaries. The paper diaries contained a hidden instrument which detected when the diary was opened - from this, actual compliance rate was found to be only 11%, while 79% of entries were faked, i.e. not written within 30 minutes of the assigned time. In contrast, the electronic diaries created timestamps for each entry, which prevented the possibility of fake timestamped entries, and therefore yielded a compliance rate of 94%.  Notable diary studies  In 2015, a diary study was conducted at a Dutch University of Applied Sciences to evaluate how learning spaces affect students' learning activities. 52 business management students kept records of the learning activities that they worked on, where they worked on them, and why they worked there for a week. Through evaluating the diary entries of this study, researchers found a significant correlation between the spaces in which students chose to work and their learning activities.

Life  Griesbacher was born in Egglham. He studied in Passau and was ordained a priest in 1886. From 1894 to 1895 he was music prefect at the Studienseminar (study seminary) St. Emmeram in Regensburg. Due to his reputation as a church composer, he was appointed in 1911 a lecturer at the Kirchenmusikschule Regensburg (School of Church Music) of Regensburg, where he taught counterpoint, musical form and stylistic. Around the same time he was appointed Vicar and then canon at the Collegiate St. Johann in Regensburg. In 1930 the chapter elected him dean. He temporarily was director, until Carl Thiel succeeded Karl Weinberger. He died in Regensburg of gastrointestinal cancer.  Work  Griesbacher composed predominantly Catholic church music. Based on the a cappella of the Cecilian Movement, he wrote works accompanied by the organ. When orchestra was added, he did not do the instrumentation himself. He tried to combine the strict Cecilian style with late romantic harmonies. His later works are characterised by a rather complex musical language. Griesbacher played a role in the transition of Catholic church music from the 19th to the 20th century. He created about 250 works, including 49 masses.

Background The Bristol Pound is a local, complementary, and/or community currency that was created to \\"improve Bristol's local economy\\". Its primary aim is to support independent traders in order to maintain diversity in business around the city. The scheme is a joint not-for-profit enterprise between Bristol Pound Community Interest Company and Bristol Credit Union. Previous to the Bristol Pound, local currencies were launched in the UK in Totnes (2006), Lewes (2008), Brixton (2009) and Stroud (2010). Effect on the local economy =Theory= Bristol Pound logo According to a 2002 New Economics Foundation publication, money that is re-spent locally is '... the same as attracting new money into that area.' If a person spends a pound at a local shop, the owner of this shop can re-spend it by buying supplies from another local business, or paying local taxes (Business Rates or Council Tax) to the Council. The process can be repeated with exchanges kept within the local economy. This local circulation can lead to additional economic benefits for the area; this is called the local multiplier effect. In comparison, Sterling Pounds spent at a supermarket chain typically leads to more than 80% of the money leaving the area almost immediately. As well as potentially stimulating the local economy it can create stronger bonds within the community; by increasing social capital. Buying locally can decrease emissions as locally produced good require less transportation. Local trade through the use of complementary currencies can be a resilience strategy; reducing impact of national economic crises and dependency on international trade, and enhancing self-sufficiency. It can also increase the awareness of the impact of one's economic activity. =Research= In 2017, the Bristol Post reported on some research that suggested the Bristol Pound venture is too small to affect significant change in localism and has not increased local wealth or the production. A spokesperson for the Bristol Pound claimed the findings contradicted previous research by the University of Bristol. Usage Bristol is the first city in the UK in which taxes and business rates can be paid in Bristol Pounds. Bristol Pound account holders can convert ¬£Bs to and from pounds sterling at a 1:1 ratio. Bristol City Council, and other organisations in the city, offer their employees the option to take part of their salaries in Bristol Pounds. The former Mayor of Bristol, George Ferguson, accepted his entire salary (¬£51,000) in Bristol Pounds. Since June 2015 energy bills can be paid in Bristol Pounds to the 100% renewable energy provider, Good Energy. Its CEO claimed it is a world first for paying energy bills using a local currency. In June 2015, according to the Bristol Pound CEO, some ¬£1 million had been issued in ¬£Bs, with more than ¬£B700,000 still in circulation. More than 800 businesses accept Bristol Pounds and more than a thousand users have a Bristol Pound account. By late 2017, five million Bristol Pounds had been spent. In March 2020, the Bristol Post reported that the currency faced an uncertain future and quoted managers as reporting potential closure of the initiative. The local newspaper reported that the reach of the currency had substantially diminished. Organisation and partnerships The Bristol Pound is managed by the non-profit Bristol Pound Community Interest Company in collaboration with the local financial institution, the Bristol Credit Union. The Bristol Credit Union ensures that every ¬£1 sterling converted to a printed ¬£B1 is backed in a secure trust fund. The scheme is supported by Bristol City Council, although the council had substantially reduced any financial support from 2018. Lately Bristol Pound in involved in the Digipay4Growth project, coordinated by the Social Trade organisation and with partners such as Sardex. Through this project Bristol Pounds is involved in the digitalisation of its currency, using Cyclos software. Bristol Pound is part of a larger international movement of local currencies. The European funded Community Currencies in Action partnership provided support for communities which want to develop their new currency and works on innovations. Within the UK, Bristol Pound CIC founded and maintains the Guild of Independent Currencies ‚Äì a platform for sharing experiences about local currencies. In this framework, Bristol CIC is currently working with Exeter, amongst others, helping it to launch its own local currency; the Exeter Pound. Using the Bristol Pound The Bristol Pounds can be used in both paper and electronic format, like conventional money. One Bristol Pound is equivalent to one Sterling Pound. Some businesses apply discounts for customers paying in Bristol Pounds. Local taxes and electricity bills can be paid with Bristol Pounds online. Paper Bristol Pounds Paper ¬£Bs can be used by anyone, have been designed by Bristolians, and carry many high security features to prevent fraud. In June 2015 new paper ¬£Bs were issued. These can be exchanged at a 1:1 rate for sterling at seventeen different cash points throughout the city, or ordered online through the Bristol Pound website. Electronic payments The Bristol Pound was the second local scheme (after the Brixton Pound) to be able to accept electronic payments in the UK. This allows, for example, participating small businesses to accept payments by SMS, without needing to pay for and install a credit card machine. The businesses are charged 2% of the amount billed for payments made by SMS, a similar or sometimes reduced rate than with credit or debit cards, or PayPal (3%). Payments can also be made online, with the recipient of each payment charged at a rate of 1%, capped at 95p per transaction. Legality Every paper ¬£B is backed up by a pound sterling deposited at Bristol Credit Union. The Bristol Pound is not legal tender, and participation is therefore voluntary. The directors of the scheme cannot prevent national and multinational companies accepting paper ¬£Bs, but can decide, based on the Rules of Membership, whether a business is permitted to open a Bristol Pound account and trade electronically. Bristol Pounds can only be exchanged back into pounds sterling via an electronic Bristol Pound account. There is no fee for doing this. Paper Bristol Pounds cannot be directly exchanged back to sterling unless first deposited into an electronic account. Technically, the notes are vouchers and the first issue of the paper Bristol Pounds also have an expiry date (30 September 2015). The Bank of England acknowledges the existence and role of local currencies. Awards Bristol Pound contributed to Bristol being awarded the title of European Green Capital 2015.

Life Zehm was born in Neusalz in Lower Silesia. He received first piano lessons by the composer in Stettin when he was 8 years old. In 1941, he began studies at the Mozarteum in Salzburg with Walter Lampe (composer) (piano) and Friedrich Frischenschlager (theory). He continued after the war at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Freiburg with Harald Genzmer (composition) and Edith Picht-Axenfeld (piano). From 1952 to 1956, he worked as a private music teacher, pianist and composer, from 1956 to 1963 he was responsible for music at the Amerika-Haus in Freiburg, and from 1963 to 1985 as an editor and for the music publishing house Schott in Mainz. He died on 4 December 2007 in Wiesbaden.  Work  His career as a composer spanned from 1950 to 2007. He wrote some 200 works, focused on chamber music. He also wrote vocal music, especially songs and song cycles. He composed orchestral works, concertos, music for piano, organ and harpsichord, a few works for theater, radio plays and film, educational literature, works for school orchestras and amateur orchestras. He published arrangements of international folklore under a pen name. As a student of Harald Genzmer and in the wake of Paul Hindemith, Bart√≥k and Stravinsky, Zehm composed in extended tonality. His music includes elements of avant-garde, connected to traditional formal elements. His music shows formally clear and concise structure, using traditional forms such as fugue and rondo, catchy, concise and rhythmically profiled themes, and dancing rhythm. He composed Grasshoffiade, four songs on lyrics by Fritz Grasshoff for men's choir.

The aircraft was en route from Br√∏nn√∏ysund Airport, Br√∏nn√∏y to Norne, an offshore Floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO). The accident was caused by a fatigue crack in a spline of a power transmission shaft connector, which ultimately caused the power transmission shaft to fail. All twelve people on board were killed in the crash. Aircraft The accident aircraft was an AS332 L1 Super Puma helicopter, manufactured by Eurocopter (now named Airbus Helicopters), registration LN-OPG.  Background  At 06:00 a.m. local time (UTC+2), Helikopter Service Flight 451 took off from Br√∏nn√∏ysund Airport with two pilots and ten passengers, heading for the Statoil operated FPSO Norne. The route was a daily shuttle due to lack of accommodation on Norne during the busy period when the vessel was under commissioning. Accident The flight proceeded as normal until 06:50:07 hours when the engine overspeed light was observed for a short time. The co-pilot read out the corresponding information from the emergency checklist, before they continued the approach to land on Norne. At 06:52:41 hours the crew contacted Transocean Prospect, the oil platform that was handling radio communication with helicopters landing on Norne. At 06:54:42 hours they informed Bod√∏ ATCC that they were leaving 2,000 ft., with an estimated time of arrival of 07:05 hours. According to the helicopter's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the abnormal indications recurred at 06:55:37 hours before \\"something strange\\" was observed at 06:55:55 hours. A thud was heard at 06:56:30 hours; then, after a loud crunching sound 1.7 seconds later, the crew lost control over the aircraft. The helicopter fell to the sea from around 1,800 ft. and all on board were killed as a result of the impact. The wreckage sank and came to rest at a depth of 830 meters. All twelve people on board were killed in the crash.  Summary of investigation findings  Following their investigation of the accident, the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) concluded that the cause of the accident was multiple fatigue cracks in the splined sleeve between the high-speed bendix shaft and the right-hand engine, which had caused damage to the engine overspeed protection system. The splined sleeve disintegrated, severing the high-speed shaft, which led to an overspeed of the right-hand power turbine which in turn burst, destroying the left-hand engine as well as to cutting control rods which made the helicopter uncontrollable. The crew could not be expected to have been sufficiently knowledgeable about the aircraft's control system to understand the seriousness of the intermittent overspeed alarm, and there were no procedures or checklists available that covered this scenario. The AIBN also found reason to believe that one of the HUMS accelerometers installed in the aircraft would have been able to alert maintenance crew about the change in vibration patterns in time to avoid the accident had it been serviceable since it was configured with a setpoint value. Retrospective analysis of HUMS data showed that vibrations at the location where this accelerometer was mounted were above the setpoint value before the accident. The part of HUMS that was serviceable stored relevant information, but those data had to be retrieved by maintenance staff and analyzed between flights. At the time of the accident, usage of HUMS in offshore helicopters was in an early phase and not required by regulations. The cracks had been developing slowly for several days before the catastrophic failure occurred, and if HUMS data had been systematically retrieved and analyzed between flights the change in vibration patterns might have been discovered by maintenance staff before the fatal flight. Regulation of HUMS in offshore helicopters was one of 18 recommendations in the final AIBN report. The AIBN report and the unrealized potential of HUMS in avoiding this accident was discussed at the 2003 HUMS Conference in Melbourne and was described as \\"a defining moment\\" for HUMS in offshore helicopter operations.

It was built in neo-Gothic style and consecrated in 1900 as a parish church. It became a cathedral in 1994, due to the reorganisation of East German dioceses.  History  The church was built in the years 1898 to 1900 and consecrated on 6 October 1900. G√∂rlitz was then part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Breslau (elevated to Metropolia in 1930 and renamed Wroc≈Çaw in 1972). It was originally planned to be the second church of the parish Hl. Kreuz (Holy Cross). Bishop Adolf Bertram made it the church of the new parish of St. Jakobus in 1918. In March 1947, in result of World War II, G√∂rlitz served as the exile seat of the Breslau Metropolitan Chapter headed by Vicar Capitular , whom the Polish authorities had expelled from Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau) on 9 July 1946 to the British zone of occupation, but who in 1947 managed to return to the western part of the archdiocese then in the Soviet Occupation zone of Germany. Since October 1945 the Breslau archdiocesan ordinariate ran a branch office in G√∂rlitz, first responsible for the Soviet zone archdiocesan territory, which became the head office (Erzbisch√∂fliches Amt, i.e. Archdiocesan Office) after the chapter and other administrative staff had been expelled from Wroc≈Çaw. The Archdiocese of Breslau remained in existence de jure, however, de facto this only applied to the archdiocesan territory in the Soviet Zone, which remained represented by Piontek at the Fulda Conference of Bishops. While the Polish- annexed greater part of the Breslau archdiocese came under the jurisdiction of Apostolic Administrators first appointed by August Hlond (as of 1 September 1945), the Czechoslovak part of Breslau archdiocese became a separate Apostolic Administration of ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n in 1947. St. James was the cathedral for the Breslau archdiocesan territory in the Soviet Zone, which became the East German Democratic Republic in 1949. With the Holy See's dissolution of Breslau's Eastern German Ecclesiastical Province and the reorganisation of the archdiocese and its suffragans in 1972 (cf. Apostolic constitution Vratislaviensis ‚Äì Berolinensis et aliarum), the Polish bulk of Breslau's archdiocesan area became the Archdiocese of Wroc≈Çaw, whereas the East German part of Breslau archdiocese was disentangled from the archdiocese and made the exempt Apostolic Administration of G√∂rlitz with St. James converted to procathedral (as of 1972). By the reorganisation of the dioceses in Northern and Middle Germany in the early 1990s the G√∂rlitz Apostolic Administration was upgraded to diocese in 1994 and St. James became its cathedral. It also serves as the parish church for the St. Jakobus congregation.  Architecture  The neo-Gothic hall church in brick construction with the 68-foot tower stands on a hill and is therefore visible from afar. During the last days of World War II, the church was badly damaged by artillery fire. It was restored, with a simplified structure of the spire without spire lights. Only fragments of the original wall paintings and ornamental glazed tiles survived. Restoration of the four small side towers, the roof structures and the frieze from yellow and red tiles was planned to be completed in 2012.  Features  = Bells = The four bells are named after St. James, St. Benedict, St. Mary and St. Boniface. After the destruction during World War II, steel yokes were erected in 1963. When they showed fatigue cracks three of the bells were temporarily stopped. All bells have been put back into service after restoration in July 2012. = Organ = St. Jakobus Cathedral The organ was built from 1988 to 1989 by with three manuals and 47 registers.

After the anticipation comes the action and the reaction. Anticipation is one of the fundamental 12 basic principles of animation, as set out by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston in their authoritative 1981 book on the Disney Studio titled The Illusion of Life. An anticipation pose or drawing is a preparation for the main action of an animated scene, as distinct from the action and the reaction. Definition \\"Early on at the Disney Studio the animators learned that audiences\\" could not easily follow the animation unless there was a \\"planned series of events\\" leading the eye.Johnston & Thomas, p.51 Therefore, in order to prepare the audience for an action, the animators would add a so-called anticipation drawing, allowing the audience to anticipate the main action in the scene. This would also help to make the action appear more realistic. For example, a man preparing to run fast would crouch down, \\"gathering like a spring\\" for the main action. This is called the anticipation for the main action. Equally, a golfer making a swing has to anticipate the swing by swinging the club back first, just as a baseball pitcher must \\"wind up\\" before throwing the ball.Johnston & Thomas, p.52 This technique was borrowed from the theatre, and was important in holding the audience's attention. The audience might not know exactly why a character was doing something, but they would at least know what he was doing (or what he was about to do). The technique can also be used for less physical actions, such as a character looking off-screen to anticipate someone's arrival, or attention focusing on an object that a character is about to pick up.Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 51‚Äì2. At the Disney studio, Walt Disney pushed his animators to improve their work, and he was especially insistent that visual gags should be clear, wishing to make sure that the audience could always see everything clearly so they could anticipate what was going to happen. He called this technique \\"aiming,\\" and would act out actions himself, exaggerating them so that the animators could clearly capture the effect.Johnston & Thomas, p.53 Les Clark, one of Disney's most talented animators, and later one of Disney's Nine Old Men later said of this discovery, \\"Today it may look simple to us; at the time it wasn't. It was something that hadn't been tried before or proved.\\" Johnston & Thomas, p.53 By contrast, the anticipation pose can also be omitted in cases where it might be expected. The resulting sense of anticlimax will produce a feeling of surprise in the viewer, and can often add comedy to a scene. This is often referred to as a 'surprise gag'.Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 52.

Within a few days Koukamas was arrested and was to be executed. Held in a Famagusta military jail, Koukoumas was on a list of 2000 left wingers that EOKA B planned to kill, but he was saved by the Turkish invasion when his captors realised they needed every soldier that they could muster if they were to repel the Turkish invasion. Because of this reprieve Koukoumas found himself in the front line. After the war like 200,000 other Greek Cypriots, he and his family became refugees moving to the south of the Green Line as Angastina the village they lived in was occupied by Turkish forces.

In some sources, it is mentioned as early as the year 1141. The first definite mention is in the Codex Falkensteinensis in 1170. Ludwig van Beethoven dedicated two Lieder to the ruin. History In 1486, the castle was captured by king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. After this period, it was managed by imperial guardians; from 1603 to 1672 it was owned by the Hei√üperger family, and afterwards by the Dietrichstein family.

Since the first event in 1979 in Los Angeles, California, USA, the conference has evolved into one of the major forums for research on conceptual modeling and information retrieval. Conceptual modeling is about describing the semantics of software applications at a high level of abstraction. Specifically, conceptual modelers (1) describe structure models in terms of entities, relationships, and constraints; (2) describe behavior or functional models in terms of states, transitions among states, and actions performed in states and transitions; and (3) describe interactions and user interfaces in terms of messages sent and received and information exchanged. In their typical usage, conceptual-model diagrams are high-level abstractions that enable clients and analysts to understand one another, enable analysts to communicate successfully with application programmers, and in some cases automatically generate (parts of) the software application.  Topics  *Entity-relationship model *Entity-relationship diagram *Conceptual schema design *Model-driven software development *Model-driven architecture (MDA) *Unified Modeling Language (UML) *Extended or Enhanced entity‚Äìrelationship model *Object-role modeling *Process modeling *Business process modeling *Workflow Design *Foundational theory of conceptual models and conceptual modeling Peter Chen Award Peter P. Chen Award Initiated by Elsevier in 2008 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the journal, Data and Knowledge Engineering, the Peter P.

It was the last flamethrower tank used in American military service.  Background and development  The M67's predecessor, an M4A3R3 used by the USMC during the Battle of Iwo Jima. A prototype T67 at Aberdeen Proving Ground on 5 November 1953. U.S. Army M67A1 at Fort Knox in June 1961. Cross-section of the M67's turret.

Former Marine Corps M67A2's in storage at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow in the 1970s. M67A1 on display at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri in 2009. Drawing on the experiences of crews of M4 Sherman tanks that were converted into flamethrower tanks and used during World War II, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps began work on a successor tank that could deliver the terrifying presence of a flame tank onto the battlefields of the Cold War. Work on the design took place between 1952 and 1954, utilizing a modified M48 tank chassis, at the initiative of the US Marine Corps. Production commenced in 1955 and ran for either a single year or four, depending on some estimates. A total of 109 M67 tanks were produced for the Marine Corps and US Army.  Service history  The M67 was primarily used for mop-up style operations, and like all flamethrower tanks, it was intended to be used primarily against infantry. The \\"Zippo\\" featured no main cannon; the M48's 90mm gun was replaced with the tank's flamethrower. While firing in quick bursts, the M67's firing was described as appearing as \\"rods of flames\\". The swirling motion of the flames produced could reach around corners. The natural fear of being burned to death gave an added shock factor to the M67. The M67 remained in service until 1974, when it was retired from use without a replacement. The modern-day United States military has no flamethrower tanks in service.

The majority stake in the mine is owned by InterGen Australia.  History  Since 2000, the engineering company Downer EDI Mining has been operating the Commodore Mine. In September 2014, Downer EDI Mining renewed its contract to manage the mine for 5 more years for $250 million. In September 2018, Downer EDI Mining renewed its contract to manage the mine for 5 more years for $286 million.  Description  Situated around 200 kilometers west of Brisbane in Queensland's Surat Basin, the Commodore Mine is adjacent to the 850 mega-watt coal-fired Millmerran Power Station, to which the mine is the only source of coal fuel supply, having made its first delivery there in February 2003. The Commodore mine employs about 50 staff onsite in total. Almost half the total workforce has been employed from the local community. The mine's geology is made up of gently folded Walloon coal measures of middle Jurassic age, dipping generally at less than three degrees. Three banded seams are visible: Kooroongarra (up to 3 metres thick), Commodore (averaging 5.2metres thick) and Bottom Rider (between 0.5metres and 0.9metres thick). The mine operates on biodiesel fuel, and developed a system that independently verifies fugitive methane gas emissions. By 1 January 1999, Commodore had a thermal coal resource of 177Mt. The mine produced 3.250Mt to 31 December 2005, and has roughly 3.6Mtpa production capacity. The mine is operated by Downer EDI Mining.

Women's football in India is growing in popularity in spite of the apathetic attitude of the All India Football Federation, and the governing body's inability to provide sufficient funds for the game. History Women's football has not had the relative advantage in the sport that the men's game has had, and also has not become as prevalent in the country as its male counterpart. The game was administered by the Women's Football Federation of India (WFFI) from 1975 until the early 1990s, when they were absorbed into the AIFF. However, there are complaints that women's football is treated as a poor relation to the men's game, leading to (unfulfilled) plans to de-merge the WFFI. The women's game, like the men's game, also has its early pioneers in the state of West Bengal. The large Kolkata teams, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, started women's club sides in the 2000‚Äì01 season, and they participate with other teams in the Calcutta Women's Football League. However, it has been seen recently that players from Odisha and Manipur have made advances in the game. Players from these two states make up a large part of the India women's national football team. The women's national competition is played on a state vs. state basis in the India women's football championship. There are also similar national championships for junior teams like the Junior Girls National Championship (for under 19s) and the Under-17 Girls National Championship. Some female players have become internationally recognised. Among them are Chitra Gangadharan who was selected to play for the All Asian Star team. Jaanki Kotecha was selected as captain to the All Asian Star Team in 2008‚Äì2009, where she led her team to victory. In February 2000, Sujata Kar and Alpana Sil became the first Indian footballers to sign a contract outside India. They signed with the German team TSV Crailsheim, but had to return after a month due to problems with the clearance of their international transfer. Until 1983, women's football took part in international tournaments like the AFC Women's Asian Cup. For example, the team won silver in 1980 at Calicut. In later years it had become poor in status just like its male counterpart. During the 2003 AFC Women's Championship, the Indian team were embarrassed by a 12‚Äì0 defeat to China. The poor support of the national team by the AIFF became evident, when the team's trip to Germany was only made possible by Non Resident Indians in the country, and by the support of the German Football Association. Furthermore, championships are held in remote locations, and national media coverage is said to be restricted to state and local newspapers. The women's game reached a new low in June 2009 when FIFA delisted the side from its world rankings for being out of action for more than 18 months. This comes at a time when the game was gaining in popularity amongst the younger generation as evident by the local leagues conducted around the country. The recently concluded Mumbai Women's Football League 2009‚Äì10 organised by the MDFA (Mumbai District Football Association) was a major success and featured many talented players who had played for the national team. Furthermore, the popularity of the event gave hope that the women's game could rise in India. One of the barriers to the sport growing is that many women experience prejudice for playing the sport. On 17 December 2014, General Secretary of the All India Football Federation, Kushal Das, gave a presentation on the future of women's football in India during a meeting with FIFA. During his presentation, Das stated that the goal for women's football from 2014 to 2017 was to increase the ranking of the India senior team to the top 40s and the top 8 in Asia, start a professional women's league by 2015, and to qualify for both the U19 and U16 versions of the AFC championships. National Competition  Over the years the Indian Women's Football Championship has been the major championship among state teams. On 21 April 2016, over a year after the AIFF started plans for a women's football league, the AIFF President, Praful Patel, said that a women's football league would kick off in October 2016 with six teams to be decided, with the goal to expand to eight teams by 2017. Just over two months later, on 5 July 2016, the AIFF organized a workshop to discuss the India women's national team and discuss the proposed women's football league. Five Indian Super League sides (Delhi Dynamos, Chennaiyin FC, Kerala Blasters, FC Pune City, Atletico de Kolkata) and three I-League teams (Bengaluru FC, Aizawl FC, Mumbai FC) attended the workshop. It was announced that the league would feature the eight teams in the league and two other spots would be determined through a pre-qualification round. On 14 October, the AIFF announced that the preliminary rounds for the Indian Women's League would begin on 17 October 2016 in which ten teams are split into two groups of five teams each, with the winner from each group qualifying for the national finals. 12 clubs participated for the 4th season of Indian Women's League. State women's leagues organized by various state federations acted as the qualifier this season. In addition to these, the Rest of India zone champions has been awarded a place in the final round. Gokulam Kerala defeated FC Alakhpura 9‚Äì1 over two legs to secure a place in the Group stage. National team The India women's national football team, organised by the All India Football Federation, was revived after being dormant for several years.

He was designated to replace outgoing Ambassador Uichiro Niwa, a former chairman of Itochu. Nishimiya's appointment came at a critical time in relations between China and Japan due to an escalation in tensions over the Senkaku Islands dispute and the ongoing 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations. Ambassador Nishimiya collapsed outside of his home shortly after his appointment. He died unexpectedly at a hospital in Tokyo on September 16, 2012, at the age of 60. Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba held a press conference to acknowledge the loss of Nishimiya.

The film had its International premiere at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival in 2012. Plot Jacky Bonnot (Micha√´l Youn) is a young Frenchman living with his pregnant girlfriend (Rapha√´lle Agogu√©). After being fired from a restaurant, he becomes worried about the birth of his child and decides to get any job he can despite his passion for haute cuisine. After accepting a job as a painter, he makes friends with the establishment's cooks and helps them improve their menu. These improvements eventually reach the ears of Alexandre Lagarde (Jean Reno), who is also in a precarious situation: as the renowned chef of the Cargo Lagarde restaurant, he has to improve his entire menu. If he cannot achieve this, the place will lose a star from its rating and Stanislas Matter (Julien Boisselier) will convert it into a molecular kitchen, with Alexandre and all the cooks losing their jobs. Jacky initially rejects the offer to work with Alexandre, because the position is an unpaid internship, but after hesitation, he accepts. The next day, both Jacky and Alexandre start cooking together but as soon as they begin, Jacky's finickiness and Alexandre's stubbornness leads to an argument that results in Jacky being fired. Alexandre regrets his decision and sends someone to search and take Jacky back to the Cargo Lagarde ranks. They reconcile and start to plan improvements to the restaurant's menu. As Jacky works as an unpaid intern, he lies to his girlfriend about searching for jobs. However, she goes to where he started as a painter and finds herself in the kitchen of the interns, who are having a video call with Jacky. She discovers him lying and their relationship breaks down. Alexandre offers him a glass of wine that Jacky accepts, and they keep tasting bottles of wine until both of them become slightly drunk. Alexandre tells Jacky that food critics that prefer molecular cuisine will be dining soon at his restaurant and it will result in a loss of one star from his restaurants rating. Jacky, drunk, calls his friend Juan for help. Jacky plans to reconcile with his girlfriend with the help of Alexandre, but the plan fails as she gets mad at his clumsy proposal. Alexandre offers Jacky a room in his house to spend the night, where Alexandre tries to talk with his daughter who is resentful over her dad's indifference to her thesis and degree.

The original Pouchel was constructed using three commercially available aluminium ladders, hence APEV is the Association pour la Promotion des Echelles Volantes, or in English, Association for the Promotion of Flying Ladders. Later models were forced to move to rectangular aluminium tubing when the ladder manufacturer grew concerned about liability.

The Pouchel series are all derivatives of the classic 1930s Henri Mignet- designed Mignet Pou-du-Ciel (Flying Flea). The Pouchel Light features a cantilever rear wing with a strut-braced parasol front wing, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted- together aluminum tubing.

In coordination with the local Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC), TMAS organizations also arrange for medevac to shore, emergency treatment at land facilities and the dispatch of medical personnel to ships with ill mariners. The rationale for TMAS services is that medical emergencies can occur while many days away from harbor and at prohibitively large distances from Search and Rescue bases, making immediate evacuation impractical or impossible. The ship's master is responsible for medical treatment at sea, and all commercial ships are required to possess minimal medical supplies. TMAS specialists diagnose cases using non-expert symptom descriptions and advise untrained personnel about emergency treatment given the available supplies and facilities. All seafaring nations are required by International Labour Organization/International Maritime Organization convention 163 of 1986 to set up a TMAS center that operates 24 hours a day. The center must be staffed by physicians trained in remote consultation and in the peculiarities of shipboard treatment to all civilian ships within their Search and Rescue Region (SRR).

The Encyclopedia Iranica notes that Western visitors commented on \\"the royal palace of NegƒÅrestƒÅn and salacious reports about its slide used for erotic purposes\\".Encyclopedia Iranica, France viii. Travelogues of the 18th-20th Centuries, citing J. de Pontev√®s de Sabran, Notes de voyage d'un hussard: un raid en Asie, Paris, 1888, pp. 138-40 Association with Fath-Ali Shah Qajar Fath-Ali Shah, creator of the marble slide, who is supposed to have felt the need to use it every day John H. Waller, commenting on Qajar Dynasty art, mentions, without any credible source, that such a slide was used by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar and his harem: > Beyond range of the artists' canvases were even jollier scenes; Fath Ali > Shah, it was said, happily whiled away the hours as, one by one, naked harem > beauties swooped down a slide, especially made for the sport, into the arms > of their lord and master before being playfully dunked in a pool.John H. > Waller, Beyond the Khyber Pass: the road to British disaster in the First > Afghan War, Random House, 1990, p. 59. The slide was described by Edward Granville Brown in his account of Negaristan Palace in Teheran: > a beautiful marble bath [is] furnished with a long smooth glissoire, called > by the Persians sursurak (\\"the slide\\"), which descends from above to the > very edge of the bath. Down this slope the numerous ladies of Fath-'Ali > Shah's harem used to slide into the arms of their lord, who was waiting > below to receive them.Edward Granville Brown, A Year Among the Persians: > Impressions as to the Life, Character, & Thought of the People of Persia, > Received During Twelve Months' Residence in that Country in the Years > 1887-1888, CUP Archive, 1926, p.105. The story circulated that the Shah lay on his back awaiting each of his many concubines. Ervand Abrahamian writes that according to legend, \\"Fath'ali did so every day naked so that his wives would slide down naked over him.\\"Ervand Abrahamian, A History of Modern Iran, South Asia Bulletin, Volume 28, Issue 2, South Asia Association, University of California, Los Angeles, 2008. Association with Naser al-Din Shah Naser al-Din, the Shah who is most popularly associated with the slide There is also no evidence that such a slide was used by other kings of the dynasty. Nonetheless, this type of slide has come to be known in Iran as \\"Naser al-Din Shah's slide\\" after Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, Fat‚Ä≤h-Ali Shah's great grandson. This may be because he reconstructed the Negarestan palace, where the most famous such slide was located.Hassan Azad, Posht-e pardeh- haye haramsala, Anzali Publication, Oromiyeh, 2003 Fred A. Reed says that the \\"late nineteenth-century Qajar tyrant\\" had \\"returned from Paris so enchanted with classical ballet that he dressed the women in his harem in short-skirted ballet costumes, then made them descend a long slide to his private quarters, the better to admire their frilled underwear.\\"Fred A. Reed, Persian Postcards: Iran After Khomeini, Talonbooks, 1994. p.147. R. Jackson Armstrong-Ingram already documented the impossibility of this 'ballet costume story' by pointing out that the short skirt was already in fashion at the court of the shah before his European journeys and by pointing out that the 'tutu' did not yet exist at the time of the shah's visits to European theatres in 1873.R. Jackson Armstrong-Ingram, 'The Shah, the Skirt, and the Ballet: A Menage √† Trois, or Just Ill-Founded Gossip', in: L.A. Ferydoun Barjesteh van Waalwijk van Doorn (ed.), Qajar Studies. Journal of the International Qajar Studies Association volume IV, Rotterdam, Santa Barbara, Tehran 2004, pp. 91-107. Another version of the story is given by Harry De Windt in his 1891 book A Ride to India Across Persia and Baluchistan, also associating a pool slide with Naser al-Din Shah. De Wint says that the slide was alabaster and that the Shah invented a sport in which he would \\"gravely slide into the water followed by his seraglio. The sight must have been a strange one, the costumes on those occasions, to say the least of it, scanty!\\"De Windt, Harry, A Ride to India Across Persia and Baluchistan, 1891, p. 98. In culture The adventure novelist Richard Henry Savage includes it in his novel Lost Countess Falka, in which the Shah, \\"a cold-eyed, sensual autocrat\\", indulges himself at the harems where \\"the glowing naiads were sporting on the marble slide which led their tempting nakedness into the perfumed crystal waters!\\".Richard Henry Savage, Lost Countess Falka: A Tale of the Orient, Chicago and New York, Rand, McNally & Company., 1896, p.252. Naser al-Din Shah and the slide have been portrayed in film. In Once Upon a Time, Cinema (1992: original Persian title: Nasseroddin Shah Actor-e Cinema), Golnar, the feisty heroine of classic Iranian movie Lor Girl (1932) is magically transported to the reign of Naser al-Din Shah, who falls in love with her and forces her to join his harem. She escapes after being sent down a slide leading from the women's quarters to a hall in the palace. In Beate Petersen's animated docudrama Nasseredin Shah and his 84 wives (2011) the king is depicted in animated silhouette receiving an endless line of (fully clothed) wives down a slide, while real decisions about the kingdom are made by others. This film won Petersen Best Documentary Director at the Noor Iranian Film Festival.

The headquarters of ATR is located in Stuttgart (Baden-W√ºrttemberg). ATR companies provide auto shops and spare parts dealers with original spare parts and garage equipment.  History  During the 1950s, a large number of major automotive spare parts dealers in Germany came together to publish a joint catalog of automotive spare parts. From the mid-1960s on, the first gas stations began selling automotive accessories: This created competition for wholesalers that had been generating high revenues through sales of accessories. For that reason, several dealers decided to combine their purchase operations. For this to occur, a joint legal form had to be created. This is how ATR GmbH came about in 1967. ATR founding members included wholesalers Auto Merkur, Auto Staiger, Matthies, Stahlgruber und Wessels. ATR is the eldest trading cooperation for automotive spare parts in Germany.Entry in the Trade Register (Handelsregister) at the Amtsgericht Stuttgart (Stuttgart District Court) UR 1092/1968 He Founding members Johannes J. Matthies GmbH & Co KG in Hamburg and Stahlgruber GmbH in Poing, Bavaria have remained part of ATR until today. ATR launched its private label brand Cartechnic for garage products and accessories in 1990. Today, the range includes more than 700 products. The wholesalers involved in ATR pushed on with developing a joint catalog after that, though these efforts only gained momentum with electronic data processing. The ATR partners first showcased their electronic spare parts information system ARTis at the Automechanika trade show in 1992. As sales and purchases of automotive spare parts and accessories in the 1990s gradually turned into a global business, ATR moved with the times and aspired an internationalization. Its first non-German partners were French parts dealer Groupe Laurent (1991) and Spain‚Äôs Gerstenmaier (1992). The foundation of ATR International AG in 1999 created the legal framework for the group-purchasing cooperation‚Äôs international expansion.  Facts and figures  Today, 38 partners along with 281 trading companies in 64 countries form part of ATR International AG. These include members in the USA, South America, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. ATR has now a presence on five continents. ATR partner companies employ more than 151,000 employees and operate approx. 10,000 local sales points. All in all, members of ATR International AG generated external revenues of 26.59 billion euros in 2019. ATR is one of the largest revenue generators among purchasing cooperations serving the independent automotive spare parts market globally. The non-listed AG‚Äôs 38 partners hold the company‚Äôs capital.  Garage workshops  In 2008, ATR consolidated independent garage and specialty store service concepts Meisterhaft, AC AUTO CHECK and autoPARTNER into ATR SERVICE GmbH, which now comprises more than 1,307 owner-operated workshops in Germany (as of July 2020). This makes ATR SERVICE GmbH the largest franchiser of independent multi-brand garages in Germany.Special edition (June 2011), auto service praxis magazine With its 349 workshops located in Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Portugal and Romania, international garage service concept ACC AUTO CHECK CENTER also forms part of ATR.

When they put a link to Web Therapy onto the site, all is resolved. Another hindering in Fiona's business is her mother, Putsy Hodge, who dislikes Web Therapy and is quick to let her know. She reveals she took in a son who she put up for adoption long before marrying Fiona's father. Fiona also sees that Putsy is starting to become unstable and worries for her, and tries to declare her insane in order to give her the best care. Putsy is not happy and decides she wants nothing to do with her daughter for a while. Fiona has Kamal Prakash, an IT worker at Kip's office, help her in setting up her online business. He records various testimonials with her clients, including Jerome and Gina. He and Gina flirt during the recording of her testimonials, which greatly irritates Fiona, and they start dating soon after. When Kip, Fiona's husband of nearly 17 years, worries that Fiona's Web Therapy is ruining his and her reputation, he orders her to shut it down, but she doesn't comply. Fiona soon finds a rival in Robin Griner, who happens to know Kip and is planning to have sex with him during his weekend business trip in Atlanta. Despite Fiona's attempts to warn her that Kip will not cheat on his wife, Robin goes through with it and returns home dejected after he turns her down. She tells Fiona that she heard that Kip only hit on her because he thought she was a transvestite. This leaves Fiona confused. Meanwhile, while Fiona coaches Jerome on being assertive, she discovers that he works at Visa, the credit card company. She tells him to track all of the purchases in Kip's account, which turn out to include downtown areas such as cocktail lounges, coffeehouses, Guns n' Poses novelty retail boutique, various purchases at Manly and Lacey's, and Midnight Tram to Georgia, among other things. This causes Fiona to begin re-evaluating her marriage, while Jerome's assertiveness at work has a side-effect of alienating his co-workers. Fiona contacts Kamal and asks him to fax her some information on Kip's financial reports. He faxes the information over to Fiona, demanding a payment for his overall services. Since Fiona doesn't have enough resources to pay the wages yet, she tells Gina to distract him by meeting his parents while she comes up with the money. This leads to the end of their relationship, however; Kamal's parents disapprove of Gina and are appalled to hear of their son's apparent confusing sexual fantasies, so they send him back to India to go ahead with his arranged or forced marriage. And Gina is in danger of losing her job when lawyers and accountants show up at Lachman Brothers and everyone is forced to erase everything on their computers, and she has to take care of the CFO, who is in a possibly suicidal mood. As a result, Jerome loses his job there because of these difficulties and his new behaviour, and has trouble finding a job elsewhere. Somewhat sympathetic about his job loss and discovering how useful he is, she hires him as her assistant. At this point, Fiona starts work on her semi-autobiographical book entitled \\"Whistling While I Worked\\", based on her life and career at Lachman Brothers, and Jerome helps her in writing the book. Soon, Fiona meets Austen Clarke, a worldwide media mogul who happens to do good deeds to people in poor countries, and one of Ted's clients. He has a problem with relationships, most likely assumed due to being perceived as not nice enough or not willing enough to stay with women rather than going to meetings with famous people, and not good enough sex. He admits he's much more interested in connecting emotionally with people than sleeping with them. Fiona is amazed at how he seems to be a perfect person, he doesn't want to settle down and have kids yet, and she is just about to consider breaking off her marriage. Later, her book receives some publication offers and she contacts him for help on deciding which offer to choose. She emails him the offers so he can help her decide, but when he is checking the email, he realises that she accidentally sent the book as well, and he is one of the few whom she dedicated the book to. He offers to publish the book for her, and later that night, they meet on his plane and have a rendezvous on their way to Bali. Soon enough, Kip contacts her on the plane, she tells him that she is leaving him for a free life and because of all the mistakes he's made in their marriage. Kip tells her that he has high chances of becoming a Republican Congressman for District 17; Fiona can be the wife of a Congressman, just like she wanted since they first started dating, but only if she stays married to him. While Austen is devastated that Fiona may be throwing her new freedom ideals away, Kip tells him that he would appreciate his endorsement for the campaign, and that he only needs her for the election, and wants her to try rebuilding their marriage, at least for the sake of his career. The season ends with Fiona in shock, confused as to what to do.

The series stars Lisa Kudrow as Fiona Wallice, a therapist who has conceived of a new form of therapy: the titular \\"web therapy\\". This season contains the webisodes from seasons three and four of the web series. Plot Kip and Fiona's marriage is clearly on the rocks due to what happened at the end of the previous season, but the two must work together during the campaign, meaning that Austen and Fiona are unable to continue their fling and can only communicate via Skype. Additionally, the publication of Fiona's book is postponed until after the campaign, allowing Fiona to work with Austen's assistant editor Maxine DeMaine and Jerome in New York to make some changes to the book. On Austen's suggestion, Kip attends a sexual orientation camp named \\"Compass\\". While his progress at the center is at a rocky start, Camilla Bowner, the owner and therapist at the center, helps to speed up his recovery with her sexual treatments. Upon hearing this, and concerned that this may be leading to divorce, Fiona contacts Camilla's husband Trent and schedules a private session with him at her house in Philadelphia so Trent can prepare her for her reunion with Kip once he returns home from \\"Compass\\". However, this turns out to be a setup, as Fiona stays in New York as Trent goes to Philadelphia. Kip arrives afterwards and the two wind up having sex. Fiona has caught the sexual encounter on security cameras and tells this to Camilla, who begs Fiona for the tapes, not so she can destroy them, but so that she can display them on a screen above her head so that Trent will open his eyes during sex. Fiona doesn't give in and says she will keep the tapes, as well as stay by her husbands side and not get a divorce. Before signing off, she suggests that if Camilla wants Trent to open his eyes during sex, Camilla should wear a blazer. After Maxine criticizes Fiona's apparent narcissism in the book and questions her likeability factor, Jerome sends Maxine some new chapters of Fiona's book that reveal some hidden moments of her life, moments which Fiona deems too embarrassing or too boring for herself to reveal. Fiona isn't much impressed with Jerome's fiancee Hayley's attempts to write some new material in Fiona's voice, as she is concerned that she might be perceived as weak in the book, so she goes back to New York to work on the book further. When Maxine compliments Fiona on these changes and mentions Austen's possible reaction, Fiona reveals that Austen hasn't returned any of her calls since the start of the campaign. Maxine is quick to catch on that maybe Austen isn't really attracted to Fiona because he hasn't treated her affectionately. Fiona realizes she may be right and decides to change her book deal and calls Austen to dismiss any possibility of a relationship with him at all, deciding to work on her marriage with Kip. But then Austen changes his romantic behavior towards Fiona, making Fiona feel somewhat better. Upon hearing that Maxine got fired, she checks up on her and finds out that Austen sent her flowers from Scotland and had his nanny (whom Fiona described as an \\"ancient Scottish woman\\") meet up with Fiona because he is in love with her, and Maxine used that to get herself fired. Maxine decides to use her retirement package to open up a golf resort for ex-nuns, and wishes Fiona well. Fiona knows well that even though she wants to be with Austen, she still has a few weeks left in her husband's campaign. Instead of deleting the changes, she resolves to keep the changes and keep the character likeable. Soon, Trent returns to Camilla, and they send a donation to Kip and Fiona's home, including a pair of Trent's boxers. The issue of Kip being gay pops up again when Robin meets up with Fiona, intending to make amends for her sexual behaviour towards Kip. She has gotten help for her depression and realized she had no right to even go after a married man because Fiona would get hurt. Fiona then reveals that during the course of her marriage so far, she has had doubts and suspicions about Kip having an affair, but has come to an understanding over the situation. Robin then reveals that she has taped the entire conversation, and implies she may release it publicly if she cannot overcome the situation any further. Fiona hires Richard as part of the campaign team, and during a discussion with Kip's campaign manager Ben Tomlund, she recommends Robin as a documentarian to produce video material for the campaign. However, once the hiring transaction is confirmed, Ben reveals he cannot find any sign of Fiona's accreditation, and tells her to temporarily suspend her services until she receives the accreditation notice. So in a moment of desperation, she asks her sister Shevaun Haig, a psychotherapist, to help her get the accreditation. However, Shevaun says that Fiona has to undergo the 50-minute sessions in order for the accreditation to take effect. Fiona also learns from these sessions that her own mother isn't doing so well. Fiona feels run-down during the sessions with Shevaun because she reminded her of everything that went wrong in her life, and starts to feel that her own sister is using her for her own benefit. When Shevaun signs the accreditation form, Fiona feels relieved, and as a result, her popularity as a web therapist starts to skyrocket as a result. Fiona begins to gain interest from high-profile celebrities such as Kirsten Noble, who interviews her for her popular blog \\"Neuroticornucorpia\\", and television actress Allegra Faverau, who found Fiona's book on a plane, and wants to film a movie adaptation of the book with herself starring as Fiona for Lifetime. However, Kirsten puts some weird sexual fantasies featuring a persona known as \\"Filona W.\\" and some digitally altered photos of Fiona on her blog, which does not do good for the campaign, and makes Kip suspect that Fiona is a lesbian. However, after lawyer trouble, Kirsten censors these fantasies and puts a link on her blog to Web Therapy, and both do admit that it has attracted wild publicity for both of them; TMZ picked up on the blog and the LGBT community is giving their support to the campaign. However, after Fiona agrees to appear on a live chat on Kirsten's blog, they both discover that her blog is inaccessible. Fiona then realizes that Austen had bought BlogSpot, the domain which Kirsten's blog is under, and the blog may have been erased in the acquisition. As for Allegra, Fiona accompanies her to Los Angeles to prepare for her role, but Jerome asks Hayley to accompany her on the trip. The trip does not go well, when Hayley is arrested at the airport due to mysterious scissors in her luggage, and Fiona encourages Allegra to have a drink, and unknowingly and unwittingly causes her drinking to go out of control. Allegra believes her career to be over, but Fiona reveals that Lifetime are moving forward with the movie project, just not with her. Fiona then encounters Gina, who, after losing her job, is finding it difficult to adjust to being unemployed. Fiona tries to help her find a good job, but doubting that she can work herself at such a low level as a receptionist, she tells Gina that there is a job opening in Yukon Canneries in Alaska as a shipping specialist. Some time later, Austen promotes her and she prepares for her new job in London. Jerome and Hayley have married and are trying to have a baby, and have hired a surrogate Tammy. Fiona soon learns that Tammy is expecting Jerome and Hayley to do favors for her and give her large cheques, and risks jeopardizing Jerome's position in his job as a result. After some negotiation with Tammy, she agrees to give Jerome a raise to cover the expenses. However, she realizes that Tammy is lying about the pregnancy and scamming both Jerome and Hayley, and informs Jerome about her deception. Jerome is grateful that Fiona saved his marriage from a con artist, and now he and Hayley are starting to talk about having a family the right way. Fiona becomes angry when she discovers that Ben has postponed her appearance on a TV show and indirectly accuses her of making Kip lose his youth and damaging his career. She starts to suspect a relationship between Kip and Ben beginning. Upset about this accusation, Ben almost quits the campaign. However, they resolve their differences and agree to work together for the campaign, and Ben assures Fiona that there is nothing going on between him and Kip. Fiona does a series of video chat sessions with her college friend Newell Miller, whom she does not recognise at first. After he attempts to break into her home, he reminds Fiona that she slept with his father, a professor, at one point while they were in college, and Newell witnessed the sexual encounter. As a result, he has had a series of disastrous relationships because the women remind him of Fiona. He plans a romantic session with Fiona to cure himself of his obsession, but Fiona turns him down, not willing to cheat on her husband during the campaign. She does set him up with some sessions with Shevaun, which helps to finally cure him. When quizzed on how she knows Shevaun, she tells Newell of their family history, and that she went to the same college as Newell because Shevaun went there before. Shevaun may have inspired her to sleep with the professor when her grades were plummeting, a trick she might have done earlier, when her hair was blonde. Newell is unsure whether or not he may have witnessed Shevaun instead of Fiona on that day, but he knows that Shevaun definitely started it. Fiona discovers that Putsy is in danger of being charged for the murder of her roommate, which may have been the result of her puppetry practice. Fiona succeeds in helping her mother avoid the murder charges. However, she is horrified when she discovers that she is starting a \\"Net Therapy\\" business and using puppetry in her practice. In one of the final storylines of the season, Fiona discovers that Richard has feelings for co-worker Robin, and has started dating her. Another session with Richard and Robin reveals that Robin ordinarily doesn't get serious with co- workers at all. Richard isn't surprised, but thought she had real feelings for him, and Robin reveals she is dating him as a rebound after her relationship with Kip. She reveals she possesses tapes which apparently show Kip and Ben engaging in sexual intercourse, infuriating both Richard and Fiona. Fiona demands that Robin hand over the tapes, but she refuses despite the terms on her contract. She implies that Richard is only dating her to move on from Fiona despite the fact that he is still in love with her, which he denies. Fiona also starts to see how condescending Robin is to Richard, and how he is becoming more and more upset by her, and it reminds her of how her chances of a possible romance with Austen are being hindered by her husband's campaign. Unable to take it anymore, Fiona fires Robin and Richard breaks up with her, and Robin does what Fiona had expected; she releases the tapes and puts the entire campaign in jeopardy. Kip starts to panic and then eventually resigns from his candidate post. Fiona is horrified to see that the viral video editing the resignation to make it appear that Kip is \\"coming out\\" is getting more attention than the actual resignation. Kip's downfall does not stop Fiona from achieving her own success in her rights, as Hayley asks Fiona for her forgiveness for the sessions and the airport incident, which Fiona accepts, and announces with Jerome that they helped with the Lifetime movie project. Hayley had pitched the movie to be reworked into a musical named \\"Whistlin'\\", which was very popular with the network. Despite the fact that the format is now different from Fiona and Allegra's original plan, Jerome convinces her that the characters will be explored further using this format and she reluctantly agrees to let them work the project as long as she receives royalties for being the author of the book that originated the movie. To accommodate the new production schedule, Jerome decides to temporarily work for Putsy for her \\"Net Therapy\\" business, and has Hayley take his place as Fiona's assistant. Fiona objects to this new arrangement, so Hayley says that if that doesn't work, she will do another Lifetime project along with the movie, about a man who is trapped between his lover, his partner, his supporter and his boss. Fiona, mostly because it doesn't matter because she needs to talk to Austen and may be going to New York for a while, feels more than happy to let them do whatever they please, and Jerome and Hayley are surprised to finally see some good heart from the therapist. Kip tells Fiona that he is going to Sante Fe, New Mexico with Ben for a while, because they need some time apart and he ultimately needs to know what he wants to do next. Despite their impending separation, they decide to keep good memories of their time together and wish each other well. Later, Fiona announces her separation to Austen and tells him that now they can be together. When Austen appears to be worried, Fiona assures him that they can take things slow because she isn't divorcing Kip yet. However, Gina comes onto the video screen, saying that she took four pregnancy tests, all positive, and tells Austen that they are having quadruplets. She then realises that Fiona was watching her at this moment. Austen assures Fiona \\"It's not how it looks.\\" as she stares in shock on the fact that her best friend may be pregnant with her potential lover's child. A confused Gina says the final words of the season: \\"How does it look?\\" Cast =Regular cast= * Lisa Kudrow as Fiona Wallice (11 episodes) * Dan Bucatinsky as Jerome Sokoloff (10 episodes) * Victor Garber as Kip Wallice (6 episodes) * Jennifer Elise Cox as Gina Spinks (5 episodes) * Alan Cumming as Austen Clarke (4 episodes) * Julie Claire as Robin Griner (3 episodes) * Michael McDonald as Ben Tomlund (2 episodes) * Lily Tomlin as Putsy Hodge (2 episodes) * Tim Bagley as Richard Pratt (2 episodes) * Rashida Jones as Hayley (1 episode) =Guest cast= * David Schwimmer as Newell Miller (4 episodes) * Rosie O'Donnell as Maxine DeMaine (3 episodes) * Meryl Streep as Camilla Bowner (2 episodes) * Molly Shannon as Kirsten Noble (2 episodes) * Minnie Driver as Allegra Favreau (2 episodes) * Selma Blair as Tammy Hines (2 episodes) * Conan O'Brien as Conan O'Brien (2 episodes) * Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Shevaun Haig (1 episode) The actors are not distinguished between regular and guest cast in the show.

Adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (adhesion GPCRs) are a class of 33 human protein receptors with a broad distribution in embryonic and larval cells, cells of the reproductive tract, neurons, leukocytes, and a variety of tumours. Adhesion GPCRs are found throughout metazoans and are also found in single-celled colony forming choanoflagellates such as Monosiga brevicollis and unicellular organisms such as Filasterea. The defining feature of adhesion GPCRs that distinguishes them from other GPCRs is their hybrid molecular structure. The extracellular region of adhesion GPCRs can be exceptionally long and contain a variety of structural domains that are known for the ability to facilitate cell and matrix interactions. Their extracellular region contains the membrane proximal GAIN (GPCR-Autoproteolsis INducing) domain. Crystallographic and experimental data has shown this structurally conserved domain to mediate autocatalytic processing at a GPCR- proteolytic site (GPS) proximal to the first transmembrane helix. Autocatalytic processing gives rise to an extracellular (Œ±) and a membrane- spanning (Œ≤) subunit, which are associated non-covalently, resulting in expression of a heterodimeric receptor at the cell surface. Ligand profiles and in vitro studies have indicated a role for adhesion GPCRs in cell adhesion and migration. Work utilizing genetic models confined this concept by demonstrating that the primary function of adhesion GPCRs may relate to the proper positioning of cells in a variety of organ systems. Moreover, growing evidence implies a role of adhesion GPCRs in tumour cell metastasis. Formal G protein-coupled signalling has been demonstrated for a number for adhesion GPCRs, however, the orphan receptor status of many of the receptors still hampers full characterisation of potential signal transduction pathways. In 2011, the adhesion GPCR consortium was established to facilitate research of the physiological and pathological functions of adhesion GPCRs.  Classification  The GPCR superfamily is the largest gene family in the human genome containing approximately 800 genes. As the vertebrate superfamily can be phylogenetic grouped into five main families, the GRAFS classification system has been proposed, which included Glutamate, Rhodopsin, Adhesion, Frizzled/Taste2, and Secretin GPCR families. There are 33 human adhesion GPCRs that can be broken down in the 8 groups and 2 independent receptors. Group I consists of LPHN1, LPHN2, LPHN3, and ETL. Group II consists of CD97, EMR1, EMR2, EMR3, and EMR4. Group III consists of GPR123, GPR124, and GPR125. Group IV consists of CELSR1, CELSR2, and CELSR3. Group V consists of GPR133 and GPR144. Group VI consists of GPR110, GPR111, GPR113, GPR115, and GPR116. Group VII consists of BAI1, BAI2, and BAI3. Group VIII consists of GPR56, GPR97, GPR112, GPR114, GPR126, and GPR64. Two additional adhesion GPCRs do not fit into these groups: VLGR1 and GPR128.Schi√∂th HB, Nordstr√∂m KJ, Fredriksson R.The adhesion GPCRs; gene repertoire, phylogeny and evolution. Adv Exp Med Biol. 2010;706:1-13. Non-humans and evolution Adhesion GPCRs are found in fungi. They are believed to have evolved from the cAMP receptor family, arising approximately 1275 million years ago before the split of Unikonts from a common ancestor. Several fungi have novel adhesion GPCRs that have both short, 2‚Äì66 amino acid residues, and long, 312‚Äì4202 amino acid residues. Analysis of fungi showed that there were no secretin receptor family GPCRs, which suggests that they evolved from adhesion GPCRs in a later organism. Genome analysis of the Teleost Takifugu rubripes has revealed that it has only two adhesion GPCRs that showed homology to Ig-hepta/GPR116.Sarkar A., Kumar S., and Sundar D. (2011). The G protein-coupled receptors in the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes. BMC Bioinformatics 12(S-1) S3 While the Fugu genome is relatively compact and limited with the number of adhesion GPCRs, the Tetraodon nigroviridis, another species of puffer fish, has considerably more, totaling 29 adhesion GPCRs.  Ligands  A majority of the adhesion GPCRs are orphan receptors and work is underway to de-orphanize many of these receptors . Adhesion GPCRs get their name from their N-terminal domains that have adhesion-like domains, such as EGF, and the belief that they interact with cell to cell and cell to extra cellular matrix. While ligands for many receptors are still not known, researchers are utilizing drug libraries to investigate compounds that can activate GPCRs and using these data for future ligand research. One adhesion GPCR, GPR56, has a known ligand, collagen III, which is involved in neural migration inhibition. GPR56 has been shown to be the cause of polymicrogyria in humans and may play a role in cancer metastasis. The binding of collagen III to GPR56 occurs on the N-terminus and has been narrowed down to a short stretch of amino acids. The N-terminus of GPR56 is naturally glycosylated, but this glycosylation is not necessary for collagen III binding. Collagen III, results in GPR56 to signal through GŒ±12/13 activating RhoA.  Signaling  Adhesion GPCRs appear capable to follow standard GPCR signaling modes and signal through GŒ±s, GŒ±q, GŒ±i, and GŒ±12/13. As of today, many of the adhesion GPCRs are still orphan receptors and their signalling pathways have not been identified. Research groups are working to elucidate the downstream signaling molecules utilizing several methods, including chemical screens and analysis of second messenger levels in over- expressed cells. Adding drugs in vitro, while the cells are over-expressing an adhesion GPCR, has allowed the identification of the molecules activating the GPCR and the second messengers being utilized. GPR133 signals through GŒ±s to activate adenylyl cyclase. It has been shown that overexpressing GPCRs in vitro can result in receptor activation in the absence of a ligand or agonist. By over expressing GPR133 in vitro, an elevation in reporter genes and cAMP was observed. Signaling of the overexpressed GPR133 did not require an N-terminus or GPS cleavage. Missense mutations in the 7TM region resulted in loss of signalling. The latrophilin homolog LPHN1 was shown in C. elegans to require a GPS for signaling, but cleavage at the GPS site was not necessary. Furthermore, having a shortened 7 transmembrane domain, but with an intact GPS domain, resulted in a loss of signaling. This suggests that having both the GPS and 7 transmembrane domain intact is involved in signaling and that the GPS site could act as or be a necessary part of an endogenous ligand. GPR56 has been shown to be cleaved at the GPS site and then remain associated with the 7TM domain. In a study where the N-terminus was removed up to N342 (the start of the GPS), the receptor became constitutively active and an up regulation of GŒ±12/13 was seen. When receptors are active, they are ubiquitinated and GPR56 lacking an N-terminus was highly ubiquitinated. Cleavage Many adhesion GPCRs undergo proteolytic events posttranslationally at highly conserved Cys-rich motifs known as GPCR proteolysis sites (GPS), which is located next to the first transmembrane region. This site is called the HL-S(T) site. Once this protein is cleaved, the pieces are expressed at the cell surface as a heterodimer. This cleavage is thought to happen from within the protein itself, through the conserved GAIN domain. This process seems to be similar to those found in other auto- proteolytic proteins such as the Ntn hydrolases and hedgehog proteins. (GAIN) domain, rat latrophilin mediates autocatalytic cleavage of adhesion GPCRs Domains One characteristic of adhesion GPCRs is their extended extracellular region. This region is modular in nature, often possessing a variety of structurally defined protein domains and a membrane proximal GAIN domain. In the aptly named Very Large G protein-coupled Receptor 1 VLGR1 the extracellular region extends up to almost 6000 amino acids. Human adhesion GPCRs possess domains including EGF-like (), Cadherin (), thrombospondin (), Immunoglobulin (), Pentraxin (), Calx-beta () and Leucine-rich repeats (). In non-vertebrate species multiple other structural motifs including Kringle, Somatomedin B (), SRCR () may be contained with the extracellular region. Since many of these domains have been demonstrated to mediate protein-protein interactions within other proteins, they are believed to play the same role in adhesion GPCRs. Indeed, many ligands have been discovered for adhesion GPCRs (see ligands section). Many of the adhesion GPCR possess long stretches of amino acids with little homology to known protein domains suggesting the possibility of new structural domains being elucidated within their extracellular regions.  Roles =Immune system= A number of adhesion GPCRs may have important roles within the immune system. In particular, members the EGF-TM7 subfamily which possess N-terminal EGF-like domains are predominantly restricted to leukocytes suggesting a putative role in immune function. The human EGF‚ÄëTM7 family is composed of CD97, EMR1 (F4/80 receptor orthologue) EMR2, EMR3 and EMR4 (a probable pseudogene in humans). The human- restricted EMR2 receptor, is expressed by myeloid cells including monocytes, dendritic cells and neutrophils has been shown to be involved in the activation and migration of human neutrophils and upregulated in patients suffering from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Details of EMR1, CD97 needed. The adhesion‚ÄëGPCR brain angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) acts as a phosphatidylserine receptor playing a potential role in the binding and clearance of apoptotic cells, and the phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria. GPR56 has been shown to a marker for inflammatory NK cell subsets and to be expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes. =Neuronal development= GPR126 is necessary for Schwann cell myelination. Knockouts of this adhesion GPCR in both Danio rerio and Mus musculus result in an arrest at the promyelinating stage. Schwann cells arise from the neural crest, which migrates to peripheral nerves to form either myelinating or non-myelinating cells. In GPR126 knockouts, these precursor cells develop to the promyelinating stage, where they have wrapped approximately 1.5 times. Myelination is arrested at the promyelinating stage and in fish no myelin basic protein can be detected. In fish this can be rescued by adding forskolin during development, which rescues myelin basic protein expression. =Bone marrow and hematapoietic stem cells= GPR56 may play a role in the interactions between bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells. =Disease= Loss of function mutations have been shown in a number of adhesion GPCRs, including GPR56, GPR126 and VLRG1. Many mutations affect function via decreased cell surface expression or inhibition of autoproteolysis within the GAIN domain. Mutations in GPR56 result in bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria in humans, characterized by abnormal neuronal migration and surface ectopias.,Singer K., Luo R., Jeong S., Piao X. (2012) GPR56 and the Developing Cerebral Cortex: Cells, Matrix, and Neuronal Migration. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 10.1007/s12035-012-8343-0 Variants of GPR126 have been associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, as well as being responsible for severe arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Gain of function mutations within the GAIN domain of EMR2 have been shown to result in excessive degranulation by mast cells resulting in vibratory urticaria.

It is a yellow to brown, striped snake that reaches up to a meter in length. It gives live birth and is venomous enough to be dangerous to humans. The primary distinguishing trait of the rough-scaled sea snake is the presence of a single spine on every scale covering the snake's body. The snake's tough, spiny scales may protect it from being buffeted against the rocks of its stony estuary habitats by the action of the waves and currents. Other less spectacular traits distinguishing it from other members of the genus Hydrophis include the lack of a groove running through the scales underlying its abdomen, a larger and rounder skull, differing numbers of scales around the circumference of different bodily regions, and a larger number of stripes than many sea snakes have. Discovery The 2012 formal scientific description of the rough-scaled sea snake was not published until 12 years after Bryan Fry of Queensland University originally discovered the snake in 2000. The specific epithet was chosen to honor Dave Donald, the skipper of the boat used during the expedition that discovered the snake. The scientists attributed their discovery to Donald's hard work and familiarity with the local waters of Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria. The discovery and scientific documentation of the rough-scaled sea snake was delayed by many factors. The presence of many dangerous predators like bull sharks and saltwater crocodiles makes surveying the local environment hazardous. Compounding on the danger of the predators is the presence of venomous life, like box jellyfish. In an interview with National Geographic, Fry joked that a diver in the Bay of Carpentaria has a life expectancy \\"measured in minutes\\". One of the most important factors was the extreme rarity of this species. In more than a decade of local sea snake research only 9 rough-scaled sea snakes have ever been found. Meanwhile, the same researchers had encountered some 10,000 individuals of other sea snake species in the same time period. Even if a rough-scaled sea snake was nearby it would likely be difficult to see due to the low visibility of its murky habitat. The rough-scaled sea snake had managed to avoid being serendipitously discovered by local fishermen trawling for prawns the way many other sea snake species are commonly caught. This can likely be attributed to the snakes' preference for the shallow rocky waters of local estuaries that are not fished for prawns.

Early life Richard Shelton (or Sheldon or Shilton) was the elder of the two sons of John Shelton (d. 1601) a mercer of Birmingham, by his wife Barbara, daughter and heir of Francis Stanley of West Bromwich, Staffordshire. He studied law at the Inner Temple, and had the good fortune to be employed by Charles I‚Äôs favourite, the Duke of Buckingham who was probably the means of Shelton's appointment as Reader at the Inner Temple in 1624. Solicitor General It was also to Buckingham‚Äôs influence that Shelton owed his promotion as Solicitor General in October 1625 and was knighted by Charles I at Hampton Court that month. He sat in Parliament for Bridgnorth in Shropshire but his lack of debating power rendered him no match for Coke and the great opposition lawyers of the day. In 1628 he was appointed Treasurer of the Inner Temple. As Solicitor General, Shelton was appointed to a commission to compound with recusants in November 1625 and in December 1633 to the reinforced High Commission, which exercised ecclesiastical jurisdiction in England and Wales. During a Commons debate in February 1629 he defended the appointment of Richard Montagu, object of attack in the Commons, as bishop of Chichester. After the assassination of Buckingham in August 1628 Shelton does not appear to have had a major patron. When the Attorney General, Sir Robert Heath was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in October 1631 it was not Shelton, but William Noy, who succeeded him as Attorney although the succession of the Solicitor General to the post was the usual pattern. It is not known whether Shelton pushed his case for promotion; if he did, his failure may have been because he lacked a strong patron at court. Downfall In October 1634, being, according to Clarendon, \\"an old, illiterate, useless person,\\" The Earl of Clarendon, History of the Great Rebellion, 2.110. 1711. Shelton was pressured into resignation and was succeeded by Sir Edward Littleton. However, as he had not been accused of misbehaviour, he could not simply be dismissed and Shelton was able to negotiate a settlement that left him King's counsellor-at-large, with his former status and profits intact, and it appears that he could have opted for appointments as King's serjeant or puisne justice. More recently it has been suggested that he may have made himself unacceptable to the government by expressing doubts about the legality of levying Ship Money in peacetime,G. E. Aylmer, The King's Servants: the Civil Service of Charles I, 1625-1642, 112-13. or that both he and Sir Robert Heath were forced out in the autumn of 1634 when an old matter ‚Äì an agreement made under James I concerning plantations in Ulster and the obligations of the City of London - resurfaced in a Star Chamber case in the summer of that year. Having apparently been interpreted in a lax fashion by the law officers of the Crown (Heath as Attorney General, Shelton as Solicitor General) this caused the King some displeasure.Thomas G. Barnes, Cropping the Heath: The Fall of a Chief Justice, 1634, Historical Research Volume 64 Issue 155, pages 331‚Äì343. However, it is also possible that William Laud, archbishop of Canterbury, in cementing his power at court wanted law officers in place, like Sir Edward Littleton, who owed a personal loyalty to him. Later life Shelton was not greatly involved with government business after he gave up his position although in March 1639 he joined other benchers of the Inner Temple in making a contribution to support the king's expedition against Scotland. He retired to the manor of West Bromwich, which he had acquired from his cousin William Stanley in 1626, together with 1,599 acres of land.Victoria County History. A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 17 by MW Greenslade (Ed), A P Baggs, G C Baugh, D A Johnston, (1976). He contributed ¬£150 to the Staffordshire Parliamentarian county committee in 1644 and otherwise lived there apparently without incident throughout the Civil War and died there in December 1647. He was buried at West Bromwich on 7 December.West Bromwich Parish Registers.

Its leaves are almost straight, and reddish- green in colour. It is indigenous to the coastal rocks, dunes and plains along the far southern coast of South Africa. This coastal strip extends along the whole of the Eastern Cape coast, but also extends into the Western Cape as far as Riversdale and into neighbouring KwaZulu-Natal. Its sweet edible fruits are grazed by tortoises and other southern African animals, and are also used locally to make traditional preserves. Of the other six Carpobrotus species which occur in South Africa, this species is particularly closely related to Carpobrotus muirii which occurs just to the west of its range, in the Western Cape.

He served as a municipal council member in Tune and also as an MP in 1913‚Äì1915, later deputy in 1922‚Äì1924. Early life and political career He was born at Ihleeie in Stange as a son of crofter Anders Johannesen Moeskau and Tolline Andreasdatter. His father later started as a laborer at Hamar Melkefabrik, and after Moeskau had spent his adolescence at sea, from 1882 to 1889, he too was hired at Hamar Melkefabrik. In 1891 he moved to work at Sannesund Melkefabrik in Tune. Moeskau chaired the Labour Party branch in Smaalenenes Amt from 1904 to 1908, and was also a central board member of the Labour Party from 1906. He was elected to the executive committee of Tune municipal council in 1907. He was also fielded as the party candidate in parliamentary elections. In the 1906 Norwegian parliamentary election, Tune was a new constituency. Moeskau carried 426 votes in the first round, but lost. In the second round, Labour generally backed the Liberal candidate to avoid the Coalition candidate; as a result Moeskau received only 7 votes in this round. However, in 1909, Moeskau won the first round with 1,045 votes, prevailing over four other candidates. It was not enough to win a parliamentary seat, and in the second round, the conservative parties cooperated against him, with a compromise candidate Gunnerius Furuholmen edging out Moeskau by 2,477 against 1,494 votes (Liberal candidate Johan M. Schie also carried 861 votes). Parliament and later career In the 1912 Norwegian parliamentary election he was elected to the Parliament of Norway and served through one term. In the first round of voting Moeskau had again achieved a plurality, with 1,640 votes against Furuholmen's 1,516 and Liberal Hans Str√∏ms√¶ther's 1,370. In the second round, then, Moeskau narrowly edged out Furuholmen with 2,081 against 2,079 votes with Str√∏ms√¶ther also carrying 1,876. When Parliament found irregularities in the Tune vote in January 1913, and cancelled the second round, a new round was held in which Moeskau prevailed over the two others with 2,247‚Äî2,030‚Äî1,537. His deputy was J. O. Thue. Moeskau was a member of the Standing Committee on Customs. In 1915, Moeskau faced Furuholmen's former deputy MP Kristian Edvart Jahren, whose brother was already a six-term MP from Rygge constituency. As in the two previous elections, Moeskau won the first round with 2,303 votes and Jahren trailing in second with 1,621. In the second round, the liberal vote spread across Labour and Conservative, with Jahren gathering 3,620 votes against Moeskau's 3,011 and winning the seat. In 1918, Moeskau again won the first round, over Jahren, Str√∏ms√¶ther and the Agrarian candidate Peter Hjalmar Finnestad in a distant fourth place. In the second round, however, the Liberal Party fielded Finnestad as their candidate while the Conservatives pulled Jahren from the race. Finnestad subsequently beat Moeskau with 3,813 against 2,544 votes. Moeskau would later join the new party Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway, which split from Labour in 1921. He was the third ballot candidate for the party in the 1921 election. The election was successful as he became first deputy for the pair Johannes Bergersen and Peter Olai Thorvik.

Recipe  The colas are produced as a flavour concentrate or syrup that is then mixed with bulk ingredients to produce the drink. Completed flavour concentrates are sold by some of the open cola producers. The bulk ingredients include those such as sweeteners (sugar or artificial), caffeine and the source of acidity, phosphoric or citric acid. As these are added later, after the flavour blending stage, sugar and caffeine levels per batch can be tailored to a market's particular taste. Coca-Cola's own flavouring syrup is known in-house as \\"Merchandise 7X\\", which is cross-referenced in the open recipes. Cube Microplex, home of Cube-Cola A typical recipe is based on eight essential oils, listed here in approximate order of decreasing volume: * orange oil * lime oil * cassia oil * lemon oil * nutmeg oil * coriander oil * lavender oil * neroli oil These are based on the \\"Pemberton formula.\\" Although claimed as the Coca-Cola recipe, this has been refuted by The Coca-Cola Company. This recipe is also similar to the Merory and Beal recipes. One ingredient that is missing from these recipes is the eponymous kola nut, although this did appear in Reed's recipe. The use of lavender oil is considered something of a personal taste. Neroli is frequently omitted altogether, owing to its high cost and relatively small contribution to the overall flavour. Neroli alone may represent a third of the concentrate ingredients cost. As well as the basic list of flavouring ingredients, there are other ingredients such as food grade gum arabic and a considerable degree of \\"art\\" in its manufacture. The precise quality and sourcing of ingredients makes an appreciable difference, particularly in the process of emulsifying the concentrate. Small quantities of alcohol may be used to facilitate this process; as an open recipe, this is under the control of the manufacturer who may avoid such ingredients if halal or similar rules would require it.

Description This species of Carpobrotus has distinctively slender (40‚Äì80mm x 5‚Äì6 mm), incurved, glaucous-green leaves. Of the other six Carpobrotus species which occur in South Africa, this species is particularly closely related to the larger Carpobrotus deliciosus, which occurs to the east of its range, extending into the Eastern Cape. However the dwarf sourfig has thinner, narrower leaves, and only occurs in the Western Cape. Its sweet edible fruits are grazed by tortoises and other southern African animals, and are also used locally to make traditional preserves. Distribution This species has a small distribution range, being restricted to the Overberg region in the Western Cape, South Africa. It occurs near the towns of Heidelberg and Riversdale. Near the coast it can be found from Arniston and De Hoop, as far east as Stilbaai. Here it is found in Strandveld vegetation, usually within ten kilometres of the coast. Its natural range is declining due to alien invasive species and wheat farming.

HAC is located in Hatch End, Harrow, North London, in the Elliott Hall and other buildings that were previously part of the Royal Commercial Travellers School. It is the only dedicated performing arts venue in the borough. History The Elliott Hall was built in 1904 and was the assembly hall to a much larger, but sadly demolished, building of the Royal Commercial Travellers School designed by H O Cresswell. It is named after B. G. Elliott, one time pupil and scholar at the RCT, who was President of the Committee tasked with the funding and building of the hall. After the closure of the school in 1967 the site was purchased by Harrow Council to house Harrow College of Further Education and St. Teresa's School. An arts venue has been operating on the site since 1988. Harrow Council has been managing Harrow Arts Centre since 2007. Prior to its move to the current Hatch End site, Harrow Arts Centre was based at a much smaller venue in Harrow Weald https://www.francisfrith.com/uk/wealdstone/the-original-harrow-arts-centre-at- wealdstone_memory-203790 that was demolished and is now the site of a DIY store. Current activities HAC comprises two performance spaces with dressing rooms, a dedicated dance studio, 5 art rooms, an ICT suite, and 8 multi-purpose rehearsal spaces and meeting rooms. The Elliott Hall is the largest performance space, with 438 seats. The Studio is a black box performance space with 120 seats.http://www.harrowarts.com/about/performances The Gallery at HAC is a contemporary art gallery, and exhibitions are also displayed year round in the Corridor Galleries. HAC presents a programme of performances, events, exhibitions, and workshops throughout the year, both programmed by the in house team and presented by companies and individuals who hire performance or classroom space. The programme includes regular work with community groups and schools; for example, in 2012 HAC worked with artist Alistair Lambert to create a mural with Years 3 and 5 at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School for the subway next to their school. As well as the HAC team, the venue houses Harrow Music Services, and Harrow Council's Adult and Community and Family Learning Team. The venue's two resident companies are Srishti and Bearfoot School of Performing Arts. Hatch End library is within the arts centre building, and Hatch End swimming pool is beside the dance studio. The cafe, Simply Daisy's, and bistro are run by the same company who run the popular Daisy's in the Park cafe in Pinner. In 2019, a competition was launched to select an architect to create plans for additional classrooms and workshops for the Gallery, which was won by Chris Dyson Architects.

It was based on a story by C.S. Forester that appeared in Cosmopolitan magazine, and inspired by media reports of the fighting in the Battle of Britain, in particular, the American pilots who volunteered before the United States entered World War II, to fly for the Royal Air Force in the actual Eagle Squadrons. Plot As war breaks out in Europe, young Americans Chuck S. Brewer (Robert Stack), Johnny M. Coe (Leif Erickson) and Wadislaw Borowsky (Edgar Barrier) cross the Atlantic to join the Royal Air Force. Assigned to the Eagle Squadron, made up of other American pilots, they make friends with Squadron Leader Paddy Carson (John Loder), and women flyers Anne Partridge (Diana Barrymore) and Nancy Mitchell (Evelyn Ankers). Chuck is immediately attracted to Nancy, but she already has a boyfriend, Hank Starr (Jon Hall), another pilot in the squadron. Once they are trained as fighter pilots, on their first mission against a German air force base, Johnny and Chuck are shot down, and Johnny is killed. Chuck parachutes into the sea and is rescued, but back at the base, he learns that two other pilots trying to protect them when both Americans broke formation, were also killed. At a military dance, Chuck and Anne arrange for a date that turns out to be a picnic with a group of evacuated children, interrupted by a German air raid. Later, Squadron Leader Carson, who also likes Anne, takes her to London, with Chuck following the pair. During the bombing of a hospital, Anne is wounded leading others out of the burning building, but finds her father, Sir James Partridge (Paul Cavanagh), a noted pacifist, who dies in her arms. Chuck and Wadislaw, along with Carson, take part in a commando raid in France to capture a top-secret new \\"Leopard\\" German fighter. The mission ends with Carson and Wadislaw dead, but Chuck takes off and shoots his way out of enemy territory, bringing the stolen fighter aircraft back to England. At an award ceremony, both Chuck and Anne are decorated for their bravery, but the ceremony is cut short by another German air raid. Chuck, who has proposed to Anne, kisses her on the cheek before taking to the air. Cast * Robert Stack as Chuck S.

Directed by John Rawlins, the film stars Loretta Young and Geraldine Fitzgerald. It tells the story of the paramilitary Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron formed in the United States during World War II. Film historians and scholars consider Ladies Courageous an √†-clef story of famed aviator Jacqueline Cochran and test pilot Nancy Harkness Love's work to mobilize women pilots to contribute to the war effort. Plot In World War II, Roberta Harper (Loretta Young) leads the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS), made up of 25 women who ferry aircraft across the United States allowing male pilots to be released for combat service. Despite their success, her commanding officer, Colonel Andy Brennan (Richard Fraser) says that her pilots may not be able to handle dangerous missions. Roberta also has to contend with her impetuous sister, Virginia \\"Virgie\\" Alford (Geraldine Fitzgerald), and other concerns such as an affair involving Nadine Shannon (Diana Barrymore), one of her pilots. Famous aerobatic pilot Gerry Vail (Anne Gwynne), a member of \\"The Flying Vails\\", is afraid that her 100th flight may be her last, a fate that befell her father and brothers during their 100th performance. Roberta assures her that her 100th flight has already taken place. The WAFS soon have a real tragedy when one of their own dies in a crash. With the depression that sets in among the women, a top-secret mission to deliver aircraft to \\"Easy Queen Island,\\" a front line air base in the Pacific, appears to be the way to prove their worth to their army superiors. Roberta is mortified when publicity-seeking Virgie crashes her aircraft on purpose and is \\"washed-out\\" by her older sister. Roberta accepts the blame for tolerating Virgie's reckless behavior, and resigns from the WAFS. She then learns her husband Tommy (Phillip Terry) is \\"missing in action\\". Virgie tries to make things right, but after stealing an aircraft to fly to army headquarters in Washington, crashes and nearly kills herself. Although the WAFS seems to be in disarray, a surprise announcement by Brigadier General Wade (Samuel S. Hinds), a high-ranking Pentagon officer, changes everything. He informs Roberta, who has recently returned as their leader, that the unit is to be part of the military as the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS). The ferry mission to the Pacific has also been reinstated. As the squadron readies for their new mission, Roberta is reunited with her husband, who returned home safely. The squadron is finally able to take off and head to the Pacific to deliver much-needed combat aircraft, including the latest fighter and bomber aircraft from American factories.

After approval of the script, under the working title of \\"When Ladies Fly\\", pre-production began with the choice of Loretta Young, under contract at Universal Pictures, as the lead, with Geraldine Fitzgerald, on loan from Warner Bros., playing her younger sister.Dick 2011, p. 130. While director John Rawlins was about to begin principal photography, the United States Army Air Forces reviewed its commitment to the project, demanding major script revisions and threatening to have the film closed down. Although the initial script had been approved, the USAAF was worried the film treatment was unsympathetic to women and that the film subject was no longer relevant, since on August 5, 1943, the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPS) had absorbed the earlier organization.\\"Notes: Ladies Courageous (1944).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

Wanger argued that considerable financial commitment had already been made, but faced with opposition from the military, relented and agreed to the 13 changes that were demanded.

By the time the troubled production reached the screen, Ladies Courageous was already the subject of a congressional review of the formation of the Women Airforce Service Pilots.Merryman 2001, pp. 71‚Äì72. The film also struck a discordant tone with viewers and critics alike, who were not pleased with what Variety characterized as \\"... over-theatricalized\\" portrayals.Orriss 1984, p. 87. Reviewer Thomas M. Pryor emphatically noted in The New York Times that \\"... 'Ladies Courageous' represents a very curious compliment to the WAFS on the part of its producer, Walter Wanger, and the Army Air Force, which sanctioned and participated in the making of the picture, now at Loew's Criterion.

He was a physicist, social commentator and publisher, known for both his polemical stances and his erudition. Often struggling financially, Streitman set up several short-lived periodicals, and involved himself in the cultural and political debates, from 1889 to the time of his death. In his early years, he was a promoter of natural selection ideas, and a translator of Marxist and naturalist literature. A Romanian Jew who only preserved loose links with Judaism, Streitman left socialism behind before World War I, moving closer to the National Liberal Party, working alongside Ion G. Duca and Constantin Banu; he returned to public life in the 1920s as an anticommunist. He then affiliated with the People's Party, serving two terms in the Senate of Romania, where he represented Bukovina. He associated with figures on the Romanian far-right, including Octavian Goga and Pamfil »òeicaru, and eventually joined the National Agrarian Party in 1932. However, in the late 1930s, the ascent of antisemitism put his political career on hold. Streitman turned to collaboration with the military-fascist dictatorship of Ion Antonescu during World War II, becoming president of the Central Jewish Office. This assignment pitted him against non-collaborationists such as A. L. Zissu. However, his was a ceremonial office, with many of its functions supplanted by the executive leader, Nandor Gingold. Streitman survived the war by a few years, but, unlike Gingold, was never brought before the Romanian People's Tribunals. Biography =Early years= Streitman was a native of Piatra Neam»õ town, which is located in mountainous Western Moldavia.Podoleanu, p. 311; Streitman, \\"LegƒÉturile...\\", p. 462 He was born into the Judaic religion, and converted to Romanian Orthodoxy later in life, but was again a practicing Jew by 1941.Deletant, p. 122; Vago, p. 700 Like the majority of Romanian Jews living before 1920, Streitman was non-emancipated and not yet eligible for Romanian citizenship.Durnea, \\"Primii pa»ôi...\\", p. 29 Young Streitman was privately tutored, in both German and French, by the Count Jurawski, a Polish refugee. As he recalled decades later, \\"the all-knowing, all-forgiving\\" Jurawski was also an amateur scientist who introduced his pupils, and Moldavians in general, to Lamarckism and Darwinism.Streitman, \\"LegƒÉturile...\\", p. 462 Enrolled at high school, Streitman also followed Romanian politics, and was close to the budding socialist movement of students. In 1889, he began collaborating with Garabet IbrƒÉileanu's journal »òcoala NouƒÉ, appearing alongside the young socialists Izabela Andrei, Panait Mu»ôoiu, Raicu Ionescu-Rion. His articles covered a vast category of subjects, introducing the Romanian public to developments in sociology, hard science, and philology.Cioculescu et al., p. 952 The only speaker of German in that group, he is presumably by some as the author of articles signed I. Chilieanu (others believe this was IbrƒÉileanu's own pen name). Both the anonymous article and Streitman's signed pieces discuss the differences between literary naturalism and realism, and the naturalism vs. \\"pornography\\" debate of the 1880s.Cioculescu et al., p. 954; Opri»ô, pp. 33‚Äì34 Streitman was educated abroad, and trained in several fields. He studied physics and chemistry at the universities of G√∂ttingen, Zurich, Berlin, and then at the Technical College Stuttgart.Podoleanu, p. 311 Although he had become an expatriate, he continued to send his articles to »òcoala NouƒÉ, before it ultimately succumbed in May 1890.Cioculescu et al., p. 952; Opri»ô, pp. 32, 34 In Germany, Streitman was university colleagues with several prominent Romanian intellectuals of various political hues: Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu, Gheorghe Gh.

He also traveled out of Central Europe, and heard lectures in philosophy at Rome University. He eventually obtained a Sc.D. in physical chemistry, and a license degree in Philosophy. G.

Streitman is in the back row, holding up the red flag; to his right, Henric Sanielevici and Ion PƒÉun-Pincio Reportedly, the young writer made his full debut in journalism in 1894, when he contributed to the radical-liberal newspaper Rom√¢nul. However, he was by then affiliated with the Sotir Circle of socialists, Bucharest, and began contributing to the socialist magazine, Munca. Among his colleagues there was a female journalist, Rachel Vermont, who became his wife.Constantin Titel Petrescu, Socialismul √Æn Rom√¢nia. 1835 ‚Äì 6 septembrie 1940, p. 91. Bucharest: Dacia Traiana, [n. y.] Together, they completed and circulated translations of scientific and scientistic literature. In 1894, Henric and Rachel Streitman published the first volume of Max Nordau's Degeneration.Anghelu»õƒÉ et al., p. 408Teodora Dumitru, Re»õeaua modernitƒÉ»õilor: Paul de Man ‚Äì Matei CƒÉlinescu ‚Äì Antoine Compagnon, p. 216.

The pair highlighted the connections between Nordau and socialism, but also introduced footnotes claiming to correct the author for his disagreements with Marxism. A year later, the literary duo returned with a version of August Bebel's Woman.Podoleanu, p. 312 =Prezentul and Viitorul= Streitman's work was soon acknowledged in the literary profession, and discussed by Constantin Stamatin- Nazone in his 1894 essay Profilurƒ≠ (\\"Profiles\\").Anghelu»õƒÉ et al., p. 344 As argued by historian of journalism G. BrƒÉtescu, Streitman impressed and influenced the greats of Romanian journalism with his \\"subtle, malicious, ironic, doubting, often indulgent\\" writing style. Moreover, BrƒÉtescu writes, Streitman was an \\"erudite\\" and a competent reader of both secular and religious literature. However, his political views were the subject of controversy: in June 1900, Streitman and Petre I. Sturdza traveled to Budapest, attending the premiere of Radu D. Rosetti's play, O lec»õie, and being f√™ted by Hungarian journalists. According to Gazeta Transilvaniei, this implied that Streitman had \\"Hungarian sympathies\\", and had thus befriended Romania's rivals.\\"Scirile dÃ¶ilei. Representarea unei piese rom√¢nescƒ≠ la Budapesta\\", in Gazeta Transilvaniei, Issue 125/1900, pp. 2‚Äì3 In 1902, Streitman followed up with the booklet Oamenii zilei.

Petra»ôcu, officially admitted him in December 1904. Victor Durnea, \\"Constituirea SocietƒÉ»õii Scriitorilor Rom√¢ni (I)\\", in Revista Rom√¢nƒÉ (ASTRA), Issue 40/2005 With Dumitru Karnabatt as his secretary, Streitman was putting out a new Bucharest newspaper, Observatorul (\\"The Observer\\").Anuarul Bucurescilor pe anul 1904, p. 14. Bucharest: Carol G√∂bl, 1904 He took his journalistic career further when he a new daily, Prezentul (\\"The Now\\") and, in 1908, the weekly Cuvinte Libere (\\"Free Words\\"). Prezentul was engaged in polemics with Furnica, the satirical magazine. The latter hosted rhyming jokes about Streitman's supposed sensationalism.Cyrano (George Ranetti), \\"Kneazul Moruzzi la Mo»ôi\\", in Furnica, Issue 39/1905, p. 7 Streitman's coworkers and employees were Rudolf Uhrinowsky, ridiculed by Furnica for his unusual surname,\\"Pentru D.

T. Stamatiad, and Eugeniu Sperantia.Mihail Cruceanu, De vorbƒÉ cu trecutul..., p. 40. Bucharest: Editura Minerva, 1973. According to Eftimiu, Prezentul was a struggling business, occupying an unheated room on Macca Arcade, with Streitman often missing out on payments for his staff.Eftimiu, pp. 130‚Äì133 In March 1910, Streitman's entire mobile property was confiscated by court order, and auctioned off to pay off his debt to an R.

Corpul portƒÉreilor tribunalului Ilfov\\", in Monitorul Oficial, Issue 290/1911, p. 12125 The two papers did not survive this, and Streitman returned to regular publishing work. He was soon appointed editor in chief of Viitorul, a newspaper put out by the National Liberal Party, with Ion G. Duca and Constantin Banu as managers, while he was also a \\"very close\\" collaborator of Banu's own review, FlacƒÉra.Mihail »òerban, \\"Cu d. Const. Banu, evoc√¢nd trecutul.

In January 1913, Streitman also became involved with Romania's first journalists' union, the General Association of the Press. Alongside Karnabatt, Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Constantin Costa-Foru, Scarlat Lahovary, Constantin Mille, Barbu BrƒÉni»ôteanu, I. Hussar, he held seat on a steering committee which approved of new entries.\\"Asocia»õia generalƒÉ a presei\\", in Gazeta IlustratƒÉ, Issue 13/1913, p. 12; Constantin Bacalba»ôa, Bucure»ôtii de altƒÉ datƒÉ.

Bucharest: Editura Ziarului Universul, 1936 In 1910 and 1911, Streitman worked as a translator for Biblioteca Lumen company, publishing Henri Murger's Sc√®nes de la vie de boh√®me, Bebel's Women and Socialism, and the short stories of Vladimir Korolenko. Streitman's version of Henri James de Rothschild's play, La Rampe, was used in production by the Alexandru Davila company. N. D. Cocea, a fellow socialist and a theater chronicler, noted that the production failed, not least of all because of Streitman's adaptation. According to Cocea, Streitman had an \\"elevated style\\" of writing, but was also a \\"very busy man\\", which meant that his text was published with many grammatical mistakes.N. D. Cocea, \\"Cronica teatralƒÉ. Deschiderea stagiunii\\", in Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Issue 9/1910, pp. 476‚Äì477 =World War I and People's Party= One of Streitman's last journalistic ventures for 1913 was a series of interviews on the \\"Jewish Question\\", which was published as a brochure by the Union of Native Jews. A Romanian rival, Romulus Cioflec, argued that the set mainly featured known philosemites such as Alexandru Ciurcu and Constantin G. Dissescu.Romulus Cioflec, \\"In chestia evreiascƒÉ. O anchetƒÉ a 'Uniunii evreilor pƒÉm√¢nteni' √Æn lumea politicƒÉ rom√¢neascƒÉ\\", in Gazeta Transilvaniei, Issue 265/1913, p. 2 Streitman's advocacy came to a halt during the debates and campaigns of World War I. In 1914, when Romania was still neutral territory, he published a monograph on the life and ideas of Jean Jaur√®s, the recently assassinated SFIO leader. His old adversaries at Furnica alleged that he was in business with his National Liberal contacts, a middleman for \\"compensation\\" exports to countries of the Central Powers.Kiriak Napadarjan (George Ranetti), \\"Bra»ôoave\\", in Furnica, Issue 15/1915, p. 8 Streitman stayed behind enemy lines after the occupation of southern Romania. According to several accounts, he was picked up as a hostage by the German Army, and interned for a while at Tismana Monastery.\\"Cuv√¢ntarea dlui Dr. Valeriu Pop...\\", p. 4 He was active in occupied Bucharest following Romania's armistice, an editorial director of Virgil Arion's Rena»ôterea newspaper, which promoted reconciliation with the Germans. According to Alexandru Macedonski of Literatorul (himself a Germanophile), Streitman's arrival at Rena»ôterea was good news, Streiman being \\"one of the most brilliant Romanian journalists\\", \\"a man of great culture and a writer of great talent\\".Alexandru Macedonski, \\"Paginile zilei. Apari»õiunea Rena»ôterei\\" in Literatorul, Issue 2/1918, p. 7 After the German capitulation, Streitman returned at the center of Romanian cultural life. He became known as the owner of a library and art salon, Hasefer, which occupied a Venetian-style villa in Bucharest. In January 1919, he was at the forefront of trade unionism in Greater Romania, becoming co-founder of the Union of Professional Journalists (UZP). At age 44, he was the oldest member, unanimously voted in as UZP President following a proposal made by Pamfil »òeicaru. The journalist then reentered politics, now as a committed anticommunist. As BrƒÉtescu writes, he rejected socialism after the October Revolution, and supported the National Liberal Party without joining its ranks. Before the electoral year 1920, Streitman joined the politically diverse People's Party (PP), where he worked alongside the Romanian nationalist poet, Octavian Goga. The Jewish journalist sent articles to the PP's own press organ, √éndreptarea.Scurtu, p. 57 He was an enthusiastic follower of the party leader, General Alexandru Averescu. In retrospect, he spoke of Averescu as an \\"imperturbable and incorruptible\\" figures, chosen by providence to enact a program of \\"prosperity and order\\".Scurtu, pp. 57‚Äì58 Streitman was nominated for an eligible seat in a Jewish circumscription, in the newly attached region of Transylvania. Goga campaigned in his favor, telling Jewish voters that \\"a Jewish intellectual of the Old Kingdom\\" would be best positioned to advance their demands; Streitman failed at convincing them, probably because Transylvanian Jews wished to be considered separate from the Old Kingdom Jews.Lya Benjamin, \\"The Determinants of Jewish Identity in Inter-War Transylvania\\", Erd√©lyi Magyar Adatbank reprint (originally published in the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Studia Judaica, 1996, pp. 68‚Äì77); retrieved September 19, 2012 More recognition of his public role in Jewish and Romanian life came in early 1921, when the PP government assigned him to welcome back in Romania Moses Gaster, the expelled Jewish community leader and scholar. Streitman met Gaster at Curtici, and led him to Arad, inspiring his subsequent address to the city's Jewish community.MƒÉnescu, pp. 89‚Äì90 Following the 1920 setback, Streitman focused his political ambitions on another one of Greater Romania's newer regions, campaigning for the Jewish vote in Bukovina during the race of 1922. As a PP candidate, he was involved in the provincial conflict opposing two advocates of Jewish rights: Mayer Ebner, of the People's Council Party, and Benno Straucher, of the Jewish National People's Party. While Straucher became a National Liberal ally, Streitman and Karl Kl√ºger where signed by Ebner onto a People's Council Party list for the Senate: Streitman for Storojine»õ, Kl√ºger for CernƒÉu»õi.Mihai, pp. 88‚Äì89, 99‚Äì100 Streitman worked as a councilor for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which probably interrupted his senatorial mandate. Records of the time describe him as \\"formerly a senator\\".MƒÉnescu, p. 89 =1920s controversy= At that stage, Streitman was being courted by the radical modernists and the avant-garde. Resuming his contacts with the socialists, he with N. D. Cocea's leftist review, Facla. In his articles there, Streitman used the pen name Omul de pe stradƒÉ (\\"Man on the street\\"). Streitman's essays were also featured in Contimporanul, a political and art magazine put out by Cocea's pupil, Ion Vinea: his name appears Contimporanul pages from the very first issue, on June 3, 1922. He thus joined the original Contimporanul crew, which mainly comprised left-wing or politically independent social critics, generally adverse to the National Liberal Party. These included, among others, Eugen Filotti, Benjamin Fondane, Nicolae L. Lupu, Camil Petrescu, and Dem. Theodorescu.Cernat, pp. 132‚Äì133 Streitman was also one of the guest writers for the special issue honoring Arghezi's contribution to literary life.Cernat, pp. 148‚Äì149 As \\"V. DƒÉnoiu\\", Fondane celebrated in Streitman a contributor to both Romanian journalism and Romanian literature: \\"[In Streitman,] the Jews have given us a journalist who could become illustrious in any foreign literature, considering his gracious style, his subtlety and delicious irony.\\" V. DƒÉnoiu, \\"Evreii √Æn Cultura Rom√¢nƒÉ. I\\", in Contimporanul, Issues 39‚Äì40/1923, [p. 4] (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library). For the identification of Fondane as \\"DƒÉnoiu\\", see Sofia Milancovici, \\"Benjamin Fundoianu / Benjamin Fondane: o biografie rom√¢no- francezƒÉ\\", in the Goldi»ô University of Arad Studii de »òtiin»õƒÉ »ôi CulturƒÉ, Issue 1 (12), March 2008, p. 77 In July 1923, Streitman represented the Jewish Romanians at a congress of ethnic minority journalists, hosted by √Årp√°d Pa√°l in Arad. \\"Congresul ziari»ôtilor minoritari la Arad\\", in Vestul Rom√¢niei, Issue 17/1923, p. 3 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Also that year, he collected a volume of his Revizuiri (\\"Revisions\\"), republishing his 1894 translation from Nordau in 1924; his wife Rachel remained focused on Darwinist literature, and, before the echoes of the Scopes Trial were first felt in Romania, had translated a Darwinian popularization booklet by √âmile Ferri√®re.I. Florin, \\"√én jurul afacerii din Dayton. Ce e darwinismul?\\", in AdevƒÉrul, August 8, 1925, p. 2 Overall, according to his colleague Fondane, Streitman remained an \\"isolated\\" journalist, shunned by his press colleagues, \\"many of whom are Jews\\". Eventually, two Jewish avant-garde magazines took up his work: Puntea de Filde»ô and Isac Ludo's Adam. Both Streitman and Kl√ºger were reelected to Senate on the Averescu‚ÄìEbner platform during the race of May‚ÄìJune 1926, which returned the PP to government.Mihai, pp. 90, 100 The PP's selection was hotly contested by Romania's other right- wing venues, who accused Streitman of harboring anti-Romanian sentiments, and implied that his patron, Goga, was politically incompetent. A rumor circulated that, at the height of the world war, Streitman had called the Romanians \\"a gang of thieves, consumed with alcoholism and syphilis\\".\\"Cuv√¢ntarea dlui Dr. Valeriu Pop...\\", p. 4; \\"Daltonismul na»õional\\", in Chemarea Tinerimei Rom√¢ne, Issue 7/1926, p. 2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The antisemitic attack on Streitman was taken up in Parliament by the opposition National-Christian Defense League (or LANC), through the voice of Transylvanian Valeriu Pop.

Papp-Craiova argued: \\"Streitman was the only Jew to have exhibited a dignified attitude during the war. [...] this particular Jew has never described himself as a Jew, but has always said he was a Romanian.\\" Streitman was among the diplomats who worked at tightening Romania's links with the Polish Republic, in the context of the Polish‚ÄìRomanian Alliance. He was an official rapporteur at the Polish‚ÄìRomanian Conference, held at Gala»õi, and contributed an essay on the history behind that cooperation. It was taken up by Societatea de M√¢ine magazine, with an editorial note announcing that Streitman was working on three \\"literary volumes\\": √éntre da »ôi nu (\\"Between Yes and No\\"), Ziua e scurtƒÉ (\\"The Day Is Short\\"), Elogiul ipocriziei (\\"In Praise of Hypocrisy\\").Streitman, \\"LegƒÉturile...\\", p. 461 Of his planned volumes, only √éntre da »ôi nu came out, in 1928, at Editura Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, earning attention as a \\"paradoxical and savory\\" work.Leon Feraru, \\"Rumanian Literary News\\", in The Romanic Review, No. 2/1929, p. 185 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Averescu's premiership ended abruptly in June 1927. Streitman still served in the Foreign Ministry after the National Liberals carried the day, and, during the mandate of Nicolae Titulescu, traveled extensively in Europe. Nevertheless, he maintained a correspondence on the subject with Averescu, informing him about things he had \\"seen, heard, and thought about\\" during his trips.Scurtu, pp. 58, 59 By 1928, he had returned to his career in the national press, managing the newspapers Diminea»õa and AdevƒÉrul. This period coincided with the rise of a National Peasants' Party, which threatened with revolution. Its messages, including alarmist announcements by Ionel »öƒÉranu, were given exposure by Streitman; during October, Streitman was called in to testify at »öƒÉranu's trial, which lasted into 1929.Marian Mo»ôneagu, \\"Presa rom√¢nƒÉ interbelicƒÉ »ôi starea de asediu.

Meanwhile, the People's Party made Streitman its Lower Chamber candidate in the December election, moving him from Storojine»õ to CernƒÉu»õi.Mihai, pp. 93, 100 =Between Facla and the far- right= 1928 manifesto of the National-Christian Defense League, published under the swastika logo, describing its hostility toward \\"the kikes\\" and \\"the Judaized Romanians\\" Although no longer holding a seat in Parliament, Streitman was one of Romania's delegates to the 25th Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference,Compte rendu de la XXVe conf√©rence tenue √† Berlin du 23 au 28 ao√ªt 1928. Publi√© par le bureau interparlementaire, p. 547. Geneva: √âditions Payot, 1928 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) while also representing Romania within a journalists' version of the Little Entente, alongside Filotti and Emil Fagure.\\"Conferin»õa Micii antante a presei. Dezbaterile »ôedin»õei de eri dupƒÉ amiazƒÉ\\", in AdevƒÉrul, June 22, 1928, p. 3 He also remained active as an adviser of the Romanian far-right. In his own pamphlet, Mustul care fierbe (\\"The Frothing Must\\"), Octavian Goga paid homage to Streitman as the \\"fine analyst\\". Goga cited his admiration for Streitman against those who reproached him his antisemitism: \\"I have never professed that stupid kind of intolerance.\\"Octavian Goga, Mustul care fierbe, p. 97. Bucharest: Imprimeria Statului, [n. y.] At the time, Streitman also advised and financed his friend »òeicaru to set up the nationalist daily, Curentul. In its original edition, this political tribune employed other Jewish men of letters, among them F. Brunea-Fox and Moses Rosen. In 1930, Streitman launched a new magazine of his own, the short-lived Observatorul Politic »ôi Social (\\"Political and Social Observer\\"). Streitman signed up for the 1931 electoral campaign as a PP candidate, again in Bukovina.Mihai, pp. 94, 100 When, in 1932, Goga left the PP to found his own National Agrarian Party (PNA), Streitman followed suit. Three years later, this group merged with Streitman's old adversaries, the LANC. Paradoxically, the Jewish Streitman became an election agent for the resulting National Christian Party (PNC), a notoriously antisemitic force. The PNA and PNC both had fascist leanings and, according to political scientist Manus I. Midlarsky, were ideologically close to the more powerful Iron Guard. He writes: \\"The PNA had been founded by the poet Octavian Goga who propounded an anti-Semitic populism. [The PNC and the Iron Guard] would compete for the right-wing nationalist votes\\".Manus I. Midlarsky, Origins of Political Extremism: Mass Violence in the Twentieth Century and Beyond, p. 298. Cambridge etc.: Cambridge University Press, 2011. Although working within the PNA and befriending the fascists, Streitman still assisted with leftist causes. Also in 1932, he joined the staff of Facla, where he was colleagues with several leftist and rightist political commentators: Sergiu Dan, Ion CƒÉlugƒÉru, N. Davidescu, Sandu Eliad, Nicolae Carandino. Geo »òerban, \\"Causeries du lundi\\", in Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, Issue 25/2000 Following up on √éntre da »ôi nu, he returned in late 1933 with the volume Mi se pare cƒÉ...

According to PƒÉlt√¢nea: \\"Mr. Henri Streitman reveals his very own manner [...] of searching for the truth through the most distant detours, those that run into surprises and open up grand perspectives.\\" Pompiliu PƒÉlt√¢nea, \\"Chronique de Roumanie\\", in Mercure de France, Issue 867, August 1934, p. 643 (digitized by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France Gallica digital library) Doctor Ygrec, the reviewer at AdevƒÉrul, found the book amusing overall, but objected to its \\"commonplace\\" jokes about God as an anthropomorphic deity. Underneath this covering, \\"it would seem to me that Mr. Streiman is a religious man\\". Streitman was still a confidant of Duca, by then National Liberal chairman, who ultimately became Prime Minister in late 1933. He recorded Duca's premonition of his assassination by the Iron Guard: \\"Now begins the I. G. Duca tragedy...\\"G. I. Duca, Cronica unui rom√¢n √Æn veacul XX, Vol. II p. 106. Munich: Jon Dumitru Verlag, 1984 As noted months after by Argetoianu, Streitman had remained politically confused, and wrote for \\"all sorts of publications\\", driven mainly by material needs, though he was also \\"always meaningful\\" and \\"intelligent\\", a \\"superior Semite\\". Argetoianu's notebook records a joke about \\"Streitman's salute\\", which was neither the fascist salute nor the communist raised fist, but \\"arm extended, palm turned up, to pick up something or other\\".Argetoianu, p. 369 He also recorded how Streitman and another journalist, Clarnet, colluded to obtain larger gifts from their political patron Titulescu.Argetoianu, pp. 369‚Äì370 A while after the Duca assassination, Streitman was a correspondent for N. D. Cocea's far-left magazine, Reporter, which published his essays (signed Quidam and Alcest); but also worked with the right-wing Ion Gigurtu at Libertatea.\\"Caleidoscopul vie»õii intelectuale. Litere, »ôtiin»õƒÉ, artƒÉ: CƒÉr»õi »ôi reviste\\", in AdevƒÉrul, February 7, 1936, p. 2 At the time, he was working on an edition of works by Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, which was to feature his comparative essay on the links between RƒÉdulescu's poetry and the Bible.Alexandru Rosetti, \\"Funda»õia pentru literaturƒÉ »ôi artƒÉ Regele Carol II.

When the Iron Guard imposed its National Legionary State, Streitman found himself included on lists of \\"Judaic writers\\" or \\"Hebrew thistles\\", who had \\"nothing in common with the spiritual structure of the Romanian peasant\\". Ladmiss Andreescu, \\"Iudeii √Æn literatura noastrƒÉ\\", in Universul Literar, Issue 29/1940, p. 2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) The Guardists were eventually thrown out by ConducƒÉtor Ion Antonescu, but this turn of events only increased pressures on the Jewish community. Radu Lecca, the Jewish Affairs Commissioner, began organizing a system of coercion, which was to be supervised in his name by the so-called Central Jewish Office (CE). It was seen by the German envoys as the Romanian answer to a Judenrat, capable of assisting in the enforcement of the \\"Final Solution\\".Deletant, p. 121; Edward Kanterian, \\"Subiectivitate »ôi obiectivitate √Æn Jurnalul lui Mihail Sebastian\\", in Revista 22, Bucure»ôtiul Cultural supplement, Issue 11/2007; Vago, pp. 696, 707‚Äì708, 717‚Äì718 Streitman probably owed his appointment to the CE to his good rapport with all sides of the political spectrum, and especially to his friendship with Antonescu's friend, Veturia Goga.Deletant, p. 122; Vago, pp. 700, 701‚Äì702 According to University of Haifa scholar Bela Vago, he may also have been favored by a special German envoy, Gustav Richter, who also approved of Lazar Halberthal (Streitman's proposal for the Bucharest Jewish Community Presidency, and formerly a Macabi Bucure»ôti sportsman).Vago, pp. 702, 703 The CE was also afforded some recognition by the underground Union of Romanian Jews, whose leader Wilhelm Filderman allowed colleague David \\"Dadu\\" Rosenkranz to head the CE's Section of Professional Reeducation.

Din via»õa unui avocat »ôi lider evreu din Rom√¢nia √Æn secolul XX\\", in Revista ProLitera, February 3, 2018 The journalist remained a figurehead, publishing appeals to calm and obedience, and leaving most administrative work to his second-in-command, Nandor Gingold, M. D.Deletant, p. 122; Vago, pp. 700‚Äì701 Ethnically Jewish, but a lapsed Catholic by religion, Gingold justified his own compliance by noting that obvious resistance to Nazi demands would bring immediate destruction upon the Romanian Jews.Deletant, p. 122 Similarly, in the Jewish weekly Gazeta EvreiascƒÉ, Streitman informed his fellow Jews that the moment required a special kind of reasoning: \\"with our heads, and not with our nerves, and not with our backbone.\\"Vago, p. 701 Although conflicted due to the religious prohibitions, the CE had to comply with an official order to relocate the Jewish cemetery on Sevastopol Street. Its eviction in May 1942 was overseen by Streitman, Gingold, Halberthal, and a Sephardi delegate, Marco Presente.Adrian Ciofl√¢ncƒÉ, \\"Erasing Memory. the Destruction of the Old Jewish Cemeteries in Bucharest and Ia»ôi during Ion Antonescu's Regime\\", in Revista de Istorie a Evreilor, Issue 1 (16‚Äì17), 2016, pp. 323‚Äì324 This attitude made Streitman and adversary of the dissident Jews, who still refused to take Lecca's orders. At some point in 1942, Streitman found himself opposed by the Zionist activist A. L. Zissu, who called him a traitor and a renegade. According to historian Hildrun Glass, Zissu was making himself known as the \\"intransigent\\" community leader, and, as result of his conflict with Streitman, was interned at the T√¢rgu Jiu camp for political prisoners.Hildrun Glass, \\"C√¢teva note despre activitatea iui Avram L.

See also Cazacu, pp. 57‚Äì58; Vago passim While providing Jewish labor for Antonescu's regime, Rosenkranz also directed relief efforts for survivors of the Ia»ôi pogrom and Vapniarka. Philosopher Iosif BrucƒÉr was asked by Streitman to lead the CE's Education Department, but refused all collaboration.Gligor, pp. 23, 99 Designated by the Zionist Executive to that same position, Theodor Loewenstein-Lavi used it as a platform for Jewish nationalism. In September 1942, his appointment was reviewed by Richter, who was enraged by Lavi's history as an anti-Nazi; he was dismissed, and the Zionist Executive was outlawed.Mitricioaei, pp. 381‚Äì382, 387‚Äì388 Streitman himself only served in the CE between February and December 1942, being succeeded by Gingold.Cazacu, p. 57 The new CE executive subsequently included Streitman and BrucƒÉr, alongside banker Aristide Blank, on a list of Jewish hostages; according to BrucƒÉr, this list showed Gingold's priorities: \\"he was not there to protect the Jews, but to persecute and remove them\\".Gligor, pp. 100‚Äì101 His last years brought his return to activism, this time as a Revisionist Zionist, working for a massive Jewish resettlement in British Palestine. King Michael's Coup of 1944 toppled Antonescu and brought Romania into the Allied Camp. In February 1946, Streitman's colleagues at the CE leadership were brought in front of the Romanian People's Tribunals, whereupon Gingold and Vasile IsƒÉceanu were given life sentences.Lucian NastasƒÉ, \\"Sf√¢r»ôit de istorie.

They are a type of point of care test, a test designed to be used by a healthcare provider at patient contact. Point of care tests often allow for rapid detection of a specific biomarker without specialized lab equipment and training; this aids in diagnosis and allows therapeutic action to be initiated more quickly. Flow-through tests began development in the early 1980s and were the first type of immunostrip to be developed, although lateral flow tests have subsequently become the dominant immunostrip point of care device.  History  The first flow- through test was developed in 1985 to test for the presence of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin in urine.  Principle of flow-through tests  Flow- through assays are by principle binding assays. In practice they are mostly applied to detect the interaction of an antibody, as from a sample of the test subject's blood, with immobilized antigens, resulting in the formation of an antigen-antibody complex. However, other types of capture-assays are technically feasible, including small molecule capture-assays or antigen tests. Flow-through assays for the detection of mycotoxins, based on ELISA, have been available since the 1980s and can be used in field analyses. Flow- through tests typically come in the form of cassettes divided into four parts: an upper casing, a reactive membrane panel, an absorbent panel, and a lower casing. To perform a test, a diluted sample is applied to the reactive membrane panel and flows through to the absorbent pad, with the target analyte being captured in the membrane. The membrane is then washed to remove unbound, non-target molecules, washed again with a solution containing a signal reagent, and washed again to remove unbound signal reagent. If the analyte was present in the original sample, then by the end of this process it should be bound to the membrane, with the signal reagent bound to it, revealing (usually visually) the presence of the analyte on the membrane.  Advantages and disadvantages  Flow-through tests can be performed more quickly than lateral flow tests. They exhibit good sensitivity to antibodies, but their detection of antigens is generally less sensitive than lateral flow tests.

History  Originally called the National League of the Blind, the NLB was founded in 1893, and registered as a trade union in 1899.Arthur Ivor Marsh, Trade Union Handbook, p.132 It affiliated to the Trades Union Congress in 1902. It was initially led by Ben Purse, a piano tuner,\\"The National League of the Blind\\", Public and Commercial Services Union born in Salford in 1874. During the early 1900s its General Secretary was Thomas Summerbell.Margaret 'Espinasse, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.IV, pp.165-166 The League organised its first strike in 1912. In April 1920 it organised a march that converged towards Trafalgar Square from Leeds, Manchester and Newport in support of what became the Blind Persons Act 1920. This action inspired the later Jarrow March. Purse left the union in 1921, forming the National Union of the Professional and Industrial Blind, which later became the National Association of Blind Workers in 1933, and focused on providing benefits to its members.Arthur Ivor Marsh, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, Vol. 5, p.480 The National League of the Blind organised a further march in 1936, which met with less success, although it did achieve a further Blind Persons Act in 1938. The NLB campaigned strongly for and organised its membership within state-provided sheltered employment workshops for blind workers, and it resisted any charity-based alternatives in welfare or employment for blind people. In later years this tradition of advocacy contributed, with other organisations of disabled people, to some advances in disabled people's welfare, including the introduction of disability benefits and the creation of the Disability Rights Commission and the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act. The union voted to rename itself the \\"National League of the Blind and Disabled\\" in 1968, and by 1979 had a membership of reportedly just under 5000. A book giving a detailed history of the League was published in 2015 - Blind Workers Against Charity, by Matthias Reiss.  Recent times  In 1981 the NLBD was one of the founding organisations which created the radical British Council of Organisations of Disabled People. The NLBD was represented by Mike Barratt, George Salughter, and two observers at the meeting in London on 13 June 1981. By February 2000 it had 1,755 members, and it merged with the much larger Iron and Steel Trades Confederation on 8 February 2000 to form the basis of the nascent millennial trade union Community, four years before the latter's official launch. By 2014 the membership number was \\"around 800 people\\". General Secretaries :1897: Ben Purse (Northern Section of the League) :1899: Peter Miller :1900: William Banham :1903: Joe Gregory :1926: G.

She received her PhD in social psychology from Ohio State University in 1986. Major Contributions Devine's 1989 study, Stereotypes and prejudice: Their automatic and controlled components, received the prestigious Scientific Impact Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, recognizing her paper's lasting impact that fundamentally altered the landscape of prejudice and stereotyping research. Her paper demonstrated that stereotypes and prejudicial emotions can be activated automatically, in opposition to one's explicit, controlled beliefs. This insight has spurred four decades of research on the automaticity and control of prejudice. In 2012, she developed a prejudice intervention that taught participants cognitive techniques to overcome non-intentional race bias, which was able to reduce implicit bias up to two months after the intervention.

Cox, Lyn Abramson and Steven Hollon, recently proposed the integrated perspective on prejudice and depression, which unites cognitive theories of depression with theories of prejudice, casting them in a common terminology and identifying ways that depression research can inform prejudice research and vice versa. Devine, along with William T. L. Cox, Alyssa Bischmann, and Janet Hyde at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, have suggested that ‚Äúgaydar‚Äù is an alternate label for using stereotypes to infer orientation (e.g., inferring that fashionable men are gay) (2015). These studies have revealed that orientation is not visible from the face‚Äîparticipants did, however, readily infer orientation from stereotypic attributes (e.g., fashion, career). Compared to a control group, people stereotyped more when led to believe in gaydar, whereas people stereotyped less when told gaydar is an alternate label for stereotyping. It was concluded that ‚Äúgaydar‚Äù serves as a legitimizing myth that disguises and perpetuates stereotyping.

Gerzon continued to host ship visits to the memorial site, including visits for ship's crews to clean up the area and polish the plaques. Additionally, visits include an opportunity to read the names of those who have died because, according to Gerzon, \\"In Jewish tradition, if you read the names of the dead out loud, they never die.\\" Gerzon has stated that the USO's goal is not to move mountains, but instead, \\"to move a few people's hearts,\\" and she believes that efforts such as this one help that occur.

The term drag is sometimes included to form three separate but related concepts in the art of animation. Definition Follow through and overlapping action are closely related techniques which, when applied to animation, can help to render movement more realistically by more closely obeying the laws of physics. At the Disney Studio, Walt Disney was eager to push his animators to improve their work and develop their skills. He told them: :\\"Things don't come to a stop all at once guys; first there's one part and then another\\"Thomas and Johnston, p.59 The animators, keen to make their work feel more convincing, developed the concepts of \\"Follow Through\\" and \\"Overlapping Action\\", though the concepts were so closely related that they were not always easy to distinguish. Thomas and Johnston identified five areas of motion where these principles would apply: 1\\\\. A character might have a coat or long ears, and these parts would keep moving once the figure had stopped moving. The ears, or coat, would \\"follow through\\" even after the main action had stopped. 2\\\\. Bodies in motion do not move all at once, rather different parts of a body may move at different speeds. Therefore, as one part of the body stops, another part (such as an arm), might overlap or follow through the main action, slowly settling to a stop. 3\\\\. Loose flesh, such as a dog's floppy jowls, might move at a slower speed than the more solid parts of the character. These parts might drag behind the main action.Thomas and Johnston, p.60 4\\\\.

The church was rebuilt in stone during the 9th and 10th centuries; foundations of this church were discovered in 2008 beneath the present church when an investigative trench was dug. In 1120 Henry I gave St Lawrence‚Äôs along with the churches at Corbridge, Rothbury and Whittingham to his chaplain Richard de Aurea Valle. Upon his death, all four churches were given to and became part of the newly formed Diocese of Carlisle and would remain so until Newcastle became a separate diocese in 1882. =Present day church= Building of the church as we see it today began in 1132; it was constructed not only as a holy place but also as a sanctuary for the villagers in dangerous times. It had very substantial walls, with very narrow, high windows to keep out the enemy. On Saturday 13 July 1174, the day of the Battle of Alnwick, Donnchad II, Earl of Fife, commanding a column of the Scottish King William the Lion‚Äôs army, entered Warkworth and set fire to the town, killing 300 of the inhabitants who had taken refuge in the church. Around the year 1200 a tower was built at the western end of the church although the belfry and the spire were not added until the 14th century. In the 15th century the south aisle and entrance porch were added; above the porch there is a parvise which is reached by a spiral staircase; prior to 1736 it served as a schoolroom.

On 16 May 1761 John Wesley visited the church to preach a sermon whilst on a visit to nearby Alnwick. In 1860 there were extensive restorations with a new roof being applied, which resulted in the loss of the clerestory windows on the south wall. At the same time plaster was removed from the interior walls and the box pews were replaced by bench pews.\\"Church Guide - St Lawrence, Warkworth (leaflet)\\", No Author, Warkworth PCC, no ISBN, Gives general history of church and details of interior. =Post war developments= Changes to the church since World War II have seen pews removed from the south aisle and the floor relaid in Caithness stone in 1947.

The wall was built on shallow medieval foundations on alluvial sand and clay close to the tidal River Coquet. Investigations in 2006 showed that the wall was 19 inches out of line and in a dangerous condition; this resulted in the church being placed on English Heritage‚Äôs Buildings at Risk Register. In March 2009 work started to secure and stabilise the wall, repair any ensuing damage to the interior of the church and prevent further deterioration. Two new buttresses were built resting on 22-metre piles which went down to the bedrock. The work cost ¬£300,000 with the money coming from grant aid from English Heritage and from a successful fund-raising campaign by the Parochial Church Council.

He invited Karl Mauch to accompany him on his next trip, and in 1866 Mauch announced that he had found the Tati goldfields extending about which started the first gold rush in Southern Africa the following year. In 1869 the Englishman Daniel Francis came to hunt for gold on the river, before heading south to the Kimberley diamond fields in 1870. The gold was hard to extract, and the gold rush died down. Francis returned in 1880 and obtained mining rights from King Lobengula. Mining activity revived in the 1880s and 1890s, and Francistown was established in 1897 when the railway arrived.

The game was part of Milton Bradley's Floor Wars Series. The game was well known for its large board size and large playing pieces. History and development The game was released in 1986 in English and Spanish versions by Milton Bradley. Gameplay =Game board= The game board for Torpedo Run! was very large (46.5\\" x 34.5\\") and contains squares like a chessboard or checkerboard with 10 rows and 8 columns. It was designed to be played on the floor or a very large table. With the style of game play the floor was the preferred place since table top play could result in lost game pieces. =Game Pieces and Setup= The game contained 2 battleships (1 gray, 1 tan), 6 cruisers (3 gray, 3 tan), and 2 submarine shooters (1 gray, 1 tan). The battleships and cruisers had tower and gun pieces that were detachable, and needed to be mounted to the base hull of each ship by inserting a post with a hook down into a latch, held in tension by an internal rubber band. The latch was exposed to the outside of the ship through a narrow slit at the bottom of the hull, with all slits on only one side of the ship. The submarine could hold a column of tiny red plastic discs which could be fired at the larger ships by pulling a rubber band and post mechanism on the top of the submarine. Before play, the larger ships' hulls were loaded with the towers and guns, and the larger ships would be placed in any configuration with the slits facing the opponent. The submarines would be loaded with as many discs as could fit and the rubber band on the firing mechanism secured. =Game Play and Winning= The object of the game was to use the submarine to fire discs at opposing ships, scoring direct hits by shooting into the slits at the base of each ship, triggering the latch mechanism which would eject the gun or tower above, indicating a hit. Each ship consisted of two or three sections depending on the size of the piece. Once all sections were popped that ship was considered destroyed. There are no turns, the players simply agree to begin firing on a count of 3, then fire as fast as they can in a race to eliminate their opponent's ships first, leading to a fast-paced, chaotic experience similar to a later Milton Bradley game, Crossfire.

Design and development The Scoutchel is derived from the earlier APEV Demoichelle, itself an updated version of the pre-First World War Santos- Dumont Demoiselle. The Scoutchel features a strut-braced high-wing, a single- seat open cockpit without a cockpit fairing, fixed tricycle landing gear and a single engine mounted above the cockpit on the keel tube, in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing. The wings are the same as those used on the Pouchel Light and are built around a single aluminium spar, with ribs made from extruded polystyrene with plywood bracing, all bonded to fibreglass leading and trailing edges, covered in Dacron sailcloth. The span wing employs a NACA 23112 airfoil and has an area of , with an aspect ratio of 8:1. A unique roll control system is used as the aircraft has no ailerons. Instead the wings are pivoted to +4¬∞ and -2¬∞ to produce and control roll. The wings can be folded for ground transportation or storage. Recommended engines are the Rotax 377 or the Rotax 447 two-stroke powerplants, although it can also fit electric motors as well.

Roosevelt formulated freedom from fear as follows: \\"The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor‚Äîanywhere in the world.\\" The four freedoms of Roosevelt formed an important pillar of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that were adopted on December 10, 1948, by the United Nations General Assembly.Alfredsson, Gudmundur & Asbj√∏rn Eide (1999) The Universal UN Declaration of Human Rights: A Common Standard of Achievement, page 524, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, The freedom from fear is mentioned in the preamble of the Declaration.United Nations, Universal Declarations of Human Rights Inspiration In 1943, painter Norman Rockwell created Freedom from Fear, in his series of four paintings called Four Freedoms. It is an important concept for Burmese Aung San Suu Kyi, who published a book on it in 1991 with the title Freedom from Fear. In 1999 historian David M. Kennedy published a book called Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929‚Äì1945.

It is a cheaper, lower-end version of the Windows Phone 8X by HTC. Despite its availability in Canada, HTC announced that the 8S will not be sold in the United States because the company plans to focus instead on the 8X, which is considered its signature phone on the Windows operating system. Because of the limited memory available on this phone, certain applications and features will not be able to run.  Availability  In Canada, the HTC 8S was first available released for Virgin Mobile Canada on December 7, 2012. HTC plans to make the 8S available at Koodo Mobile, Mobilicity and Wind Mobile in 2013.  Reception  One week after launching the device, Virgin Mobile Canada reported that the phone has been \\"flying off the shelves\\". At that time, the Mobile Syrup blog stated that the 8S was \\"the best deal on a no-contract phone at the moment\\" The blog also praised the device's size and design, and claimed that the phone \\"makes a number of compromises [‚Ä¶] but it‚Äôs still able to perform [‚Ä¶] well\\". Ewan Spence from All About Windows Phone wrote: \\"While there are clear use cases for the 8S (and I can think of a few people in my family that would get by easily with the 8S) it feels like a missed opportunity. It's going to fall seriously short with anyone who is looking to really push the Windows Phone 8 platform.\\"  OS updates  The HTC Windows Phone 8S has received the Windows Phone 8.1 update, but has not been updated officially further to Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 (however, the latest 8.1 updates can be obtained via Microsoft's \\"Preview for Developers\\" app), despite its relatively better counterpart, the Windows Phone 8X, having received this latest update. As such, it has become highly unlikely that there will an update to Windows 10 Mobile for the 8S.

History  In 1978, a number of major car rental companies and larger independent car rental owners formed a national association that would share a unified voice when representing the car rental industry at legislative hearings. The association‚Äôs goal was to represent as many voters as possible so they welcomed the smaller auto rental franchise systems and companies to join ACRA. ACRA was chartered in San Francisco, California in April 1978. The first president was Eldon Barnard. Original members including Avis, National, Budget, Alamo, Thrifty Car Rental, Dollar, and numerous other rental car companies. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, there were many Senior Level company Executives, including some CEO‚Äôs of major rental car systems serving as president of the association. This list of distinguished industry executives included Joe James with National Car Rental, Don Himelfarb with Thrifty Car Rental, Gary Paxton with Dollar Rent A Car, Phil Schailer with Alamo Rent A Car, Sandford Miller with Budget Rental A Car, Bill McPike, Dan Huntoon and David Schaefer with Avis, and Wayne Kauffman with Enterprise Car Rental. ACRA is the industry voice on public policy issues facing the car rental industry. It is governed by a board of directors that represents a large cross-section of the car rental industry and acts in strict compliance with the antitrust laws. The association provides strategic media communications and consistent public ‚Äúvoice‚Äù.  Areas of activity  The American Car Rental Association operates on behalf of the U.S. car rental business by: (a) lobbying on the state and federal level, (b) analyzing and reporting on federal, state and local laws, (c) educating its membership about recent developments in public policy and court decisions, (d) providing appropriate services as needed to support these goals and organizing and (e) participating in the annual Car Rental Show.  Accomplishments ACRA is actively lobbying to eliminate excise taxes on car rental transactions in state and local governments. In Arizona, Florida, and the State of Washington taxes were eliminated or stopped. ACRA is actively engaged in pursuing federal legislation that would prohibit future excise taxes imposed solely on the car rental industry as discriminatory. ACRA fought hard to reduce MFR (Minimum Financial Responsibility) levels for rental car companies in Maine and thwarted efforts to increase these levels in New York. ACRA helped pass legislation in Arizona that shifted the company‚Äôs liability to a secondary position rather than primary thereby making the tortfeasor the first in line to pay personal injury claims when other insurance is available. ACRA was instrumental in the elimination of vicarious liability on a federal level, the Graves Amendment, and has been in the forefront of defeating numerous attempts at a repeal of this legislation. ACRA members have also prevailed in legal challenges to this law.  Members The American Car Rental Association is composed of rental car company members (‚Äúregular‚Äù members) and associate or vendor members. The major car rental companies include: * ACE Rent a Car * Advantage Rent a Car * Avis Budget Group * Enterprise Holdings * Fox Rent a Car * Green Motion Car and Van Rental * The Hertz Corporation * Nu Car Rentals * Payless Car Rental * Rent-a-Wreck * Uhaul Car Share * U-Save Auto Rental of America References External links * Car rental companies of the United States Trade associations based in the United States Organizations based in New York (state) Organizations established in 1978 Traveling business organizations Transportation organizations based in the United States 1978 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"American Car Rental Association"},{"id":"37062374","title":"Swimming at the 2012 Summer Paralympics ‚Äì Men's 100 metre freestyle S10"},{"id":"37062375","text":"Andrew Michael Parks (born December 3, 1991) is a former American rapper, record producer, and songwriter from Metro Detroit, Michigan.Maria A.
